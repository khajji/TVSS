PREVIOUSLY ON 24 The fbi believes They've detected where the next attack will take place. 
The chemical plant just outside kidron, ohio. 
What's our time frame? 
The tank could rupture in less than 15 minutes. 
Right now our best chance to stop this Is by finding dubaku and the cip device. 
400 psi. 
How long before the tank ruptures? 
Seven minutes. 
We've got a problem. 
I thought you killed almeida and bauer. 
Damn it! how did they find us?! 
I don't know! 
They're in the building. 
Disengage the cip module. 
Begin the offload. 
Jack, I've got the cip device! 
It's been destroyed. 
The matobos are safe. 
I'm taking them to the van. 
Copy that. 
You and bill do a sweep. 
see if you can find dubaku. 
We are not equipped to look for one man In a city of millions. 
We need additional resources. 
 The government? 
 they can't be trusted. 
We can't trust anybody. 
That's why we're working on the outside. 
President taylor can be trusted. 
Madame president, you need to listen to me. 
The people who rescued us, they have acquired the cip device. 
It's being destroyed, And your country's no longer under immediate threat. 
Who are these people? 
I'll tell you everything in person, But I must speak to you alone. 
Please get henry on the phone. 
Henry's unreachable. 
I've been trying to reach agent gedge, And he hasn't picked up. 
He said he was outside samantha roth's apartment Waiting for the first gentleman. 
You're telling me my husband's gone missing? 
Gedge is dead. 
What happened? 
Something went wrong. 
taylor killed gedge, I don't know how. 
Don't kill him. 
Bring him to me. 
THE FOLLOWING TAKES PLACE BETWEEN 3 PM AND 4 PM. 
You ARE CERTAIN YOU weren't followed? 
Yes. come on. help me get him inside. 
We can confirm at this point The tragedies that unfolded in the skies over washington And in kidron, ohio, were indeed acts of terrorism. 
But I am here to assure you that those responsible Are no longer a threat to this country. 
Their attempts to stop us from intervening In the Sangalan genocide have failed. 
We will not give in to terrorists. 
A short time ago, I gave the order For our troops to begin operations That will liberate the people of Sangala. 
We are confident that the juma regime will collapse swiftly, And that democracy will be restored Under the leadership Of prime minister ule motobo. 
You, you, come. 
Well done, agent vossler. 
I've got to go now. 
I've got a shift that starts at 4:00. 
Then go. 
your money will be wired to the usual account. 
The room is soundproof, mr. taylor. 
There's no point in screaming or trying to call for help. 
Elimu, remove mr. taylor's gag. 
You son of a bitch. 
You're behind my son's death. 
He was poking his nose where it did not belong. 
You'll never get away with this. 
you must know that. 
Everyone in the city is going be looking for me. 
You should be concerned with just one question, mr. taylor. 
Does your wife love you enough To call off the invasion of my country? 
For your sake, I hope the answer is yes. 
Activate the scrambling device. 
Our law enforcement agencies Will hunt down the people responsible And bring them to justice. 
I ask now that your thoughts and prayers Go to those who lost their lives today, To their families and loved ones, And to our troops who are putting their lives On the line in the name of freedom. 
Thank you. 
Good afternoon. 
Motobo's arrived. 
He and the others have been brought in secretly Through the underground entrance By agents I personally know and trust. 
Motobo told me the people he's bringing in Are responsible for saving his life And recovering the cip device. 
Who are they? 
Bill buchanan, whom I believe you met When he headed up ctu l.a., 
Fbi agent named renee walker And jack bauer. 
Bauer... 
He was one of motobo's kidnappers. 
Doesn't make sense. 
I know. 
Motobo asked me to listen to what they have to say, And I'm willing to do so. 
Send them in. 
The president's ready. 
Ule. 
I can't tell you How thankful we are that you and alama are safe. 
Thank you. 
she's with mr. buchanan's people now, 
Recovering. 
That you were subjected To such an ordeal On our soil is a source of shame both to me Personally and to my country. 
Madame president, My chief concern is for Sangala, not myself. 
May I ask what your timetable is For the invasion? 
I've issued the order To our military to proceed. 
I thank you with all my heart. 
You're doing my people a great service, Much as these people have done for your country. 
Now forgive me, prime minister, But I'm finding that hard to believe. 
I assure you, none of this is as it seems. 
But they're here to explain themselves. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, madame president, I must meet with my people  To discuss post-invasion plans. 
Of course. 
I want an explanation and I want it now. 
What the hell is going on?! 
Madame president, Six weeks ago, bill buchanan discovered That key members of your government Were working with general juma And colonel dubaku in an effort To undermine this nation's foreign policy Your foreign policy with regards to Sangala. 
You realize that that is an outrageous accusation? 
Yes, ma'am. 
Unfortunately, it's the truth. 
It explains why during this crisis, Every effort you made to stop dubaku failed. 
Bill, why didn't you come to me? 
I didn't know who I could trust or if you'd even believe me. 
So I formed A small group to locate and neutralize dubaku. 
Tony almeida and ultimately, jack, Joined me. 
Tony almeida was the one who put the cip device Into dubaku's hands In the first place. 
Using the cip device as bait was necessary To the undercover operation. 
We had to follow it back to dubaku. 
A lot of people Died on those planes, never mind what Could have happened at the chemical plant in kidron! 
Madame president, if I may, I was part Of the fbi task force assigned to recover the cip device, And I can personally vouch for what they're telling you. 
The loss of life was tragic, yes, But in my opinion, Everything these men have done saved the lives of thousands. 
If I choose to believe everything you're telling me, Where would you go from here? 
Dubaku is the only person With the names of the people who betrayed you Within your government. 
It's imperative that we find him. 
We would have to work under the radar. 
Any word of an investigation, People would start running for cover. 
You're saying we can't even involve The fbi and homeland? 
Yes, sir, that's correct. 
Madame president, Tim wohe says it's urgent. 
Put him through. 
Have a seat. 
Yes? 
Madame president, I'm sorry to interrupt. 
There's a call for you from ike dubaku. 
Voice i.d. confirms that. 
he says it's about your husband. 
My husband? 
Yes, ma'am. I'll connect you. 
This is president taylor. 
I'll come straight to the point, madame president. 
I have your husband. 
Let me demonstrate. 
Say something. 
Allison... 
Henry, are you all right? 
I'm fine. 
I'm sorry about this. 
For god sake, don't let them use me To influence you in any way. 
My demands are as follows: You will have your forces Withdrawn from around my country, Sangala, Immediately and permanently. 
Also, motobo must be delivered to my men Who will be stationed at the east lot Of the stanswick power plant. 
If he's not there by 4:00, Or if anybody attempts to follow or impede my men When they leave the plant, Your husband will die a slow and certain death. 
You wouldn't dare! 
Cut off his finger. 
Stop it! 
Stop it! 
Meet my demands Or I will send him back to you one piece at a time. 
Do you understand, madame president? 
Yes, I understand. 
Any attempt To find your husband Will be known to me very quickly, And I will kill him immediately. 
Madame president, I just heard back From the team I sent to henry's last-known location. 
They found samantha roth's And secret service agent gedge's bodies. 
Oh, god! 
Gedge had possession of a paralytic drug. 
That and other evidence on scene suggests he was complicit In henry's abduction, which, of course, confirms The corruption you just told us about. 
Madame president, time is tight. 
We need to decide how to respond. 
I don't think anyone would blame you For holding back, at least temporarily, The invasion of Sangala. 
How many people died on those planes? 
How many?! 
About 300, ma'am. 
All because I refused to change course in Sangala. 
How can I ask the american people to make sacrifices That I'm not willing to make myself? 
I can't give in. 
I can't. 
Madame president... 
We can still try and find your husband Before the 4:00 deadline. 
Dubaku has specifically forbidden that. 
And according to you, I can't trust any of my Law enforcement agencies. 
You can trust me. 
Right now everyone believes that agent walker is dead, And I have no status at all. 
Which means that dubaku's spies Cannot track us because officially, we don't exist. 
You resigned from government service, And the senate regards you as having been a renegade agent. 
How am I supposed to know where your loyalties really lie? 
With all due respect, madame president, ask around. 
What could you even do on such short notice? 
I couldn't make you any promises, But we will do everything possible to save your husband. 
Right now, we need you to go along With dubaku's demands. 
help buy us some time. 
Madame president, you don't have another choice. 
All right. 
All right. 
Find him, please? 
Yes, ma'am. 
We're gonna need a secure hard line. 
You may use this room if you need to. 
I'll have you escorted back out through The underground entrance when you're ready. 
I'm gonna need a copy of the president And the first gentleman's secret service details. 
I'll have them brought to you. 
Thank you. 
Okay, we'll start off with agent gedge. 
We need access to his phone records. 
I want to know who he's been talking to over the last few hours. 
Obviously, we can't use any of The president's security people. 
Thank you. 
Phone logs are highly classified, Especially for agents assigned to the first family. 
Can chloe o'brian get access? 
It'll be faster if we can get someone Who's already got clearance. 
Larry moss. 
He doesn't strike me As someone who's willing to work outside the system. 
That's true, but I think I can persuade him to do what we need. 
You really trust him? 
Yes. we know each other pretty well. 
Fine. try him. we don't have much time. 
Agent moss. 
Larry, it's renee. I'm alive, 
But you can't let anyone know. 
do you understand me? 
Oh, my god. 
Renee? what... where are you? are you all right? 
I'm-i'm fine. I'll explain later, 
But right now we need your help. 
Who's, who's "we"? 
Myself and jack bauer. 
What?! 
He's on our side, larry, just like he said. 
Everything that he did, he did to preserve his cover. 
Renee, this whole time I've been thinking you were dead. 
Why didn't you tell me? 
The bureau is compromised. 
Larry, just like he said, and on one there can know About this operation. 
it has to stay completely off book. 
What operation? 
Jack and I are at the white house. 
The first gentleman has been kidnapped by ike dubaku. 
I don't, I don't know anything about that. 
It's true. the president's asked 
jack and me to find him. 
Very few people know about this, And that's the way that it has to stay. 
If we don't find him by 4:00 p.m., he'll be killed. 
Larry... if you've ever trusted me, 
Trust me now, please, and help me. 
What do you want me to do? 
Looks like the first gentleman's secret service agent Was involved in all of this-- brian gedge; he's dead. 
You need to check his phone logs And get all the information you can About who he's been in contact with recently. 
I need to see you to make sure this is real, That you're not under duress. 
No, there's no time for that. 
That's not negotiable. 
you want my help, we meet. 
The capitol reflecting pool, as soon as you can get there. 
Okay, fine. 
HE'LL HELP US I THINK, BUT WE NEED TO GO. 
President taylor emphasized The terrorists are no longer a threat And says the invasion will begin. 
She also says Former prime minister ule motobo will be reinstated To work towards building a new democratic government. 
I don't get it. 
What? 
The president's talking as if The cip device and motobo have been recovered, But how could that have happened without us knowing about it? 
Well, it just means whatever agency's responsible Hasn't let us know. 
What other agency? 
We're being kept out of the loop, And I don't like it. 
So am I seeing you later? 
I don't know. I've got some things to figure out. 
What does that mean? 
It means I have to get home at some point. 
I haven't seen christina in a week. 
All right. 
Sean, are you all right? 
I'm fine. 
I'm sensing a little distance. 
I just have to get back to work. 
Excuse me. 
Could you be a little less obvious, do you think? 
What are you talking about? 
Give me a break. 
Just hold up a sign that says, "hey, world, we're sleeping together." 
Are you stupid? 
I know it's stupid and wrong, And I'm gonna end it. 
Yeah, you'd better, fast, before larry notices. 
Where is larry? 
I don't know. 
that's not the point. 
The point is, if he finds out about this, he's gonna transfer your ass to juneau so fast, Your head will spin. 
Larry. 
Oh, my god. 
I thought I'd never see you again. 
Were you able to access agent gedge's phone records? 
Yeah. 
Yeah, Over the last three hours, gedge spoke repeatedly To another secret service agent named edward vossler. 
I checked out vossler's personnel records. 
Before he was a secret service agent, he was special forces, And for two years, served in Sangala. 
So we can assume vossler's working for dubaku. 
Did you bring any of his files with you? 
Yeah. 
Does vossler have a family? 
Why do you need to know that? 
Does he have a family? 
He's been married for five years to a paralegal. 
They have an 11-month-old baby boy. 
She left her job to stay home with the kid. 
Okay, we're gonna need to split up. 
I need you to help me track vossler. 
I need you to go to his home and hope his family is there. 
Vossler was special forces. 
There's no way we're gonna break him in the time that we've got. 
The only way to get him to cooperate is to make him Think we're gonna hurt his family, his wife and his kid. 
No, absolutely not. 
renee? 
That's stepping over the line, jack. 
You stepped over the line The second you interrogated tanner. 
Tanner's a murderer. 
As far as we know, vossler's wife is completely innocent, Let alone a small child. 
When are you people gonna stop thinking Everyone else is following your rules?! 
They're not! 
Dubaku is gonna kill henry taylor Within the next 45 minutes unless we find him. 
YOU'VE GOT ONE OF TWO CHOICES. 
Now you can either phone the president and explain to her That your conscience won't allow you To do what is necessary to save him, Or you can simply do what is necessary. 
Pick one! 
Renee? 
Larry! 
Renee? 
I'm gonna need your vehicle. 
Start tracking vossler through his cell phone. 
Utilize his secret service deployment grid. 
Look at yourself. 
You've lost everyone and everything you ever had By doing what you think is necessary. 
I won't let you do it to her, bauer. 
Renee will not end up like you. 
Are you gonna give me your keys or not? 
Jack. 
Jack! 
The rules are what make us better. 
Not today. 
Even those who oppose the plan to invade Sangala Can't deny the atrocities committed by that regime. 
I slowed down taylor's bleeding, But I can't get it to stop completely. 
Tourniquet is as tight as possible? 
Yes. 
Then cauterize the wound. 
Mikali has a blowtorch. 
You risk taylor going into shock. 
Just put something in his mouth. 
I don't want him biting his tongue off with the pain. 
Hey, what are you doing at home, huh? 
I thought you'd be at work. 
I was. rosa called me at the diner. 
She was having one of her episodes. 
You know your sister. 
she's just manipulating you. 
You don't have to go to her every time she calls. 
I'm all she has, samuel. 
be kind. 
You know, you're kind enough for both of us. 
I just wanted to make sure That you were still coming to dinner tonight. 
Um, look, I'm really sorry, but I can't. 
I'm looking at a stack of shipping manifests. 
Oh, no! isn't there some way? 
We could do it as late as you want. 
I really wish I could. 
I'm sorry, marika. 
Uh, listen, baby, I'll make it up to you, okay? 
Okay. well, I'm gonna make extra 
Just in case you change your mind. 
You're too good to me. 
You're right. 
I have to get back to the diner, rosa. 
Are you gonna be okay? 
Who was that on the phone? 
It was him, wasn't it? 
All right, stop. 
I know you don't approve Of samuel, but I love him. 
Oh. you love him? 
Why? 
Because he spends money on you? 
Because he pays our rent? 
You've only known him Four months. 
What difference does that make? 
You don't know anything about him. 
What if he's not the importer he says he is? 
Or that he's in this country illegally? 
Not this again. 
I'm just trying to protect you, marika. 
I don't need your protection. 
Yes, you do. 
This man isn't... 
Isn't what? 
Nothing. 
Forget it. 
I'm sorry, I don't have time for this. 
I'll be home after my shift. 
We can appear to comply with the first part of dubaku's demand By pulling the fleet back. 
Then we simply launch the invasion from farther out at sea. 
Now, the second part of his demand is more complicated. 
If we were really turning matobo over, We'd be putting him in a car right about now. 
That's out of the question. we need him safe. 
Agreed. 
but we can send a car with a look-alike. 
If we handle it right, dubaku won't be aware of the deception Until the last minute. 
By then, hopefully, we'll have found henry. 
Madame president, do we have your authorization to proceed? 
Yes. 
This is bauer. 
Okay, I've got vossler. he's on the beltway 
Near bethesda, moving south, about seven miles from you. 
Copy that. I'm on my way. where's he headed? 
According to the secret service log, His shift starts at 4:00 p.m. 
He's meeting a foreign dignitary's plane at andrews. 
Jack, I don't have to tell you Once he's through that gate and onto that base, You're not going to be able to touch him. 
Okay, he's going to have to double back on the 337 If he wants to get through that main gate. 
I should be able to make up time by taking connecticut. 
Just keep sight of him. 
Have you heard from renee? 
Do we know if she's arrived at vossler's house yet? 
No. but she knows how to get in touch with us 
If she's in trouble. 
Coming. 
Can I help you? 
Who are you? 
Shut up. do what I tell you, and there's a chance 
You'll live through this. 
 Don't move! 
 he's scared. 
Stay where you are or I will shoot you where you stand. 
You're going to kill me for trying to comfort my baby? 
Sit down. 
What kind of a person are you? 
Doing this to us. 
You should ask your husband that. 
What are you talking about? 
Edward is a good man. 
Maybe you don't know him quite as well as you think you do. 
 I know he would never point a gun near a child. 
 shut up! 
Put the cuff around your wrist. 
Don't do this. 
Now! 
Okay, where is he now? 
He just got off the beltway. 
He's stopped in traffic. 
Okay, I'm coming up on the intersection Of allenford and auth. 
I should be there in 30 seconds. 
Just let me know if he moves. 
He's moving. 
Damn it! 
What's the next street north? 
Baxter drive. 
But, jack, it's a one-way street. 
Copy that. 
He made the light at allenford. 
I'm on baxter. 
He's 15 seconds away, jack. 
Ten seconds. 
Five seconds. 
I got him. 
Let me see your hands! 
Now! 
Get out of the car. get out of the car! 
Move. move! 
GET IN HERE! 
COME HERE! 
Where is he? 
 Where is henry taylor? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
Where is he? 
Fine, We'll do this your way Yes. 
I've got vossler. you got his wife? 
 And his child. 
 you ready? 
Yes. 
Put your phone on speaker. 
Talk to your wife. 
 You son of a bitch... 
 talk to your wife! 
Carol, ar-are you all right? 
There's a woman with a gun. 
she's threatening to kill me. 
Why is conner crying? 
Oh, my god, edward. 
What's happening? who are these people? 
You are running out of time. 
I didn't want to have to do this. 
No, you wouldn't... 
 What's happening? 
 I don't know. she's got conner. 
Oh, my god, she's doing something to conner! 
Let go of my baby! 
He's just a baby! please! 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 you can stop this. just tell me where he is. 
For god's sake, edward, tell them what they want to know! 
Damn it! all right, all right, I'll tell you! 
Stand down. I'll get back to you. 
Your baby's fine. 
You're a monster! 
Where is he?! 
You tell me now, or the situation For your family goes from bad to worse. 
Where is he? 
How do I know you're just not going to kill them anyway? 
You don't. 
Fine. 
There's a greengrocer, 12451 arlington avenue. 
They're holding him in the basement. 
Access. 
There's a staircase in the back, But it's always locked. 
 Is dubaku with him? 
 he was. 
How many guns are guarding him? 
 At least four. 
 get out of here! 
Get away from the car! 
Walk away... now! 
Damn it. 
Stop! 
Get out of the car now! 
Move! move! 
The goal is to make it look like we're going to hand matobo over For as long as is reasonably possible. 
When you get to the rendezvous point, Keep your distance from dubaku's men. 
Let them see you in the backseat, But do not get out of the car. 
Don't let them get any closer than you feel comfortable with. 
As soon as you start to feel that the risk is unacceptable, Get the hell out. 
That's straight from the president. 
 Clear? 
 clear. 
Good luck. 
Jack? 
I got an address For henry taylor. 
12451 arlington avenue. 
It's a storefront. 
he's being held in the basement. 
If you get there before I do, I want you to stand down. 
Dubaku's got at least four gunmen there. 
 All right. 
 meanwhile, I'm going to call bill, Pull him up to speed. 
I want you to do the same thing with larry. 
 And what about vossler? 
 he's dead. 
He attacked me. I didn't have a choice. 
Are you okay? 
No, I don't think I am. 
What do you mean? what's wrong? 
Agent walker, are you still there? 
I'm not... 
Listen to me. 
We could not have gotten this far if it wasn't for you. 
Okay? 
No one would blame you if this was just too much for you to handle. 
Maybe you should get out. 
Maybe I will. 
Yeah. 
Tomorrow. 
Agent masden and I are on our way. 
We'll be tracking you via satellite. 
Check in with me when you're approaching the power plant. 
Yes, sir. 
How much time do you think this will buy us? 
Until dubaku realizes matobo's not in the limo. 
Ten minutes, maybe 15. 
That's 15 minutes more than we had. 
Madame president, I just got off the phone with jack bauer. 
He and agent walker think they have a location on your husband. 
Where? 
Arlington avenue. 
they're on their way now. 
How long will it take them? 
Ten, 15 minutes. 
Thank you. 
This just came over from homeland. 
Like you said We're being kept out of the loop. 
Thanks. 
Did you see this? 
Homeland's preparing to lower the threat level At the president's request. 
Yeah, I saw the flash. 
Don't you think that's odd, Considering we don't know anything about the cip device being recovered? 
Yeah. I'll talk to homeland. 
All I'm saying is... I get the feeling 
Like there's something going on behind our back here. 
Like I said, I'll talk to them. 
 Excuse me. 
 yeah, sure. 
Where are you? 
On my way to where we think henry taylor's being held. 
So you got vossler to talk. 
It gave us our only chance to rescue the president's husband. 
What's the address? 
I'll send a swat team to meet you. 
You know you can't do that. 
The bureau's compromised. 
It will jeopardize any attempt that we make. 
But there is something else I need you to do. 
Okay, what's that? 
Keep an incident quiet Until what jack and I are doing goes down. 
What incident? 
Vossler's dead. 
Jack killed him at the hotel on 18th and riggin. 
It was self-defense. 
Is that what he told you? 
 Larry... 
 damn it, renee, what the hell are you doing with this guy? 
We're supposed to bring suspects in, not murder them. 
Larry, please... 
And until we know who dubaku's source is there, You've got to handle this outside of the bureau, okay? 
There's a guy at d.c. metro I know I can trust. 
I'll have him deal with vossler. 
Thank you, larry. 
I understand. I will let him know. 
According to our sources, a vehicle containing matobo  Just left the white house. 
 good. 
What is the state of the american invasion forces? 
The fleet is withdrawing From Sangalan territorial waters, And has set steam for the 23rd meridian. 
Excellent. 
Hello. 
It's rosa. 
Rosa, if you're looking for marika, she's not with me. 
I'm looking for you, samuel. 
Or whatever your real name is. 
What are you talking about? 
My sister may be naive, but I'm not. 
I checked with someone I know at immigration services, And no one named samuel aboa emigrated from Sangala In the last year, or in the last 15 years. 
Well, they've obviously made a mistake. 
You're making a mistake. 
Now I don't know who you really are, and I don't care. 
I just want you out of my sister's life. 
Does marika know about this? 
No, not yet. 
And I'm willing to keep it that way. 
So you've not reported me to anyone? 
No. I don't want marika to know anything about this. 
What do you want? 
Break up with her, And this stays between us. 
You just end it tonight, And we won't have a problem. 
I have to take care of a little problem. 
CALL ME WHEN WE HAVE MATOBO. 
Yeah. 
The vehicle that's supposed to be delivering matobo Is arriving at the power plant. 
if we delay any longer, Dubaku is going to get suspicious. 
what's your status? 
 I'm almost there. how much time can you buy us? 
 I don't know, jack. 
Okay, agent walker and I will move in as soon as I get there. 
I'll keep you posted. 
All right, good luck. 
This is agent smith. 
 We've got a visual on dubaku's men. 
 understood. 
We have it on satellite. 
Bring him to us. 
They've ordered us to get out of the car. 
 Now one of them is making a call. 
 hang tight, agent. 
Their car arrived,  But nothing is happening. 
 what do you mean nothing is happening? 
We ordered them to hand matobo over to us But no one's getting out of the vehicle. 
The americans have been playing us. 
Destroy their vehicle. 
Yes, sir. 
 That's long enough. 
get them the hell out of there. 
 retreat. 
 Get out now. 
 roger that. 
 You ready? 
 yes. 
Let's go. 
Get out from behind the counter. 
now! move! 
Okay, I want you to unlock that door. 
And I want you to ask those men what they want to eat. 
You do one thing I don't like, And I will blow your head off, you understand me? 
Open the door. 
Want anything to eat? 
 No. some cold beers. 
 okay. 
Yes. 
Kill henry taylor. 
Then we have nothing to hold over their heads. 
We don't have anything now. 
The president was willing to let him die. 
We are done here. 
Kill taylor, And have your men pack everything up. 
Understood. 
Oh, my god. 
Sir... sir... 
We're going to get you help. 
Just stay with me. 
Get an ambulance! 
TheJustice Department is investigating theJonas Hodges car bombing. 
I changed my mind. 
I didn't transfer the funds. 
Why would he go ahead and kill Hodges if he wasn't paid? 
Because it's what you wanted. Am I right? 
Jack, I unlocked Tony's location data. 
Okay, we've got him. 
Where's the canister? 
I am not gonna stop until you tell me where it is. 
 Jack. 
 It's all right. It's all right. 
 You need to give yourself a shot. 
 I already did, 20 minutes ago. 
 It's not working. 
 You heading home? 
 Yeah. 
 Us too. 
 This is Bauer. 
 I'm sending a link to your phone. 
It's something I think you should see. 
Your daughter's in the company of our operatives. 
Put this call on your earpiece and keep the line open. 
I'm gonna be listening to everything you say. 
You will help Tony Almeida escape, or my people will murder your daughter. 
 The following takes place between 6:00 a.m. And 7:00 a.m. 
Okay. Thank you. 
The Deputy Attorney General is ready for you, ma'am. 
TelePresence call is initiated. 
Network is secure. Go ahead. 
Good morning, Ms. Taylor. Thank you for 
giving up your time for this investigation. 
Of course. 
Mrs. Rollins, Mr. Hock 
are from theJustice Department. 
They'll be conducting your interview. 
Let the record show that this is to be the testimony of Olivia Taylor... 
acting White House chief of staff... 
regarding the homicide of federal witness Jonas Hodges. 
Let it also show that I am present to ensure that strict protocols be followed... 
for Ms. Taylor's protection. 
 Why would I need protecting? 
 Uh, poor choice of words. 
I merely meant that your questioning is just a formality. 
We have to go through everyone who had knowledge of Hodges's whereabouts until the bombing. 
I see. 
Mrs. Rollins, 
you have the floor. Let's begin. 
I wanted Olivia in this briefing. 
Where is she? 
I'm sorry, ma'am, but she's tied up with the Deputy A.G. And investigators... 
Iooking into the Hodges murder. 
 Have they made any progress on who leaked Hodges's location? 
 Not yet. 
But they agree that the list of people who knew Hodges was alive and at F.B.I. Is short. 
The leak had to come from inside. 
 Good morning, everyone. 
 Good morning, Madam President. 
 Madam President. 
 Please take your seats. 
I realize that we are all in dire need of sleep... 
but I felt that it was vital... 
to bring you all up to speed on the events of the past few hours... 
and a greater crisis we face on the horizon. 
Less than 30 minutes ago, the F.B.I. Managed to recover... 
the last canister of the bioweapon. 
But I'm afraid that the danger is far from over. 
Before his death, Jonas Hodges told us... 
that there were other parties involved with him in the creation of this bioweapon a highly secret and extremely powerful group of private military firms... 
collaborating to undermine the government of this country. 
Excuse me, Madam President... 
but which military firms are we talking about? 
We don't know, Admiral. 
Hodges gave us no names or idea of which companies are involved... 
but whoever they are, they represent a very real and ongoing threat. 
Now, we don't have much actionable intelligence at this point. 
However, the F.B.I. Has apprehended 
former C.T.U. Operative Tony Almeida. 
He is a key figure in this plot... 
someone we hope will be able to help us uncover who these people are. 
Agent Walker, this is air support Bravo 3. 
 We're in position. Your convoy's in sight. 
 Roger that, Bravo 3. 
Metro will be controlling traffic and setting up a secure corridor through downtown. 
We'll be bringing Almeida in to headquarters through the west entrance. 
It's almost time, Mr. Bauer. 
The convoy you're traveling with is about to get off on the l-70. 
You'll need to break off before you reach the downtown exit... 
or you'll lose your chance to facilitate an escape for Tony. 
For your daughter's sake... 
you don't want that to happen. 
Now listen carefully. 
You'll need to commandeer the van... 
and peel onto the Taft Street exit in about four miles. 
I'll direct you further once you've managed this. 
Remember, my operatives are with your daughter. 
In fact, I'm looking at her right now, so don't try to be a hero. 
Something wrong? 
It's starting to look like the flight is gonna be full. And I'm on standby. 
Oh, no, you're gonna get on. There have to be 
some people that are too spooked to fly... 
after those planes went down yesterday. 
Bob, did you have to bring that up? 
I'm just saying! Look, I think it makes us safer. 
They're gonna take extra precautions. 
Excuse me. A re those yours? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 Would you mind, so my mother could sit down, please? 
Oh. Sure. 
 Oh! You're bleeding. 
 What? 
 You have a scratch on your neck. 
 Honey! 
That must have happened when the door hit you getting out of the cab. 
Oh, well, y- I'll just go to the newsstand and see if they have some Band-Aids. 
 What is it? 
 I'm getting worried. 
It's only a matter of time before that F.B.I. Agent's body's discovered... 
and I think Bauer's daughter is getting suspicious. 
Look, I gave Bauer a short window to deliver Tony to me. 
It won't be long. 
Just stand by until you hear from me. 
And what if Kim Bauer makes us before then? 
You can't allow yourselves to be taken. 
Do what you have to do. 
Agent Walker, let me see your comm unit. 
I want to adjust its frequency. 
It's interrupting mine. Thanks. 
 Don't move. Don't move! 
 Jack. 
Just keep driving and no one gets hurt. 
Both of you, I want you to slowly draw your weapons... 
 put them on the floor and slide them to me. 
 Jack Do it! 
Don't make this harder than it already is. 
Give me your weapon, or I will kill him. 
Come on, Jack. 
You're not gonna kill anyone. 
   Give me your weapon! Now! 
Driver, I want you to handcuff yourself to the steering wheel. Over and under. Do it now. 
You're gonna exit the freeway when I tell you. 
Until then, I want you to maintain speed. 
 Now! 
  Agent Walker, what's happening? 
Agent Walker! 
 Comm, the prisoner transport has split from the convoy. 
Renee, it's Janis. Do you read me? Renee! 
 Are you reading me? 
Agent Walker, what's your 20? 
Agent Walker, please respond. 
 Jack, why? 
 They've got my daughter. 
That's not possible. I deployed Agent Franks 
to watch over her like you asked. 
Agent Franks is dead. The people that are working 
with Tony have operatives with Kim right now. 
 Jack. 
 They've threatened to kill her if I don't break him out. 
 Jack, that's enough! 
 You son of a bitch. 
 Okay. We're on Taft. What now? 
 You'll see the entrance to the Connecticut Avenue tunnel. 
 Take the north lane. 
 Continue down this street. 
Go towards the tunnel, north. 
 Aerial Bravo 3, do you still have a visual? 
 Affirmative. 
The follow vehicles in the convoy... 
are getting off at the next exit and will be doubling back. 
I've got prisoner transport on satellite. 
They're heading west on Hudson. 
Wait. They're pulling into 
the Connecticut Avenue tunnel. 
I'm losing visual. 
Repeat: I am losing visual. 
 Pull up the transponder locators. 
 Yep. 
Okay, we're in the tunnel. 
 You'll see me parked in the emergency lane about a quarter mile in. 
I want you to pull behind that S.U.V. 
Jack, please. I understand your reasons, 
but you can't do this. 
No, what I can't do is risk Kim's life. 
UncuffTony. 
Give me the keys. 
You cuff her. I'll take him. 
They have a camera on Kim. 
I don't trust Tony to let her go. 
Please, I am begging you, do whatever you have to to save her. Please. 
Jack. 
The gun. 
Cuff yourself. 
Come on. 
What are you bringing Bauer for? 
Tony, I've done everything you've asked. 
Just let Kim go. 
 Let her go! 
 Get in the car. 
So what are you doing, Tony? 
We don't need a hostage, okay, especially not him. 
Shoot him already, and let's get out of here. 
You're not seeing the big picture, Cara. 
Your people are gonna be able... 
to launch their biological attacks just as they originally planned. 
How? We lost the canister. 
We don't have the pathogen anymore. 
We haveJack. 
The pathogen's in his blood. 
It's in his organs. 
We'll be able to harvest everything we need from his body. 
Why do you think I had you put those operatives on Kim Bauer? 
Your people are still gonna need proof thatJack's viable. 
Have one of your biochemists meet us at the complex. 
Let's begin with the confidential document on the left hand side of the packet. 
Take a moment to look that over. 
 Thank you again for coming. 
 You can thank me, Agent Pierce... 
by telling me what this is all about. 
All right, sir, but we don't have much time. 
 You implied it had something to do with Olivia Taylor. 
 Yes, sir. 
A few hours ago, Jonas Hodges was killed outside F.B.I. Headquarters. 
My God. 
Now, authorities believe he was murdered to keep him from implicating others... 
who were involved in the bioweapon attacks... 
but I suspect there may be another scenario... 
and I have reason to believe that Ms. Taylor might be involved. 
That is an outrageous accusation, Agent Pierce. 
Olivia is capable of many things... 
but I can't believe committing murder is one of them. 
Mr. Kanin, please just hear me out. 
After the president agreed to a witness protection deal for Hodges... 
Ms. Taylor made a comment to me... 
about wanting to see Hodges dead. 
He was responsible for her brother's death. 
She was venting. 
I thought so too... 
until she met in her office with an old colleague of hers, a man named Martin Collier. 
 I know Collier. 
 Then you know the sort of man he is. 
I do, but none of this constitutes proof of complicity. 
No, sir. That's why I need you to access 
the digital recording system to see if their conversation was recorded. 
Agent, you're asking me to break into an office that's no longer mine... 
and access classified recordings of the acting chief of staff. 
Mr. Kanin, if my suspicions 
prove correct... 
you, of all people, understand how grave these consequences would be. 
Sir, Ms. Taylor's behavior over the past 
several hours has been erratic at best. 
Now, she's with theJustice Department investigators now, and we don't have much time. 
Sir, I need you... 
to decide if you're gonna help me. 
If you could just again review the records on the screen below, Ms. Taylor... 
I want to confirm that during the timeline in question you had no outside contact... 
other than what's reflected in the phone and Internet logs you uploaded to us. 
For the third time, that's correct. 
We're just trying to be thorough, ma'am. 
I think we've taken up enough of your valuable time, Ms. Taylor. 
Thank you for, uh, indulging us. 
You're welcome. Good luck 
with the rest of the investigation. 
She's coming. 
Sir. 
She's on her way. 
Ms. Taylor, I tried to get word to you 
but was told you were not to be disturbed. 
Word to me about what? 
 Let me explain. 
  Good morning, Olivia. 
Ethan. 
What are you doing here? 
I'd forgotten some files when I cleared out my office, so... 
Secret Service was kind enough to admit me so I could retrieve them. 
May I see them? 
Nothing terribly important. 
But I like to fully archive my memos for, uh, posterity. 
You understand. 
So you have what you came for. 
Um, I think so. 
Well, then if you'll excuse me Of course. 
Agent Pierce. 
Stay a moment, please. 
 What was he doing here? 
 Ma'am? 
Kanin. Did you observe him 
while he was in my office? 
Is something wrong, ma'am? 
Yes. Yes, something is wrong. 
No one, and I mean no one is to be allowed in my office without Ms. Taylor, could I get someone 
on staff to help you with that? 
 Ms. Taylor 
 Security? 
This is Olivia Taylor. 
Ethan Kanin is on his way out of the White House. I want him taken into custody. 
Detain him until I arrive. 
Ma'am, what's happened? 
He stole my property, Aaron. 
Sir. 
Mr. Kanin! Mr. Kanin! 
 Yes? 
 We have orders to detain you, sir. 
Orders from whom? 
From the acting chief of staff, sir. 
Please come with us. 
Sir. 
Command, this is Walker. 
Janis, do you read me? 
 I'm here. Are you all right? 
 Yeah. 
 What is happening? 
 Jack commandeered the transport. 
He was forced into helping Tony escape. 
Renee, it's Chloe. 
What do you mean, "forced'"? 
The group Almeida's working for threatened to kill Kim Bauer if he didn't cooperate. 
They have Kim? 
According toJack, they have operatives with her at the airport... 
but I don't think she's aware of that. 
 Do you want me to contact airport P.D. 
 No. 
We can't move on these people until we know who they are. 
Chloe, I need you to patch me in directly to Kim's departure gate. 
 She's at Gate 7. 
 I'm on it. 
 I'll brief the White House and let them know what's happened. 
 I'll call when I'm on my way. 
I have a priority one emergency call from F.B.I. 
Please connect me with an agent at Gate 7. 
for Flight 147, nonstop to Los Angeles. 
Maintenance crews have finished preparing the aircraft... 
and we should be ready to begin boarding in approximately 10 minutes. 
Thank you again for your patience. 
Would the following standby ticket holders please report to the ticket agent counter Marissa Boily, Kim Bauer, Robert Leighton. 
 Well, looks like I got on the flight. 
 Told you you would. 
and pending for Indianapolis... 
we do apologize for the delay at this time. 
     Kim Bauer? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll take you over here. 
 Okay. 
Phone call for you. 
Hello? 
Kim, this is Renee Walker. Listen carefully. 
Try not to react and do not look around. 
You're in danger. You're being watched 
by operatives sent by Tony Almeida. 
Tony? I don't understand. 
He's involved with the people responsible for the attacks. 
We had him in custody, but he used you as leverage... 
to force your father to break him out. 
I don't believe that Tony would do something like that. 
He's on the run, Kim. He's taken your father 
hostage. You've got to trust me on this. 
I'm on my way with a team to you now, but we have to I.D. The people who are watching you. 
They're our only lead to finding your father and Tony. 
There was a man that was staring at me earlier... 
but I haven't seen him in a while. 
 Describe him. 
 He was Hispanic. 
Medium build. He had short brown hair. 
He was wearing a suit. 
That was Agent Franks. 
Your father had me deploy him to the airport... 
to make sure you got on the plane safely. 
He was killed by the people following you. Listen, Kim. 
Whoever these operatives are, they're in close proximity to you. 
Your father told me they sent him a live feed to prove they had you in their sights. 
Have you noticed anyone with a camera or cell phone? 
 Or a laptop? 
 What? 
There's a couple that I've been talking to. 
They're sitting right next to me. 
The man has an open laptop right in front of me. 
 Can you give me a description? 
 Yeah. He's got long hair, he's tall 
 Kim? Kim, what's wrong? 
 Oh, well, I appreciate that. Okay. Thank you. 
Please let baggage claim know that I will be much more careful next time. 
Kim? 
 Chloe, do you read me? 
 I'm here. 
The operatives may be moving on Kim. A lert 
airport police. Have them lock down the terminal. 
Tell airport security to maintain patrols. 
Do nothing to arouse suspicion. 
Okay. 
Okay. Bye. 
We saw you were on the phone. We thought 
there might be a problem. You need some help? 
No. There's no problem. 
I left my electric toothbrush on in my luggage. 
So the airline called and said they broke my lock. 
 Nice. You get your boarding pass? 
 Oh, yeah. It's right here. 
There was a little security problem with her luggage. 
Guess they can never be too careful. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. 
This is the first time that I've been apart from my little girl. 
I'm just a little anxious to get back to see her. 
 Would you like to see a picture of her? 
 Sure. 
Got one in here. 
Here it is. 
Yeah. 
Where is... Here. Yeah. 
 Her name's Teri. 
 She's adorable. 
Thank you. 
Look at this. So cute. 
That's my husband, actually. 
This is-Aww. 
Take her. 
 Let me go! 
  Code two! Code two! 
Suspects are armed! 
Get down! 
Walker. 
It's Kim Bauer. Security's down. 
Where are the airport police? 
They're mobilizing to you now. 
What about the operatives? 
The woman is dead. 
The man is getting away. 
Kim, we need him to find your father. 
 What direction was he headed? 
   Agent Walker! 
   Damn it! 
 Kim? Kim! 
Let's go! Let's go! 
Olivia. 
I always liked that about you, Ethan. 
Even when I was a little girl, you always stood up when I came into the room. 
Old habits die hard. 
You removed something from my office. 
 I want it back. 
 I told you before, you're welcome to them. 
 You know damn well I'm not talking about those files. 
 Do I? 
Ethan, I found the digital recorder. 
Now give me what you took... 
or I'll order the security officers outside this door to strip-search you. 
All right. I do have a recording. 
It's a personal account of my last days in service to this administration... 
and I think I'm entitled to it. 
No one is entitled to take sensitive material out of the White House. 
Oh... 
now it's national security you're worried about. 
As a matter of fact, yes. 
Well, I still have my clearances. 
Why don't we listen to the recording together? 
You're in no position to dictate terms, Ethan. 
You're in violation of at least 10 federal laws. 
What are you so afraid of, Olivia? 
What's on there that's so incriminating? 
I'm not the one facing incrimination. 
You are. 
But give me the recording right now... 
and I'll see to it no charges are filed. 
Last chance, Ethan. 
Search him for a data card. 
I'm being held without cause. 
I demand to speak to President Taylor. 
It was the president who ordered his detention. 
If that's true, I want to hear it from her directly. 
Well, this is a criminal matter now. 
Considering her personal relationship with Mr. Kanin... 
the president doesn't deem it appropriate to intrude on the investigation. 
Please stand up, Mr. Kanin. 
Arms up. 
You're making a terrible mistake. 
Ms. Taylor is grossly 
overstepping her authority. 
Thank you, Agent. 
 Process him out. 
 Come with me, Mr. Kanin. 
I don't think you understand the seriousness of what you're doing. 
I don't think you do. 
Agent Hobson. 
I can take him the rest of the way. 
Fine. 
She's definitely hiding something, Agent Pierce. 
Lucky for us, I'm a paranoid son of a bitch. 
May I ask what was on the other data card? 
Nothing. It's blank. 
I can try to get you into the communications office so you can listen to that. 
Too risky. And unnecessary. I have 
a companion device to the recorder in my car. 
Well, it sounds like you were, uh, expecting this. 
One has to be prepared when you're dealing with Olivia. 
I'll let you know what I find. 
What are you doing? 
What are you doing? 
We're gonna use you to reconstitute the bioweapon, Jack. 
Put him on the table, face down. 
How long till we know? 
 It depends. 
 On what? 
On the levels of pathogen in his spinal fluid. 
 Give me a time frame. 
 Fifteen minutes. 
Good. Get started. 
Tony. Tony! 
 To  We've gotta give him something to control the seizure. 
I need him completely immobilized. 
There we go. 
I'll contact the group as soon as we know if Bauer's viable. 
 Yeah. Look, I need to talk to you first. 
 What is it? 
I want a larger role in the organization, and I think this is a good time to make my case. 
Tony, we've gone over this before. Okay? 
It's not how it works. 
You don't ask in. 
 You're invited in. 
 All right, then get me an invitation. 
Look, after what I've done today, I think I've earned it. 
You have been resourceful, it's true. 
 Still  Look. 
I know you talk to the top guy. 
All's I'm asking is that you get us in the same room together. I'll sell myself. 
 I don't think that would be the right approach. 
 Why not? 
Because he's careful to a fault, Tony... 
and he's very protective of his anonymity. 
I can appreciate that. 
But the bottom line is, without me this operation never happens. 
Now, you have influence over him. 
He trusts you. You can convince him. 
I've seen you do it before. 
 This is different. 
 That's right. 
It is different. 
This time it's for me. 
I'm ready to extract the spinal fluid. 
 Hold his head still. 
 All right. 
 He knows, Martin. I'm telling you. 
 No, Olivia, he doesn't. 
Worst case, he has a suspicion. 
He never actually had the time to listen to the recording, did he? 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 And he never will, because you destroyed the data card, right? 
 Of course. 
Then we're fine, all right, so long as you keep thinking clearly and don't panic. 
You're forgetting, I ended this man's career, Martin. 
He won't let me off the hook. Ever. 
You're the president's daughter, okay? Trust me. 
No one will come after you without hard evidence, least of all Ethan Kanin. 
 Olivia. 
 I've gotta go. 
President's been looking for you. 
She needs you in the Oval Office. 
 What's going on? 
 A situation unfolding at the airport involving Tony Almeida. 
 We're about to be briefed, and she wants you in on it. 
 Okay. 
Everything all right? 
Yes. Fine. 
We need help over here! 
Stand back. 
 Did you see which way he went? 
 It was chaos. 
There were people running everywhere  Janis, it's Renee. 
 Go ahead. 
The male operative remains at large. 
Kim Bauer is missing. 
Either she went after him or she's a hostage. 
Issue a priority alert across all channels. 
 Yep, that's it. 
 We got it. We're on our way back up. 
Officer, my name is Kim Bauer. 
I followed the man that shot up the terminal. 
You need to contact Special Agent Renee Walker with the F.B.I. 
Kim Bauer. 
 Kim, it's Renee. Go ahead. 
 I've got him. He's in the south parking garage. 
 Are you in visual contact? 
 No. He's on one of the upper levels. 
I'm at the exit. 
 Copy that. We're coming towards you. 
 Hurry! 
Hang on. Help is on the way. 
Oh, God. 
No! 
 Move! Move! Move! 
  Go! Go! Go! 
   Kim! 
You're hurt. Let me see your arm. 
No, listen to me, Renee. That laptop 
has the camera they were using to track me. 
With a D-11 inverse router... 
we may be able to backtrace the signal to the people that have my father. 
I worked at C.T.U. Systems analyst. 
Is there anyone back at your office that can help us with this? 
 Yeah. I've got Chloe O'Brian standing by. 
 Get her on the phone. 
 Once this happens, once it goes through, you can never go back. 
You will live with it for the rest of your life. 
 I don't need a lecture on conscience from you, of all people. 
I have thought this through. 
What I can't live with is that monster getting away with this. 
He has to pay for what he did. 
The virus load is even higher than we hoped for. 
Ten-plus in spinal fluid alone. 
Not enough to reconstitute the pathogen, of course. 
We'll still need his organs for that. 
He doesn't look too good. 
How much longer does he have? 
Couple of hours, give or take. 
And what happens if he dies before we extract the pathogen? 
Obviously, it's optimal to keep the host alive... 
but the pathogen can survive up to two hours after death, sometimes even longer. 
In fact, the only sure way to destroy it... 
is by exposure to extreme temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius. 
Make sure you put that in your report. 
I have. And I've already 
uploaded it to your computer. 
Good. Get him ready to move. 
Get the stretcher. 
Bauer is viable, but you'll need to secure a facility. 
That won't be a problem as long as you're absolutely certain that we can accomplish this. 
We've already done the hard part, Alan. 
And from what I understand, with the proper equipment... 
the actual extraction and bioengineering is fairly straightforward. 
Okay, Cara. 
I'll contact the others. Good work. 
They should know they have Almeida to thank for this. 
 He's the one who realized Bauer was a possible source. 
 Relay my gratitude. 
I think you should consider going farther than that. 
"Farther"? What did you have in mind? 
Tony believes in what we're doing. 
He wants to play a larger role. 
That sounds premature to me. 
The thing is, Alan, if we don't make a significant gesture... 
I'm afraid we may lose him. 
I don't even know this man, Cara. 
Then you should get to know him. 
Are you suggesting I meet with him? 
Look, all I'm saying is that he would be a very useful voice in the mix. 
His field experience fills a knowledge gap in regards to our logistics and planning. 
Coming from you, that's a hell of a recommendation. 
There's no one better, Alan. 
And it's not as if you haven't vetted every other member of the group. 
Maybe it is time that he and I met. 
I could be there, where you are, in the next half hour. 
You're coming here? 
I think it would be a good idea if I supervised Bauer's transfer myself... 
Make the others feel at ease, don't you think? 
But, Cara, I'll look Almeida in the eye... 
and if for any reason I don't like what I see You understand. 
I can't let him walk out of that meeting alive. 
I understand. 
He wants to meet you. 
He'll be here in a little while. 
Thank you. 
It's up to you now. 
Wheel the gurney closer. 
Get that. 
Son of a bitch. 
He's gone! Come on! 
He's too weak to have gotten very far. 
Cover the north exit. I'll go this way. 
Agent Walker told me that there's a chance a small chance that I could help you. 
I'm dying, and whatever small chance there is to stop that from happening... 
it is not worth the pain... 
for me to let you sit there and watch me die. 
Daddy, I don't wanna lose you. 
 Come here. 
 I don't. 
   What is it? 
Sweetheart, I'm sorry. But you need to go. 
Hodges was behind everything that happened today, from the planes going down... 
 to the attack on the White House. 
 What? 
He's also responsible for the death of my brother. 
All you need to know is Hodges worked a deal. 
Witness protection. 
My mother approved it, and he's going free. 
Unless someone intervenes. 
I'll get you contact information, a price... 
and instructions on how to transfer the funds. 
Martin, it's Olivia Taylor. 
I spoke to the contact, but I couldn't go through with it. 
Listen to me, Jibraan. 
If you don't do exactly as I say... 
you're gonna watch your younger brother die right in front of your eyes. 
And then, I'm gonna kill you. Hmm? 
It was the Americans who killed our parents, Hamid. 
 I'm going to make them pay. 
 What have you done to my brother? 
You've poisoned his mind. This isn't my brother. 
We're looking for a man who worships here. 
His name is Jibraan Al-Zarian. 
Do you know him? 
I know him, but he is not a terrorist. 
We did not come here to debate this with you! 
Where does he live? 
You come into a house of worship with information you should not have... 
an outrageous accusation, no legal warrant and threaten me. 
 I have not threatened you. 
 Not yet. 
But we both know where this is going. 
Jack, it's Chloe. I found something weird 
about these hits on Jibraan Al-Zarian. 
You know how I said the two million dollars... 
was deposited into his account over a period of six months? 
That wasn't right. They were backdated. 
What about the extremist Web sites he was visiting? 
Same thing with the time stamps. 
The hits were backdated 30 minutes ago. 
Jibraan could be innocent. 
 What do you have, Agent? 
 Armed hostile in the back room, holding a hostage. 
 What about Almeida? 
 He's not in there. See for yourself. 
  Is that who you're looking for? 
 No. 
It's Jibraan's brother, Hamid. 
They're using him as leverage to makeJibraan do what they want. 
 How can you be sure? 
 That's what I would have done. 
 Hamid, stop! 
  Put it down. 
We're F.B.I. We need him alive. 
 The following takes place between 5:00 a.m. And 6:00 a.m. 
 The canister's being retrofitted to maximize dispersion. 
We're on target to release the bioweapon... 
at Washington Central Station within the hour. 
 Your casualty estimates are holding up? 
 I think they're conservative. 
A significant portion of the pathogen... 
will escape into the station's ventilation system... 
which will circulate it for us. 
Between 8,000 and 10,000 commuters will be exposed. 
Tell me about Mr. A l-Zarian. 
Is he compliant? 
Yes. His primary concern at 
this point is for the safety of his brother. 
And what's his level of awareness regarding the plan? 
He won't know anything about the canister until it's too late. 
 Good. We'll talk once it's done. 
      Trigger mechanism's working. 
This device will tell me where you are at all times. 
   It'll also allow us to talk to each other. 
Talk about what? 
You still haven't told me what you want me to do. 
Right now I just want you to get on the subway... 
and take the Red Line all the way to Washington Center. 
 And when I get there? 
 I'll let you know then. 
I'm not stupid. 
I know you are going to blame me for something. 
 Jibraan  What's your plan, huh? 
You are going to hurt people? 
Jibraan, the only person you need to worry about right now... 
is your brother. 
You follow my instructions, and Hamid lives. 
You do something stupid, and he dies- badly. 
Understood? Good. 
Red Line, westbound, to Washington Center. Got it? 
Let's go. Come on. 
Sorry this had to happen like this. 
We will find your brother. 
  How you doin'back there? 
 You should talk to him. 
Kid doesn't know anything... 
except that his brother was taken by Tony about a half an hour ago. 
He didn't overhear anything about a target or the time frame. 
Right now, he's our only lead. 
He's badly injured. I don't know 
if he's in any condition to talk. 
 Oh, God! 
 Hold his head. I'm gonna 
give him some morphine. 
No, you're not. 
His wound is in the middle of a nerve cluster. 
 He can go into shock from the pain. 
 I know. 
Back off. 
You should step out of the room. 
Do what you need to do. 
 Where's Almeida? 
 Please, just give me the morphine. 
I'll give you the morphine as soon as you talk. Where's Tony Almeida? 
 What's the target? 
 I don't know. 
God! 
 What's the target? 
 I don't know! I'm telling you the truth. 
My job was just to watch the kid and monitor things here. 
Almeida didn't tell me where he was going or where the target is. 
How'd he contact you? 
I can't. 
Okay, okay. 
I have a number. 
But I'm not supposed to use it unless there's a problem. 
You better start thinkin' of one fast. 
 Where's his phone? 
 I have it here. 
Give him enough morphine so that he can take the pain out of his voice. 
 Nothing more. 
  I want you to get Chloe to run a trace on this number. 
 Tell her to feed it back to our cell phones. 
  You better start thinkin' about what you're gonna say. 
You try and screw with me on this It'll be the last thing you ever do. 
You understand me? 
 Do you understand me? 
 Yes. 
   Janis Gold. 
It's Renee. I need Chloe to run 
a peer-to-peer cellular trace... 
 from a G.S.M. I.D. 
 I can do that. 
Jack asked for Chloe to run point on this. 
What's the number? 
 AlphaCharlie3316. 
 Got it. 
 I'll need you to run it back through to me and Jack. 
 Hold on. 
 She's working on it. 
 Good. 
I'll open up the locate protocol. You establish a secure V.P.N. 
 All right, opening a channel on the intersatellite  Why would you do that? 
 What? 
 You know, connecting... 
through a D.M.A. Node 
would be a lot faster. 
No, I don't know it's quicker to use a D.M.A. 
Node, or else I would have done just that. 
 I had no idea the D.M.A. Nodes 
were up and running. 
 Really? 
Because they've been up and running for about two years. 
It's obvious I'll never be able to do things as well as you did at C.T.U. 
All I ask is that you not make me feel like an idiot while you're pointing that out. 
All right. 
   Agent Walker... 
the trace is up and running whenever you're ready. 
 Jack? 
 Chloe, I'm on. 
You ready? What's the number? 
202... 
555-0147. 
   It's ringing. 
 Why are you calling me? 
 I was checking AlZarian's computer... 
double-checking everything we planted. 
 And? 
 The bank that we used in Switzerland just e-mailed him... 
rejecting one of the transfers we made in Al-Zarian's name. 
You know how to resubmit it? 
 I'm not sure. 
 Are you getting this? 
Tony's got something on his phone that's encrypting his location. 
I'm trying to get around it. 
All right. Call our man in Zurich. 
He'll walk you through it. 
All right. I just wanted to get 
your authorization before I did that. 
 Any other problems? 
 No. 
 Good. 
 Chloe, did you get that? 
I didn't have time to decrypt all the location data. 
All I know right now is that he's somewhere in the Adams Morgan district. 
 We're running out of time. 
We're gonna have to narrow that down. 
I'm trying. I have to decrypt the rest 
of the location data. 
  How long is that gonna take? 
 I don't know. 
Damn it, Chloe, we've gotta do better than that. 
 I need to get off the phone. 
 Janis, I want you to contact Metro P.D. 
I want you to get them to move their hazmat teams... 
and their tactical teams over to Adams Morgan. 
We're on our way now. Let's go. 
Metro passengers, this weekend there will be no Blue Line express service... 
to Arlington-McLean. 
Express service will be resumed on Monday. 
 I need you to call the police. 
 Excuse me? 
 Speak up, sir. 
 I can't do that. They're listening. 
 Who's listening? 
 The people who have my brother. 
The terrorists. 
They're gonna kill my brother unless I do what they say. 
They want me to get on this train. 
 That's it? 
 Just get on the train? 
Yes, please. You have to help me, okay? 
You have to call the police. 
 Is there a problem here, sir? 
 Yes. 
Yes. Thank you, Officer. 
Please, I need your help. 
Sir, just calm down. Step this way. 
 What is it? 
 Listen. 
They have my brother hostage, okay? 
You have to believe me. 
Put the earpiece back in. 
 What? 
 I said, put the earpiece back in. 
Now. 
Metro cards are available at all Metro stations. 
   Listen, Jibraan... 
I understand you had to try, but don't do it again. 
Your brother's life depends on it. 
Yes, okay. Please 
Just don't hurt him, okay? 
 Well, that's up to you. 
 Yes. Uh, I do whatever you say, okay? 
 I won't cause any more problems, I promise. 
 All right. 
You remember your instructions? 
Uh, yes. Uh 
Westbound Red Line to Washington Center. 
We'll be watching. 
We're always watching. 
     Hello. 
 Ms. Taylor, this is Agent Pierce. 
 Yes, Aaron? 
 Secretary Woods was asking for you. 
You told me you were retiring to the residence... 
but upstairs detail confirmed that you're not there. 
Why is Tim looking for me? 
TheJustice Department is investigating theJonas Hodges car bombing. 
They're requesting phone and Internet records... 
and want to interview everyone as well. 
I didn't realizeJustice was getting involved. 
Apparently there were only 11 people who knew Hodges was alive. 
It stands to reason that information was leaked. 
 Okay. I'll get there as soon as I can. 
 Where are you? 
I needed to run a personal errand. 
Ma'am, am I to understand that you left the White House premises... 
without Secret Service protection? 
I won't be long, Aaron. Ten minutes. 
Ms. Taylor, this 
is a serious breach of protocol. 
Your safety is my responsibility. 
Aaron, I know. 
I promise you, it won't happen again. 
Just cover for me till I get back? 
Will you do that for me, Aaron? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Thank you. 
This is a mistake, Martin. 
We shouldn't be meeting. This 
Okay, you need to calm down, Olivia. 
I needed to see you. 
You were hysterical on the phone. 
No, you don't understand. 
There's an investigation. 
Look, theJustice Department is asking about my whereabouts. 
Okay. Did you think no one would bat an eye 
when a government witness was murdered? 
I told you. I changed my mind. 
I didn't transfer the funds. 
The man you put me in touch with said he wouldn't act until he received payment. 
Why would he go ahead and kill Hodges if he wasn't paid? 
Because I told him to. 
What? 
He called me and told me the money hadn't come through yet. 
I told him you were good for it and to proceed. 
Why, Martin? Why would you do that? 
Hodges was going into witness protection. 
There was a finite window of opportunity. 
And because it's what you wanted, right? 
Despite all my warnings for you to reconsider... 
you looked me straight in the eye and you said... 
you wanted Hodges dead, to make it happen... 
and I did, and he's dead. 
Oh, my God. 
My phone records. MyMy computer 
 Everything  Don't worry about any of those. 
I'll send you a program to erase your Internet tracks. 
The calls to me mean nothing. Olivia, 
the time to worry about your conscience... 
was before you put this in motion. 
If you let this eat away at you... 
people are gonna notice and get suspicious. 
You will bring us both down... 
destroy your mother and her administration. 
Think about it. Is that what you want? 
 No. 
 Okay, then pull yourself together. 
I promise you, this will all pass if you do what I say. 
Can you do that? 
Say it. 
I can do it. 
You need to transfer the funds, Olivia. 
You do not want this man unhappy with you. 
     Hey, honey. 
 Sorry I woke you. 
No, no, no. That's okay. I've been up 
with Teri a couple times anyway. 
She's been havin' a rough night. 
I think she misses her mother. 
Oh. Well, listen, 
I just called to let you know... 
 that my flight's been delayed. 
 Yeah? 
 How long? 
 Well, they're saying an hour, which probably means two. 
 Okay. 
 What? 
I don't know. Maybe you 
should see this as a sign. 
 A sign? 
 That you should stay there. 
Try to convince your father that he should be spending... 
whatever time he has left with his only daughter. 
As much as I want to... 
he made it very clear that he does not want me around to watch him die. 
Okay. All right. Sorry I brought it up. 
   Teri and I will be at the airport to pick you up. 
Wh- Oh. 
My battery is dying. 
Is the hospital okay with that? 
Yeah. I talked to Kevin. 
He said he'd cover my rounds. 
Well, that's-that's great. 
Well, I can't wait to see you guys. 
 Love you. 
 Okay. Bye. 
    I saw you put it in your coat. 
 Oh! 
 Excuse me. 
 It's all right. 
 Sorry. 
 Everything okay? 
 Yeah. Yes. 
    This stop, L Street. 
   Next stop, Washington Center. 
Next stop will be the last stop. 
Next stop, Washington Center. 
The package is in place. 
The dispersal mechanism is set to go off... 
while the train is stopped at Washington Center. 
Good. We're on the move. 
I'll pick you up at 22nd. 
 Jack, I unlocked Tony's location data. 
 Where is he? 
Three blocks immediately south of your position, on 22nd. 
Where exactly on 22nd? 
West side of the block. 
They're coming up on 900 feet ahead of you. 
800 feet. 
All teams, bring your units up from the south. 
 Prepare to move in. 
  You're almost on him. 
 Okay, we've got him. 
 Suspect is in a black van. 
We can't let this turn into a pursuit. Hold on. 
   Hold on. 
Tony was trying to destroy some kind of device when I grabbed him. 
 I got it. 
    That van We want it moved. 
  Yes, sir. 
Lock down this piece of crap. 
  Sir. You got him? 
 Just drag him over here. 
 What do you got? 
 Some kind of mobile computer, but he damaged it pretty badly. 
This has gotta have something to do with the attack. Contact Chloe. 
 See what we can find. 
 Yeah. 
I'm gonna sweep the van for the canister.  
 Tony's U.M.P.C. Device 
is damaged everywhere I look. 
I don't think there's a way to get it back up and running. 
Try a partial reconstruct. Anything that can 
help us find out what Tony's been up to. 
At this point, I don't even know about our chances of even doing that. 
 Chloe  I know. 
 Do me a favor. Send me your screen. 
 Why? 
 Why not? 
  Huh. 
 What? 
  Looks like I can reconstruct the memory state of the U.M.P.C. At the time it was damaged. 
 No, there isn't enough intact data. 
 Yeah, there is in the PROM module. 
A lot of handheld devices back up their memory state there. 
That can't be done, not without the file headers. 
Really? 
Mr. Bauer? Almeida 
just regained consciousness. 
Thank you. Stay with this. 
I need you to walk away. 
Please. You and your men, just walk away. 
Where is it? Where's the canister? 
I am not gonna stop until you tell me where it is. 
Why did you betray me? 
Why? 
I have nothing left to lose. 
You either tell me where that canister is, or so help me God... 
I will lay you down right here, right now. 
You think I've got anything left to lose, Jack? 
Do it. 
 There were a number of applets running. 
We should be able to run them on our hardware. 
I'm uploading a mirror to you now. 
You should have it. 
 You think it's Jibraan? 
 I can't tell, but whoever it is... 
they're southbound on Connecticut at 30 miles an hour. 
And theyjust went right through St. 
Matthew's Cathedral and out the other side. 
He's gotta be on the Metro. 
Yes. The Red Line, 
ending at Washington Center. 
Washington Center's the target. 
Put these in the car. 
Jack, we haveJibraan. 
Jibraan is on the Metro, headed to Washington Center. 
Chloe, this is Jack. I'm back on comm. 
How much time do we have? 
Not long. He's almost there. 
Okay, listen. Tony had to be able to 
communicate with Jibraan somehow. 
See if they were using some kind of comm frequency... 
that was strong enough to work in the subway. 
 Looking. 
 Okay. Wait. There's a proprietary Kband running. 
  That's it. 
 Okay, patch me through. 
  Go ahead, Jack. 
 Jibraan? 
 Jibraan, my name is Jack Bauer. Can you hear me? 
 Uh, yes. 
Your brother is safe. 
I'm working with the F.B.I. 
The man who was holding him hostage has been taken into custody. 
 Let me talk to Hamid. 
 He's not with us right now. 
No, no. I need to talk to him. 
Jibraan, listen to me. 
Your brother is safe, but you are not. 
People who are doing this, they gave you some kind of a package. 
No, no, no. They didn't give me anything. 
 We've got realtime coverage of the station. 
 Okay. 
Jibraan, these people are trying to frame you for a terrorist attack. 
 They had to give you some kind of a package. 
 No. 
Then it's gotta be on the train. 
I want you to start looking for an abandoned suitcase... 
gym bag, knapsack, anything like that. 
No, I can't. Sir, there is nothing. 
It's gotta be there. Keep looking. 
Uh-There was a woman. 
 What woman? 
 She was with him when, uh when they took Hamid. 
I think maybe I saw her get off the train. 
 Are you pulling into the station right now? 
 Uh, yes. 
Okay, I want you to stay on the train... 
and wait for all the passengers to get off. 
    Thank you for using the Metro. 
Welcome to Washington Center Station. 
 It's a bomb, isn't it? 
 It's a biological weapon. 
If it goes off, a lot of people are gonna die. 
 Are all the passengers off the train? 
 Yes. 
Can you see the package? 
 Uh, no. 
 Jibraan, keep looking. It's gotta be there. 
 Jibraan? 
 Yes. Yes, I see it there I see a duffel bag. 
Okay. I need you to open it. 
Wait. Why me? Wh-Why must I do this? 
You're the only person that can, and if you don't, thousands of people are gonna die. 
Jibraan, I need you to open the bag. 
Look, I know I'm asking you a lot. 
Please. 
 Jibraan, are you still there? 
 Uh, it looks like a bomb. 
   I see a light. 
It's a timer, and it's counting down. 
 How much time is left? 
 One minute, 18 seconds. 
That's not enough time for us to get down to you. Try and get the device outside. 
There's an escalator to your right. 
I want you to start moving now. 
Start moving now. 
I'll meet you on the street. 
 We're about a minute out. 
 Okay. Okay. 
Hey! 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 That's him. 
 Hold on! 
 No. I have to get out. 
 Hold on. What's the hurry? 
What is that? Is that even yours? 
I have a bomb! Okay? 
This is a bomb! Get back. 
 Get back! I have a bomb! 
  One side. Move. Move! 
Move. Move, please. Watch out. Move. 
  Don't move! 
  Wait. He's with us. Jibraan! 
Jibraan, I'm the man who was talking to you. 
Give me the canister. 
Go with these men. They'll help you. Go! 
I got it from here, sir. 
 Is he all right? 
 Yes, sir. 
 You are Mr. Bauer? 
 Yes. 
You did great. Thank you for everything. 
I want to see my brother. 
I know. We're gonna bring him here. 
But right now I'd like you to go with Agent Moran so he can take your statement. Please. 
Follow me. 
It's all right. It's all right. 
 You need to give yourself a shot. 
 I already did, 20 minutes ago. 
 It's not working. 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 We stopped it. 
 Yeah. 
You can finally rest. 
   It's okay. 
... and pending for Indianapolis... 
we do apologize for the delay at this time. 
No, uh, departure time at this point. 
  Can I have a piece of the paper? 
  Yeah. Have all this. 
 What's that? 
  This is Section "A." 
It's the only thing I want. 
I'll give it to you soon as I'm done. 
Excuse me. Do you mind if I sit here? 
No, of course not. 
   You heading home? 
 Yeah. 
 Us too. We live in Glendale. 
 Woodland Hills. 
 Oh, my husband's parents live there. 
You know the Pelusos? 
I don't think so. 
 Do you mind doing me a favor? 
 Sure. 
Do you see the man behind us at a table? 
He's wearing a suit. 
 Uh, short, dark hair? 
 Yes. 
Yes. Is he staring over here? 
No. You know him? 
No. It's just that he 
was staring at me earlier. 
Well, you're very pretty. 
 Oh  What? 
No, he's moving away now. 
I've got her in sight. 
She's waiting at the gate now. 
They should begin boarding within the hour. 
Okay, look. I know that 
the bioweapons threat is over... 
but I'd feel a lot better if you'd watch over her until she gets on that plane. 
 Yes, sir. I'll let you know when she's in the air. 
 Thanks. 
I need you to contact the Bureau office. 
Tell 'em we need a full interrogation package ready for when we arrive. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Thanks. 
Folks, help us out here, please. 
Jack. I just got word 
Jonas Hodges was killed with a car bomb less than an hour ago. 
 What? How? 
 We don't have any leads yet... 
but obviously somehow the people he was working for found out he was still alive. 
That means they're gonna be comin' after Tony. 
We need to transport him in a convoy. 
Full guard detail, weapons ready. 
 We're not losing him again. 
 Okay. 
The F.B.I. Iocated Al-Zarian. 
There was nothing we could do. 
You're telling me the canister is gone. 
Damn it! 
Without that pathogen, everything that we worked for is finished. 
You should also know the F.B.I. Has Tony. 
Then you need to have him eliminated. 
 Alan  He knows too much, Cara. 
We can't take the risk that he'll break. 
You need to take him out. 
I'm trying to tell you that won't be necessary. 
Tony won't be in custody for long. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Trust me. 
I've got another play. 
You better have. 
The incoming flight from Boston will be arriving shortly. 
Once the passengers have deplaned... 
and the maintenance crew is given a chance to clean up the aircraft... 
we should be able to begin boarding. 
We appreciate your patience. Thank you. 
Well, at least we know the plane's on its way. 
I'll believe that when I see it. 
Well, I'm gonna get some coffee. 
 Does anybody want anything? 
 I'll take a decaf. 
 Nothing for me, thanks. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Are you sure? It's my treat. 
 No, no. Thank you. 
 Your husband's really nice. 
 Hmm. 
 He has his moments. 
  You know what? I'm- I'm gonna use the 
restroom. Do you mind watching my bag? 
 Sure. 
 Thank you. 
Your attention, please. Passengers on 
delayed flights, please check the monitors... 
for the new departure times and gate assignments. 
... is now ready for boarding. 
All passengers, please report to Gate 17-A. 
Ms. Taylor. 
Agent Pierce... 
I know you're upset I went off protocol... 
but as I told you, it won't happen again. 
No, ma'am, it won't... 
or you'll need to find someone else to do this job. 
Aaron, that won't be necessary. 
Ma'am, you said you left the grounds to run a personal errand. 
May I ask what it was? 
I just needed to get out of here be alone, clear my head, if only for a short time. 
Everything that's happened today being held hostage... 
Jonas Hodges's murder... 
and seeing my father so weak and vulnerable I was feeling overwhelmed. 
Aaron, I'm trying to live up to my mother's expectations... 
and I didn't want her... 
or anyone else, for that matter... 
to know I was being affected by the pressure. 
I hope you can understand that. 
Yes, ma'am. 
I think I can. 
You feeling all right now? 
I am, actually. 
I guess I just needed to tell someone what was going on with me. 
I'm glad it was someone I could trust. 
Well, thank you, ma'am. 
I'll have those phone and Internet records... 
ready for theJustice Department investigator shortly. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Thank you, Aaron. 
   This is Kanin. 
Sir, this is Agent Pierce. 
 I hope I didn't wake you. 
 No, Agent Pierce, I'm wide awake. 
 What can I do for you? 
 Mr. Kanin, some years ago... 
while I served on President Palmer's detail... 
I was made aware of some modifications made... 
to the chief of staff's office. 
 You mean during Mike Novick's tenure? 
 Yes, sir. 
Specifically the installation of a voice-activated recording system... 
that allows staff meetings to be logged and archived. 
If you're asking whether I used the recording equipment, the answer is yes. 
Sir, did you disconnect it when you resigned and left your office? 
No. Why are you asking? 
I'd prefer not to answer that at this time. 
I need to know how to access the digital recorder. 
You can't. It's secured with a biometric lock. 
You need my thumbprint. 
Look, Aaron, if you want my help... 
you're gonna have to tell me what this is about. 
Olivia Taylor's still using my office. 
Does this have to do with her? 
I really can't talk about this over the phone right now. 
I'll be at the White House within the half hour. 
Thank you, sir. 
 Do you have something you'd like to say to me? 
 Like what? 
 Oh, I think you know. 
 I don't think I do. 
How about, " Good job, Janis, on reconstructing the U.M.P.C."? 
Or, "Just maybe I should have considered the possibility that you know what you're doing"? 
Oh, you don't know me, but if you did, you would understand... 
that this is the last place you should look for any type of validation. 
How about just acknowledging you were wrong? 
 We're almost ready to go. 
 Okay. 
 Is this her? 
 Uh Yes, but when I saw her in the Metro, she had on this dark wig... 
and a leather jacket. 
Jibraan, your brother's here. 
Hamid! 
 Let's pack up. 
 Hamid! 
Service to San Francisco now Well, the coffee place over here 'scuse me- didn't have decaf... 
so I had to go all the way to the other end of the terminal. 
But I want you to know, I got it. 
Thank you. 
     This is Bauer. 
 I'm sending a link to your phone. 
It's something I think you should see. 
Who is this? 
Open the link, Mr. Bauer. 
 Who the hell is this? 
 Your daughter's in the company of our operatives. 
And Agent Franks has already been neutralized. 
You will help Tony Almeida escape, or my people will murder your daughter. 
Any effort to contact her or warn anybody about this... 
will have the same result. 
 Do you understand? 
 What you're asking me to do is impossible. 
Tony Almeida's already been secured. 
He's under heavy guard. 
Well, that's your problem. 
Put this call on your earpiece and keep the line open. 
I'm gonna be listening to everything you say. 
Now, Bauer. 
You're gonna pay for what you did to Larry. 
   I thought you were going with Moran. 
Changed my mind. 
I wanna see this through. 
You're gonna make your move to break Almeida out soon. 
I'm gonna tell you what to do and when to do it. 
Oh, and Mr. Bauer? If any of those agents 
in that van get in the way... 
you will have to eliminate them, or your daughter will die. 
Jack? We need a medic! 
Bio-agent is more virulent than we thought. 
 All we're doing here is just masking the symptoms. 
 I understand. 
  There's something you may want to consider. 
 What's that? 
Apossible treatment using stem cells from a genetically compatible donor. 
I saw your file. It says you have a daughter. 
I don't want my daughter involved in this. 
Daddy. 
Agent Walker told me that there's a chance a small chance that I could help you... 
and you don't want me to. 
I'm dying, and whatever small chance there is to stop that from happening... 
it is not worth the pain... 
for me to let you sit there and watch me die. 
Jack, Hodges has 13 Python missiles armed with the bioweapons. 
He demanded that I recall the planes, or he would launch. 
Tony Almeida is still inside Starkwood. 
He believes he can gain access to the fuel depot and lay a series of explosive charges... 
and take the missiles out. 
 What do you think you're doin'? 
 You're gonna take me down to the fuel tanks. 
   You're too late.  
Jonas, we've taken out your missiles. 
It's over, and you're under arrest. 
You can't even begin to imagine what you're up against. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You'll find out. 
Agent Moss, this is Davis at auxiliary gate six. 
I have a Starkwood op in custody. 
He was carrying a canister of the bioweapon. 
 Are you sure? 
 I'm looking at it right now. 
One of the Starkwood ops. 
He's got a canister of the bioweapon. 
So I need you to close down all access roads... 
and alert perimeter units and Metro Police. 
 Janis, get me D.C. Metro. 
 I'm gonna pursue from the air. 
Let's go! 
Come on! 
I'm okay. Tony. Tony! 
Oh, God. Tony. 
 The following takes place between 2:00 a.m. And 3:00 a.m. 
 Yeah. 
 Tricia? Matt. I just got off 
the phone with Secret Service. 
You're cleared with White House security at the south entrance. 
 How soon do you think you can get there? 
 Within the half hour. 
 Do you have any more information why Hodges was arrested? 
 They didn't give me a lot. 
Apparently, Jonas was in some kind of a policy meeting with the president... 
and things got out of hand. 
And that's when he requested his favorite attorney. 
 I'm flattered. 
I'll call you after I've spoken to him. 
Thanks a lot. 
Hurry it up. 
Janis. We just got an I.D. On the suspect. 
One of Starkwood's security cameras picked him up leaving the compound. 
He was carrying a backpack. 
Robert Galvez, two-year Starkwood employee. 
Former Special Forces. 
Relay that information to Larry. 
He needs to know who he's tracking. 
I've been trying. 
He's not answering his comm. 
 How far away is backup? 
 They're still a few minutes out. 
But Agent Park's teams have secured a four-block perimeter. 
The bioweapons canister is secured within the cordon. 
Get Galvez's picture and description out to Tactical and distribute department-wide. 
 Got it. 
 And keep trying Larry. 
 All units, I'm uploading a photo of the suspect... 
to all agents'P.D.A.'s. 
His name is Robert Galvez. 
Be advised he has advanced military training, so proceed with caution. 
Almeida. Almeida, are you there? 
Are you in a secure location? 
I'm holed up in a storage yard near the projects on Jefferson. 
 I just spotted a patrol. 
I think I better keep moving. 
 No, don't! 
The F.B.I. Has got the entire perimeter 
locked down, and they know who you are. 
 How? 
 They have a picture. 
Which means the search teams can I.D. You on sight. 
Just stay put until I can get a read on their search protocols, and I'll guide you out. 
I should have never let you talk me into helping you. 
I promise you, that canister you stole for me... 
is worth a lot of money to the people I'm working for. 
Hell of a lot of good that money's gonna do me in prison. 
Just shut up and do what I tell you to do! 
Guard the canister, stay put and wait for my call! 
    We've got agents down. 
Get a med team out here now. 
Almeida. Almeida, can you hear me? 
What happened? Where's the suspect? 
 He ambushed us. 
 Did you see where he went? 
I don't know. 
Renee, I just got confirmation the tac team has arrived at the scene. 
 Do we have a 20 on Larry? 
 Not yet. 
Excuse me, Agent Walker. 
I know you're busy. 
 Kim. 
 I just came to say goodbye. 
 Goodbye? Where are you going? 
 Back to L.A. 
Uh, I don't understand. 
You're not going through with the treatment to help your father? 
 I mean, it's his only chance for a cure. 
 I know that, and so does he. 
But it's a slim one, and he believes it's not worth taking. 
So if he's gonna die, he wants it to be on his terms. 
Yes, but can't you change his mind? 
I would think you'd know by now that no one can change my father's mind when it's made up. 
I'm- I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry that I put you in this position. 
No, don't be. 
I'm grateful to you, Agent Walker. 
My father and I got to say a lot of things to each other. 
I wish I could have said more, but I don't want to cause him any more pain. 
Renee, Agent Park is on the phone for you. 
 I need to take this. 
 I understand. 
Good luck. 
 This is Walker. 
 It's Park. Agent Moss is dead. 
 What? 
 Apparently, he was killed in an ambush by the suspect. 
The chopper pilot too. 
Tony Almeida's been shot, but he's alive. 
I've got medical personnel working on him now. 
Agent Walker? 
Do we have any lead on Galvez? 
No, but the area's been cordoned off. 
Couldn't have gotten far. 
We're setting up an operations base here on the scene to coordinate the manhunt. 
 How do you want to proceed? 
 Me? 
You're the ranking agent in charge now. 
Maintain the perimeter. 
Begin a south-north sweep. 
I'll chopper out a team and meet you there as soon as I can. 
Agent Walker, I have more than enough personnel. 
 You don't need to be involved in the search. 
 Yes, I do. 
 Keep me posted if you hear anything. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
   Larry? 
 He was killed in a shootout with the suspect. 
 Oh, God. 
I need you to brief the White House on what's happened. 
Call Dr. Macer. Have her deploy 
a hazmat team to the perimeter line. 
Assemble a team to chopper out with me. 
I'm so sorry. 
Someone's gonna need to notify Larry's ex-wife. 
Probably shouldn't be me. 
It's okay. I'll take care of it. 
   All right. 
We've debriefed on hours 8:00 a.m. 
To 3:00 p. M... 
pertaining to the C.I.P. Recovery 
and capture of Ik� Dubaku. 
Now- Mr. Bauer, 
maybe you'd like to take a break. 
No. We need to finish this 
while I still can. Let's go. 
Now, according to your earlier statement, it was about this time... 
it was this time you received intel regarding the imminent attack on the White House. 
Tony Almeida provided me with the intel... 
but we did not know the White House was the target. 
And who was Mr. Almeida's source? 
He was interrogating a mercenary. 
 Did Almeida give you a name? 
 Um Yeah. Sorry. 
Car- Cardiff. 
He said his name was Vincent Cardiff. 
Did you, yourself, question this source? 
No. He didn't survive Tony's interrogation. 
But he was the one who provided us with the intel on the upcoming attack. 
But we did not know that the White House was the intended target at that time. 
 We did not know the White House was the intended target  Mr. Bauer. 
You sure you don't wanna take that break? 
I'm repeating myself again. I'm sorry. 
Here's the data files you asked for, sir. 
Agent Walker's got our assignments, all right? 
 Excuse me. 
   We are not gonna lose control of this situation. 
I know that most of you are tired, working double shifts... 
but I need each and every one of you focused and alert... 
if we are gonna locate the suspect and secure the bioweapon canister that he's carrying. 
While I'm out in the field, you will pass all pertinent information... 
out of this office through Janis. 
Let's get to work. 
Adams, you and your men are with me. 
 Renee. Renee. 
 I'll meet you at the helipad. 
 The bioweapon's still out there? 
 We have it contained. 
Wait a second. Wait a second! 
Just tell me what the hell is going on. 
A Starkwood operative by the name of Robert Galvez got away with a canister of the pathogen. 
We have him trapped inside a perimeter a mile or so from Starkwood's compound. 
 Is Larry in command of the perimeter? 
 He was killed in a firefight. 
 What? 
 Tony was injured. He's at the scene 
with the advance team. 
 Larry's dead? 
 We have two agents down, yes. I have to go. 
You're lucky. An inch to the left, 
the bullet might have nicked the splenic artery. 
 You need to get yourself checked out at the hospital, sir. 
 I can't do that right now. 
   Let me get you something for the pain. 
No. I need to keep my head clear. 
Sweep Nine, this is Mobile Command. 
What's your status? 
Mobile Command, this is Sweep Nine. 
Southeast grid 211 clear. 
Moving on. 
Copy that, Sweep Nine. 
 Sweep Seven, what's your position? 
 Clearing 214. Nothing so far. 
 No sign of him? 
 Don't worry. We'll find him. 
You should get some rest. 
Thanks. 
    Yeah. 
They're sweeping north, clearing grids. 
You got a clear path on Jefferson, all the way up to 12th and 13th Street. 
That should be the last sector they're searching. 
Judging by their progress, it'll give you about 30 minutes. 
 Should be plenty of time. 
 Time for what? 
 You still got that C4 I gave you? 
 Yeah. I got it. 
All right. I want you to find a structure. 
A store or warehouse- something big enough where they have to enter and search. 
We need to draw as many of them into the building as possible... and then blow it. 
 You want me to blow up a couple of dozen F.B.I. Agents? 
 You got a problem with that? 
They're still gonna have the perimeter locked down. 
 I don't see how this is gonna get me out with the canister. 
 Yeah. I got that worked out. 
Ready to go when you're ready. 
Watch your step. 
 Jack, what the hell are you doing? 
 I'm going with you. 
 You're ill. 
 If my condition interferes with your operation... 
 I will stand down, I give you my word. 
 Jack. 
You want to keep arguing about this, waste more time, fine. I'm not getting out. 
Ma'am. 
 Good morning. 
 Good morning. 
   Ms. Eames. You'reJonas Hodges's attorney. 
That's right. 
They told us to expect you. I just need you 
to place your thumb against the glass. 
Okay. Sergeant Cadden 
will escort you to the holding area. 
 Thank you. 
  How could this man have gotten out of Starkwood with a canister of the bioweapon? 
No one's sure, but he's already murdered four people... 
including Larry Moss. 
The F.B.I. Has tracked him 
to a nearby residential district. 
They've sealed off the area and are conducting a thorough search. 
Mom, this man Galvez is a Starkwood operative. Clearly, Hodges is behind this. 
 Maybe. 
 What do you mean, "maybe"? 
As Hodges was taken away, he said it wasn't over. 
He alluded to others. 
Called himself a small cog in a very large machine that I wouldn't be able to stop. 
 He was ranting. 
 That doesn't mean he wasn't telling the truth. 
We need to find out what Hodges knows about this. 
I want him taken to the F.B.I. 
For interrogation. 
He's a sociopath, Mom. 
He's not going to talk. 
He's going to want to make some kind of deal in exchange for his cooperation. 
 Mom, you're not considering that. 
 Olivia You know what this man is, what he did to Roger. 
Just get him to F.B.I. 
Mr. Hodges, 
your attorney's here to see you. 
Well, it's about damn time. 
We're going to need some privacy. 
You're a little taller than her, but it's a good look for you. 
 Hello, Jonas. 
 I'm not gonna ask how you got in. 
But I'm definitely interested in how you're gonna get me out. 
Jonas, you're in a very difficult position... 
and your actions today have put everyone else in a very difficult position. 
Oh, I see. I've upset the cart, have I? 
Everyone's bent out of shape. 
Where the hell were they when the government came after my company... 
when Senator Mayer and his subpoena-waving goon squad... 
were trying to ruin me and everything I built? 
You would have been protected, Jonas. 
You and Starkwood. 
But you jeopardized the plan. 
That bioweapon that you developed for us was not intended for personal use. 
The consensus is that you've had some sort of... 
psychotic break. 
Well, the consensus is wrong. 
Coming from you right now, that's not much comfort. 
I wanna talk to them. 
Get some form of communication between us. 
I wanna talk to them. 
I think it's a little late for that, Jonas. 
You've brought undue attention by showing your hand, exposing yourself. 
And I'm sure you could understand their concern... 
that you may, in fact, expose the others as well. 
 How can I do that? I don't know who they are. 
 You know enough. 
And they need to be certain. 
I think we can agree that there's no reason... 
for your family to pay for your... mistakes. 
Is that why you're here? 
To threaten my family? 
On the contrary... 
I came to guarantee your family's safety if you do the right thing. 
It'll induce a cardiac arrest and leave no trace in your system. 
A natural, dignified death. 
Without you to prosecute, the case against you and your company will be difficult... 
likely impossible... 
preserving at least some small part of Starkwood's legacy... 
of patriotic service. 
Which I know is very important to you. 
Party's over, counselor. 
We're moving him to the Bureau. 
My client has invoked his right to silence and to counsel. 
No one speaks to him unless in my presence. 
Is that understood? 
In some countries, they'd have shot him by now. 
 Process him out. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
Step outside, sir. 
 Hands. 
     Yes. 
 I met with him. 
 And? 
I'm quite certain he understands our terms. 
 They're transferring him to the F.B.I. For interrogation. 
 Will that be a problem? 
Hopefully it'll just pressure him to resolve the situation sooner rather than later. 
I'll be happy when this is behind us. 
Have you heard from Almeida? 
 He called in before I met with Hodges. 
 Mmhmm. 
 Has he secured the canister? 
 Soon. 
He's your guy. 
He better not screw this up. 
Tony's been the one bright spot in an otherwise dreary day. 
I have faith he'll come through. 
   Yeah. 
I found a place to set up. 
It's an abandoned apartment building just shy of the north perimeter line. 
1297 Rincon, corner of 12th. 
Yeah, I see it. 
Sweep teams are just entering three sectors to the south. 
 You got less than 20 minutes. 
 That doesn't give me much time. 
No, it doesn't. Maybe you should get off 
the phone and get to it. 
I lost two partners in a row. 
Early on. 
I couldn't handle it. 
I guess that's why, over the last 10 years, I've pretty much worked alone. 
It's all right for you to be feeling what you're feeling. 
But if you can't do this tonight, that's all right too. 
Just don't try to pretend like you're not feeling anything. 
 That's how you make a mistake. 
 Please, Jack. 
Don't tell me what to feel and don't tell me how to feel it. 
Come on! Let's go! 
Right over there. 
 Jack! 
 Where is he? 
 Around the S.U.V. 
 You okay? 
Yeah, I got lucky. 
The bullet went right straight through. 
 I didn't think I'd see you out here. 
 I'm only here for observation. 
You do not have to do this. 
Show me. 
Cover him up. 
I'm sorry about Larry. 
 How the hell did this happen? 
 It all went down pretty fast. I mean 
We were ambushed before we got out of the helicopter. 
The chopper pilot was hit first... 
and I was unarmed, so Larry laid down cover so I could get clear. 
I don't remember a lot, but I definitely heard auto fire. 
Once I was tagged, Larry came over to help me out, and that's when he was hit. 
I blacked out after that, but I'm pretty sure Larry saved my life. 
Larry was hit with heavy ordnance shotgun rounds, armor-piercing. 
You obviously were hit with something smaller-jacketed. 
I treated Mr. A lmeida. His wound 
was consistent with a nine-millimeter. 
 You sure it wasn't a.45? 
 Not likely. The entry was too small. Why? 
Because you have spent.45 casings in evidence. 
Galvez had access to the weapons inside the F.B.I. Vehicle he stole. 
He probably switched in the middle of the fight. 
That many weapons? In the time frame 
that you described the ambush? 
 Doesn't add up. 
 Okay. So what are you saying? 
Someone was with him. 
Like I said, it all happened pretty fast, but I mean, I didn't think so. 
I guess it makes sense. 
One man didn't do this alone. He had help. 
I'll tell Park to alert the field. 
 You sure you're okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
Good. 
 Hello. 
 Did I wake you? 
No. Who could sleep 
after what happened today? 
How'd it go with your father? 
   Sweetheart? 
What is it? What happened? 
 He's dying, Stephen. 
 What? 
He was exposed to something, like a biological agent. 
It had something to do with the attacks that took place earlier today. 
Kim, honey, I'm so sorry. 
Um, isn't there anything that they can do? 
No. 
 I'm coming back home. 
 Don't you wanna stay? 
Don't you wanna be with him as long as you can? 
My presence, with what he's going through right now, will only make things worse. 
 Did you at least, uh   Did you tell him about his granddaughter? 
Hi, honey. 
   Kim. 
I couldn't, Stephen. 
I couldn't bring myself to tell him I wasn't the only person he was leaving behind. 
Telling him about Teri would have only made it worse. 
I'm gonna try and get on the 6:10. 
 If I do, I'll be back in L.A. By 9:00. 
 Okay. 
You can always leave later, if you change your mind. 
I won't. 
I love you both. 
We love you too. Bye. 
 Mobile Command, this is Sweep Nine. 221 is clear. 
 Copy, Nine. Proceed to 224. 
 Copy that. 
Why has that area of the grid not been cleared? 
Sweep Three, why have you not cleared 219? 
Mobile Command, we're encountering some resistance from the neighborhood residents. 
They're not happy about their homes being searched without a warrant at 2:30 in the morning. 
I'm concerned about their safety, not their happiness. 
Whoever was helping Galvez may be providing him shelter in one of those houses. 
If those civilians are interfering in that sweep, arrest them. 
 But get that area cleared. Do you understand? 
 Copy that. 
 Jack. 
 Excuse me. 
Westbound is his point. 
It's my anti-seizure medicine. 
I should have used it earlier. 
Jack, what are you doing out here? 
Why don't you go back to F.B.I. Medical 
and let them treat you? 
 There is no treatment. There's no cure. 
 Wait a minute. 
I'm sorry. I didn't know. 
Yeah. 
Why are you in the field? 
Agent Walker just lost her partner, Tony. 
Thought I could help. 
I owe her that much. 
Agent Stoller to Mobile Command. 
Code yellow. 
Go ahead, Agent Stoller. This is Mobile 
Command. Are you reporting a code yellow? 
Affirmative. I have a confirmed visual 
on the target suspect with the canister. 
   Repeat: Confirmed visual of suspect and canister. 
Agent Park, may I? 
Agent Stoller, this is Jack Bauer. 
Is Galvez with someone? Agent Stoller? 
Negative. He's alone. 
Repeat. He is alone. 
 Copy that. 
  What's his 20? 
Entering an abandoned apartment building on the south side of Rincon and 12th. 
 I am in pursuit. 
 Try to maintain a visual and wait for backup. 
 Do not engage until we get there. 
 Copy that. 
 All primary units respond to 12th and Rincon. 
Suspect sighted entering building with canister. 
 Code yellow. 
  Agent Park. 
I want a secure net around the building. 
Agents at all exits. 
 I want sharpshooters covering all four exposures. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Jack. 
  I can't. 
It's all right. I'll be fine. 
I'll stay back. I'll watch operations. 
You be careful out there. 
I still think Galvez has a partner. 
You watch your back. 
Thank you. 
All right. Let's go. 
Hellfire. 
You served with the 27 th in Pakistan. 
Two tours, sir. 
Did you, by any chance, encounter any Starkwood units? 
   There was a force protection team attached by my C.O. 
 They fought with you. 
 Yes, sir. Side by side. 
Soldier. 
How would you rate their professionalism, their performance under fire? 
They were good men, sir. Well trained. 
Thank you, son. You just made my day. 
Let's go. 
Our orders are to deliver the prisoner to the rear entrance at F.B.I. 
White House wants to keep this low-key. 
Sarge. 
This is Sergeant Cadden! 
Prisoner's in severe cardiac and respiratory distress! 
We are rerouting to West Arlington Hospital. 
Need emergency medical team standing by! 
Go, go! 
 Assemble the teams. 
 Got it. 
Agent Stoller, this is Agent Walker. 
Do you copy? 
 I copy you, Agent Walker. 
 What is your position? 
East of stairwell, between the first and second floor. 
Suspect with canister has moved to the top floor. 
 Do you have any indication that he's not alone? 
 Negative. Not at this time. 
All right. Stand by. We're coming to you. 
Agent Stoller puts the suspect somewhere on the second floor. 
However, there's no guarantee that he's the only hostile in the building. 
Therefore, we stick to S.O.P. 
Clearing room by room. 
Agent Park and I will lead two teams, east and west. Check your weapons and headsets. 
 We move in 60 seconds. 
  You guys are with me. 
You guys are with Agent Walker. 
 Mobile Command. This is Walker. 
 Go ahead, Agent Walker. 
We're about to enter the building. 
Have hazmat teams on alert in case the canister gets breached. 
 How you holdin' up? 
 Better, thanks. 
  Move! 
  Go! 
We're movin'in! 
   Excuse me. 
 This is Bauer. 
 Mr. Bauer, this is Agent Mizelli. 
Sorry to bother you with this, but I need to follow up on something from our debrief. 
 Agent, this isn't a good time. 
 Some new information has come to light... 
 and I need to clear up a discrepancy. 
 What discrepancy? 
You told me Tony Almeida's source on the White House attack... 
 was a man identified to you as Vincent Cardiff. 
 Yeah, that's right. 
Is there a possibility you misremembered the name? 
 No, I don't think so. 
 Are you sure? 
You, yourself, had voiced some concern about your own acuity. 
Hold on. What is this here? 
Agent Mizelli, I'm gonna have to get back to you. 
 Locator codes for all units'radio transponders. 
 Are they in real time? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Can you do a map overlay? 
 It'll take a minute. 
 Get it done. 
 What's going on, Jack? 
 I'm not sure yet. 
   Second level. 
Clear. 
   We can go through it. 
Let's see the next room. 
Bring it back. 
Clear. Heading to the third floor. 
To the third level. 
Here's the all clear! 
Let's go! Let's go! 
Right there. There's Stoller's transponder. 
He's not even in the building. 
Agent Walker, this is Jack. 
Get your men out of the building. 
 It's a trap. 
 Jack, what? 
Stoller's not even in there. 
Get your men out now! 
 Code blue! Repeat, code blue! 
   Cold blue! Move 'em out! 
 Move, move! 
Keep back! 
Agent Walker! Agent Park! 
Get us a vehicle. Now! 
All perimeter teams, this is Park. Agents 
are down at corner of 12th and Rincon. 
 We need assistance. 
 Negative, negative. Disregard that order. 
Maintain your positions. 
I repeat, maintain your positions. 
 What the hell are you doin'? 
 They are trying to pull you off the line. 
You leave a hole in that perimeter, we are gonna lose the canister. 
Tell your men to stand fast. Medevac 
is on its way. Get them in the air now! 
   I got you. 
Set up a triage! 
Up, up. 
Jack, I'm goin' in! 
Agent Park! Agent Park! 
 How many men are unaccounted for? 
 Still assessing. 
There were at least 30 of us in the building when it went up. 
 And Agent Walker? 
 I don't know. 
Renee, this is Jack. Do you copy? 
Renee, this is Jack. Do you copy? 
Almeida. 
 You have the canister? 
 Yeah. 
Let me see. 
Hurry up. We need to get moving. 
Renee! 
Renee! 
 Renee! 
 Jack! 
Jack! 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. But he's not breathing. 
We need a medic! 
They've got him. I want to get you out of here. 
Come on. Let's go now! 
 How'd you know it was a trap? 
 Stoller's transponder was outside of the building. 
They were trying to thin our ranks, create a diversion. 
 Has the cordon been breached? 
 No. I told the men to maintain their positions. 
 The perimeter's secure. 
 It's almost like they knew, Jack. 
They would've needed time to wire this building with explosives. 
This is the last sector we were due to search. 
 You think they knew your sweep patterns? 
 They must have. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What is it, Jack? 
I'll meet you back at your vehicle. 
 Hey, you want me to take him? 
 No, I got him. They need your help inside. 
  Agent Mizelli. 
 This is Bauer. 
You said you wanted to talk to me about Tony's suspect, Vincent Cardiff? 
Yes, yes. Thanks for gettin' back to me. 
Listen, you told me that he expired during the course ofTony Almeida's interrogation? 
 Yeah, that's what Tony told me. 
 Well, it can't be him. 
What are you talking about? 
Vincent Cardiff was picked up over an hour ago by Customs... 
 trying to cross the border into Canada. 
 Are you sure? 
Look, I'm positive. I've got his 
arrest report right here. Cardiff's alive. 
Were there any signs from his interrogation? 
Physical violence, abuse. 
 Anything at all. 
 Nothing's indicated on the report. 
That's why I was asking if maybe you had mistaken the name that Almeida gave you. 
 Okay. I got him. 
 Thanks. 
Tony! 
 Tony! 
 Yeah? 
 We need to talk. 
 Sure. 
What's goin' on? 
I told you earlier today, if you were lying to me, I'd kill you myself. 
What the hell you talkin' about? 
Cardiff. Vincent Cardiff! You said 
he was killed during his interrogation. 
 Yeah. So? 
 He's alive and well, in custody. 
And he's showing no signs of physical abuse. 
Explain that. 
All right, look, Jack. I'm sorry. 
Cardiff knew that by spilling that intel, he was gonna get himself killed. 
So I cut a deal with him. 
I told him I'd let the F.B.I. Think he was dead 
so he could walk away and disappear. 
I thought it was just a meaningless lie. 
You and I have been doing this long enough to know... 
that there is no such thing as a meaningless lie. 
 How are you involved in this? 
 You're not making any sense, Jack. 
That intel was good. 
Without it, you'd have never been in the White House to save the president. 
What is your involvement? 
 You're not thinkin' straight. 
 How were you shot? 
Does Galvez even have a second man, or was itjust you? 
Just stop and listen to what you're sayin'. 
It's insane. 
It's paranoia. 
Now, why don't you put the gun down? 
Don't you move! 
The toxin's starting to affect your judgment. 
That's what's happening. 
You can see that, right? 
Is this what you're lookin' for? 
I never wanted to hurt you, Jack. 
I told you to stay out of it, but you wouldn't listen, would you? 
Can we get some help here? 
This man's havin' a seizure. 
Stand back, please. 
Go get my bag, and call Dr. Macer, stat. 
You're gonna be all right, sir. 
Just try to breathe. 
Relax. It's gonna be okay. 
I don't see anything. 
The wound must be posterior. 
Sir, I need to turn you on your side. 
Put it down. Keep driving. Now! 
Ioning sponsored by                20th century fox television      And brought to you by ford.    
           Drive one.            
That was bob cornell at nsa.     
    They've detected             another firewall breach.         
 There's been another attack?    
 Not yet, but they believe the    cip device is being utilized.   
We have to assume dubaku         is initiating another attack.    
        Madam president.         
        What is it, tim?         
I've just been forwarded             a scrambled call.            
                      It's from                  colonel dubaku.  
                 He's demanding               to speak with you.  
 The deadline for your forces    To begin their withdrawal                  has passed.            
    Go to the window.            
    See what you have done.      
    Comply with my demands           within the hour,             Or 10,000 more americans                 will die.                
     She's on her way up.        
 I'll call you when it's done.   
Mr. Taylor,                      
are you okay?                    
        (groans)                         (grunts)                 Audio forensics                  cleaned up the recording.        
Nichols (over computer):              walker is extraneous.       
 Kill her before you get here.   
Larry, I don't think             it's worth it.                   
There's nothing here.            
            All right. Fine,     
          Help janis coordinate                        with nsa.  
I'm sorry                        about renee.                     
She was a good agent.            
         We don't know                that she's dead yet!        
     I've devoted my life                 to the bureau                       And you just expect                    me to believe  That the entire government's                     been corrupted.  
             Jack:                    not all of them.            
  But until we find out who,         we can't trust anyone.       
      And the four of you        really think you can stop this?  
                    We have to.  
        It's as simple as that.  
Dubaku wants you and your wife.  
    That's the deal.             
    You're asking us                 to risk our lives                    To be delivered into                     dubaku's hands.  
      Listen to him, ule.        
But how can we                   trust this man?                  
                        Because  He has no reason                 to lie.                          
        Nichols:                 how are you doing, tony?         
          All right.             
                      Buchanan:              where's emerson?     
          He's dead.             
You want matobo                  or not?                          
        (gunshot)                  You got what you came for.     
Now, get the hell                out of here.                     
  Did everything go smoothly?    
     We have the matobos,             that's what matters.        
I heard about the planes                  on the radio.           
        The white house              still has not complied.      
What do you intend to do?        
Exactly what we promised.        
We're ready, sir.                
             Where's the target                      located?     
Kidron, ohio.                    
                 Population?     
30,000.                          
Casualties will be high.         
            Begin.               
                         Larry.  
  We think this is the truck      the matobos were abducted in.   
        Where was this                    image taken?            
                Near northwoods                        airfield.  
         Were you able                    to track it?            
        Not beyond this sector.  
          But they were heading      east on mckinley avenue.     
All right.                       
Make sure the vehicle I.D.       
        Is disseminated                to all search teams              And local agencies.        
Yes, sir.                        
     Larry, I think I found              something.               
Yeah?                            
 I've been working nsa, trying    to back-trace the cip attack    That took down the two planes.   
  And I found a code fragment    Which I think could be residue       from the cip intrusion.      
I'm running a pattern            match right now.                 
With any luck at all,            We may be able to anticipate         where in the infrastructure  They're targeting next.          
And I need sean.                 
             Janis, I don't want              to waste personnel        On some wild-goose chase.  
    Dubaku's threatened to kill            10,000 more americans                   In the next 30                      minutes.     
      I understand that,               And I will drop it         the minute it feels cold.        
        All right, I'm going to           brief the white house.  
        Keep me in the loop.     
    Sean.                        
Are you sure he's up to running          this operation?          
                Larry's fine.    
        Is he?                   
  You're the one who told me          about him and renee.        
This has got to be hitting       him pretty hard.                 
    If I don't think                  larry can do his job,             I'll let you know,                   all right?             
     In the meantime, I need you      to open up a fresh socket.  
        (phone ringing)                  (phone ringing)                (ringing continues)                Gedge's voice:                   you've reached                 agent brian gedge.         
    Please leave a message       and I'll get back to you.        
             (beep)                        agent gedge,             I expected to hear from you                by now.              
It's urgent that I speak         with the first gentleman              As soon as possible.        
    (intercom beeps)               Call me back, agent gedge.     
 This is extremely important.    
             Yes?                
          Secretary:             larry moss with the fbi.         
     Where are we, larry?        
    We've I.D.'d a vehicle       
That we believe was used           in the matobos' abduction.     
      We're still trying             to track it down.            
     And how long is that                going to take?           
 I wish I could tell you, sir.   
  I don't have a time frame.     
That's not good enough, larry.   
 Unless you get some results,     we're going to get hit again.   
            A lot of people are                  going to die                     If you don't                     find dubaku.     
         With all respect, sir,          I don't need to be told              what's at stake.     
We're giving everything we can.  
    One of our agents                  has given her life.        
  Yes, I was told about that.    
    I'm... I'm sorry.            
I'll call you the minute               we have something.         
    We'll be waiting.            
        (sighs):                             god....              
Chloe:                           the matobos have been taken      into a building.                 
          546 adams.             
Okay, pull up the stats          on that address.                 
                          On it. 
It's the ritter building,              four stories high.         
The building                     is two years old.                
  Give me the security specs.    
Give me a minute.                
    We're coming up on it.       
I'm going to need                your help.                       
        (beeping)                                I see you've                 chosen a target.     
    The boyd chemical plant            near kidron, ohio.         
                 The cip device                   has enabled us               To take control of                   the main tank.  
We're about to cause the         primary safety valves to fail.   
 Do you remember the last time       we saw each other, ule?      
It was at a state dinner               in your residence.         
We shared an excellent           bottle of wine.                  
    I offered my hand                     in friendship             And you... Slapped it away.    
  You gave me an ultimatum--         To be the puppet                   for your military.         
You could have had a long             and prosperous career             As prime minister.         
But now you're going back                  to sangala              As a traitor to your people.    
     I am prime minister.        
 I was elected by the people.    
    It's you and juma                 who are the traitors.       
No.                              
 We brought order to sangala,    But you are trying               to destroy                       Everything                       that we've built.                
     You'll be taken back            to sangala, ule,             And you will give                general juma                         The names of all                  your fellow traitors.       
     I will never do that.       
            Never.               
            Hmm...               
     Believe me, you will.       
          Take them.             
Any response                     from the president?              
    Not yet.                     
But once she sees                dead americans                   Lying in the street,             she will be less stubborn.       
    I'm inside, jack,              approaching the front desk.    
          Copy that.             
        Are the motobos          still on the third floor?        
      Affirmative, jack.         
     They're being moved.        
 I'm just not sure where yet.    
          Copy that.             
            Good afternoon.      
            I'm agent walker                       with the fbi.  
                I don't have                     an appointment,  But I'm here to see              mr. Roane of roane               
and associates.                  
I'll let them know you're here.  
            Actually, I don't            want to be announced.    
 I'm here on official business.  
          All right.             
So as far as you're concerned,    I was never here, understand?   
Yes, ma'am.                      
Past security.                   
Heading toward                   the elevator.                    
            We're on our way to            the service entrance.  
Chloe, I'm on the third floor.   
Law firm is                      on your left.                    
On your right is a suite         of offices where matobo's                  Being held.            
        I see it.                
 Stairwell's down the hallway             to your left.           
        (hissing)                Agent walker, we're at the door. 
There's one guard outside          the suite, probably armed.     
  Bill, take the third floor.    
      Wait for my signal.        
                 Go on.          
Chloe, we're on the fourth floor       In what used to be               the computer room.         
                 What now?       
In the center                    of the room                      There are two                    removable panels.                
This should give you             access to the crawlspace.        
            Copy that.           
             Okay, we're clear.  
                      Let's go.  
                      We're in.  
  I should never have allowed         you to come with me.        
    It was a mistake.            
It was not your decision, ule.   
     We will be all right.       
                Jack bauer will                    be here soon.  
Okay.                            
We're at the heating unit.       
          Okay, jack,                  there's an airduct             Leading off that unit;               do you see it?           
             Yeah.               
Follow that for about 30 yards            Until you see               an electrical junction.      
         Make a left,                 then another 20 yards       You'll come to the vent.         
This will give you a view        of the entire floor.             
    And the matobos?             
They've been moved               into a adjacent room             Just off the main area.          
            Okay, copy that.     
        Come on.                 
             Sean:                   the entire nsa has been           combing the firewall                 Searching for the next               cip device breach.  
    If this were something,              don't you think           They'd already know about it?   
    I can live without your          negativity today, sean.      
      There it is again,         that same code fragment.         
                "kidron, ohio."  
        what's in kidron, ohio?  
Any sensitive installations?     
Something dubaku                 might want to hit?               
                 I don't know.   
Homeland has a high-value            Target database;               I'm cross-checking it now.     
          Okay. Okay,            
nothing in kidron itself,            But in the neighboring           county there's...            
                  Boyd chemical. 
Boyd chemical.                   
What do they make?               
            Insecticide. Please  
            get me that number.  
            Hello?               
  This is janis gold at fbi.     
        I need to speak               To your plant manager            immediately, please.        
    Ma'am, as I just stated          I'm with the fbi.            
    Does that sound vaguely          important to you?            
                Now, connect me              to john brunner.     
  Fbi? Uh, yeah, put her on.     
     This is john brunner.       
    Janis (on phone):                        hello.               
         Mr. Brunner,            
this is janis gold, fbi,                  D.C. Bureau.            
    What can I do for you?       
      We've been tracking                 some possible             Breaches in the government             firewall.                
    The firewall's designed      to protect installations                  Like yours...           
  I know what it does, honey.    
      Um, we have tracked                 And isolated                 one of these breaches       In the kidron area.              
I need to know                   are you experiencing             Any problems right now?          
As a matter of fact, we're       dealing with one right now.      
          What is it?            
             Three of our safety               valves just failed  On the primary storage tank.    
     We're having trouble                resetting them.          
What's in that tank?             
              Methyl isocyanate. 
              It's concentrated       insecticide, highly toxic.  
    Can you-- what the hell            is this all about?         
  Mr. Brunner, I have reason     
        To believe that            this is a terrorist attack         On your facility.            
    Terrorist attack?            
            Yes, sir, I need                     you to initiate                On-site emergency                       procedures           And stay on this line.  
      Shut down the tank.        
        What's going on?         
         Do it! Do it!           
         My authority.           
                        Damn.    
          What is it?            
      It's not responding.       
What do you mean?                
Try it again.                    
        Nothing.                 
                Pressure in the          primary tank is rising.  
        Son of a bitch.          
          Mr. Brunner?           
            We cannot shut down              the primary tank                 And the pressure                     is building.     
              If we cannot stop          this, we are looking         At atmospheric release.      
                 Okay.           
          Get larry.             
      Dubaku has targeted                that facility.           
            We need to alert                      the president.  
         Mr. Brunner,            
 You need to begin evacuating        people right now.            
    All right, agent moss,           keep me apprised.            
 I'll speak to the president.    
        I just received               an interagency alert.       
        The fbi just discovered            dubaku's next target.  
    A chemical plant, yeah.      
I just got off the phone             with larry moss.             
                 I need to brief                  the president.  
Has the first gentleman          spoken with the president?       
                  Not yet.       
        I talked to agent gedge                  40 minutes ago.  
Mr. Taylor is                    
the only person who              can talk the president           Into withdrawing                 our troops in sangala.           
And that is our best way             to prevent this attack.      
            I know we need him.  
 I'm waiting for a call back.    
  The middle section's still      bothering me; read it again.    
                        Angela:          "colonel dubaku and the          juma regime have killed       "countless thousands             of their own people,            "and now hundreds                of our fellow citizens.      
      They deserve your prayers               and your outrage."  
  I think the word "outrage"           might be too strong                    If you're trying                           to convey  Calm authority.                  
  "outrage" is the only word      To describe how I'm feeling,         and how every person        In this country will be feeling. 
      The american people              deserve the truth.         
Dubaku's already                 killed 300 americans.            
God knows what else              he has planned.                  
      (knocking on door)                 Come in.                 
 Could you excuse us, angela?    
            What is it?          
    The fbi believes                 they've detected                  Where the next attack           will take place.             
        Dubaku's infiltrated                 a chemical plant                     Just outside of                    kidron, ohio.  
He's causing the pressure            on the facility's             Primary tank to go critical.    
If the tank erupts,              over 3,000 gallons               Of methyl isocyanate will        be released into the atmosphere. 
  Given the prevailing winds,                      A very large,              very toxic cloud     Will sweep into town.            
              Methyl isocyanate  Is a concentrated insecticide.   
      Even brief exposure        causes severe lung damage                     And chemical burns                  of the skin.     
    What's our time frame?       
    The tank could rupture       in less than 15 minutes.         
They've begun evacuating?        
        We've already contacted          emergency responders     On the ground in kidron.         
It's just not enough time             to get everyone out.        
     Kidron's population's           just over 30,000.            
This projection says that            We could lose over 50%?      
    Oh, dear lord...             
Ethan:                           right now, our only chance       of stopping this                     Is finding dubaku                  and the cip device.        
    You ready?                   
      Quietly.                   
      Chloe (on earwig):         jack, I just intercepted         An fbi alert identifying              dubaku's next target.       
A chemical plant                 near kidron, ohio,               12 minutes from going            critical. There are 30,000       
  People in that town, jack.     
    We have to hurry.            
        Jack (quietly):                    copy that.             
    Give me the scope                    out of the bag.          
         (bag unzips)                     Turning scope                over to night-vision.       
      I don't see dubaku.        
We've got nichols.               
Three men with                   automatic weapons.               
Three more over                  at the control station,          most likely armed.               
          Copy that.             
That's dubaku.                   
We got dubaku.                   
  Chloe, are you seeing this?    
Yes. The control station         
looks like an s-dart.            
's a really                      powerful processor.              
             It could be driving                  the cip device. 
 Copy.                           
    Nsa's classified                   infrastructure team        Is trying to plug                the firewall breach.             
        Any luck so far?         
          None so far,           but they're staying on it.       
             They have less than     Ten minutes left.            
     They're aware of that, sir,     But they're doing                    what they can.           
    Not now.                     
What's going on                  at the plant?                    
          I'm on with them now.  
              John? Did you try  
Flashing the memory cards?       
         (alarm blares)                  Brunner:                       three times, honey.        
     We're not in control            of the computer system.      
  I've already told my people     to get the hell out of here.    
              Normally, I don't                  allow people             To call me "honey," but       we can discuss that later.  
     Yeah, well, it sounds        like you need to lighten up.    
(alarm continues blaring)                  good, good.            
          I'm heading            to the primary tank room.        
 I'm going to try to manually                    Release some                 of the pressure.     
 That's not going to stop it.    
    No, but it might buy us            A few more minutes             so people can evacuate.      
  I've got a thousand workers        at this facility.            
     And I am responsible            For their safety.            
         (door buzzes)            Now look, I need you to stay             on the phone.           
I'm going                        to need some help.               
                     Absolutely. 
                  What can I do? 
I don't have access                To the override schematics.    
    See if you can pull up       The operating procedures                  for tank one.           
Yeah, yeah, yeah.                
I got it.                        
      I got it right here.       
        All right.               
        Now look                     for the emergency valve          Release sequence.            
    Okay.                        
             Uh, valve release.  
          I have it right here.  
          This, wait,                this procedure is going       To release the chemical right     Into the primary tank room     where you are right now.         
         I know that.            
  I have respiratory gear on.    
         I'll be okay,             just give me the sequence.     
              But how long will                that protect you?  
 Don't worry about it, honey.    
     Uh, okay.                   
Are you looking                  at the routing board?            
             I am.               
        Go ahead.                
        Set the bus switches                 To this sequence                 from left to right:                              Two. 
              Two.               
                          Eight. 
             Eight.              
                          Seven. 
             Seven.              
                        Four.    
             Four.               
                          Three. 
             Three.              
             Done.               
The secondary flow valve         Should be behind you             and to your right.               
             I need you to turn           that clockwise please.  
        (steam hissing)                  (grunts)                           All right.             
     All right, I got it.        
 Okay, that's one valve down,        Three more to go.            
          (groaning)                       (coughing)                  (electronic beeping)        Pressure inside the tank             is approaching 400 psi.      
        How long before                the tank ruptures?         
Seven minutes.                   
                    Nichols:             we've got a problem.     
         What is it?             
                    An alert.    
Our hidden surveillance camera            on the roof.            
             Almeida and bauer.  
     When was this taken?        
        20 minutes ago.          
     I thought you killed              almeida and bauer?         
Damn it! You said                
this location                    Was kept secret                  from everyone!                   
                 It was.         
Then what are they doing here?!  
                I don't know.    
     How did they find us?!      
         I don't know!           
            600 psi and rising.  
         (low beeping)           Disengage the cip module.        
Begin the offload.               
            What are you doing?  
            We're almost there.  
 We will continue this attack        from another location.       
Let's finish this.               
            We can handle them.  
We need to get out of here now.  
 The cip module's disengaged,          starting off load.         
             Sean:                 hey, what the hell is that?    
        What the hell is that?!  
      What's the matter?         
The firewall breach just closed. 
Larry:                           what?!                           
  What are you talking about?    
    No cip intrusion,                the firewall is secure.      
         How? Nsa?               
         I don't know.           
     Bring the cip module.       
Get motobo and his wife!         
             Bill, we should go  With the second option           on the assault.                  
Two-prong attack. You and tony   
come through the main entrance.  
     We'll go in from here.      
        Copy.                    
                 Give me the c4                   out of the bag. 
                    Go!          
             Move.               
                          Move!  
        (gunshot)                            Get the cip device!  
            Clear!               
     All clear over here!        
          Get dubaku?            
        Negative!                
Jack, I've got the cip device.   
     It's been destroyed.        
    Jack, it's renee.            
     The motobos are safe.       
  I'm taking them to the van.    
     Copy that. I want you       
    And bill to do a sweep.      
  See if you can find dubaku.    
  I'll cover the south side.     
John? John, are you still there? 
        (weakly)                              yeah.               
      John, listen to me.        
    The terrorists are out               of the system.           
Please tell me what is happening           right now.             
        (steam hissing)              Automatic shutdown mode              has kicked in.           
     Pressure's dropping.        
    I think we're gonna be                 all right.             
      Okay, that's great.        
Now you-you gotta get out              of there right now.        
      (labored breathing)                (coughs)                              John?               
      (labored breathing)        I can't make the door...         
 I'm sending the rescue team.    
A rescue team                    is on its way.                   
                John, please                     stay with me.    
                  Stay with me.  
      (people clamoring)             Have they found dubaku?      
Still searching.                 
            Renee:               first responders are five              minutes away, jack.        
          Copy that.             
            Get up.              
(gasping)                                     I said get up!      
         (whimpering)                      (quietly):                     they're coming.          
Please don't make                me do this.                      
I will go to your home, michael. 
I'll make you wife watch                               As I kill                   your daughter,                  And then I will                        kill her.  
                So do as I ask.  
    Save your family.            
    Let me see your hands!       
                It's latham.     
    Where's dubaku?!             
          I'm sorry.             
    (device beeping)                         Cover!               
          Tony! Bill!            
Yeah!                            
                  You all right? 
                          Jack?  
             Jack?               
    Jack, can you hear me?       
    Yeah, yeah, we're okay.      
                 What happened?  
    Latham was wired                 with explosives.             
  We still don't have dubaku.    
             What?               
                 The cip device              has been destroyed.  
             I want you to stay                with the motobos.  
        Make sure they're safe.  
     (sirens approaching)        Jack the police are almost here. 
If you get arrested,             this entire operation            goes out the window.             
 You have to get out of there.   
                      Copy that. 
He's gone.                       
                    Buchanan:                 we need to get back               to the safe house. 
Let's go.                        
     (sirens approaching)        Sean, this stays both nsa        and homeland have no idea        Why the breach at the kidron     plant was stopped.               
         They're still looking.  
We're working on it here also.   
     Janis is coordinating        with a digital forensics team   That she sent over to the plant. 
 This doesn't make any sense.    
Why... Why would dubaku suddenly 
        stop an attack           When he was minutes away          from causing mass casualties?   
 Maybe there was a malfunction         in the cip device.         
 No, no, I don't want maybes,      all right? I want answers.     
We're doing everything we can,                sir.                
    That's not good enough             right now, is it?!         
    I don't know what else           to tell you, sir.            
            I know you're upset                  about renee,     But getting angry at me is not   going to make it go any faster.  
If you think I'm yelling at you       because of my history             With agent walker,             you are mistaken.            
 There are thousands of lives            at stake here.           
That's what concerns me.         
          Sorry, sir.            
I want you and janis             to work with nsa.                
Find out where that cip device   is being used.                   
    If we find the device,               we find dubaku.          
    I appreciate the call.       
         Thanks a lot.           
Janis, larry wants               you to interface with nsa.       
See if you can back-trace        that cip code fragment           to its source.                   
        I'll try.                
Who were you talking to?         
 The head of the response team            at the plant.           
    What did he say?             
    Facility's clean.            
A trace amount of the chemical    was released, but not enough        To do any damage,            and the site has been secured.   
         That's good.            
What about                       the plant manager?               
         John brunner.           
          Is he okay?            
              No.                
                    Will you do                      me a favor?  
          It depends.            
    I'd like to track down            mr. Brunner's family.       
I was the last one               to speak with him,                 And I feel they should know        how brave he was.            
I'll see what I can find.        
                     Thank you.  
Janis, before you start          sending flowers,                   You need to find out where     that cip device was being used.  
      I know. I'm on it.         
Cleanup crews                    are already on site              And we're continuing             our evacuation of                a one-mile radius                Around the chemical plant.       
                    Casualties?  
There was, in fact,              one casualty,                                 The plant manager.  
            13 other workers                 are being treated                 For chemical burns                   and inhalation                  of toxic fumes.  
         And there haven't been          any other intrusions                 in the firewall?     
No, ma'am.                       
     It appears the crisis           has been averted.            
Except that no one's been able     To explain how the firewall        break disengaged.            
        Not yet.                 
    The fbi has no idea how      it happened... It just happened. 
                 And that's not                   an explanation. 
Perhaps dubaku was firing             another warning shot.       
No, dubaku's already down                  two planes.            
        He's not afraid                to take more lives.        
         In any event,               we should be grateful.       
I'm not one to accept good news           Unless I know                where it comes from.        
  Until we have more answers,    I want to maintain alert levels. 
         (phone rings)                               Yes?         
    Madam president, I have        admiral smith on line two.     
    Put him through.             
        Thank you, tim.          
        Admiral?                 
I've been trying to reach agent  gedge, and he hasn't picked up.  
     Yes, I'm sure I have            the right number.            
      I just spoke to him            over an hour ago.            
He said he was outside           samantha roth's apartment        Waiting for the first gentleman. 
            (sighs)                      just find him.           
        I don't care who you             have to pull off shift.  
Still can't reach gedge.         
The secret service doesn't know        where he is either.        
            (sighs)               I need to tell the president.   
  Maybe you should hold off.     
  The domestic threat's been             lifted for now           And she's on the phone           with admiral smith.              
              I can't authorize                  the air strikes          Until our post-invasion              plans are in place.  
Finding a politically viable     replacement, until that happens, You need to keep                 your forces at full readiness.   
    The joint chiefs                 are getting impatient.       
Madam president, we need           to talk about your husband.    
          His theory                 about your son's death,      He hasn't let it go.             
  What are you talking about?    
      He's been harassing              roger's girlfriend,             Accusing her of complicity           in the death of roger.  
Henry and I went over it                         Again and again                    with the fbi,               And he swore to me       He was past all that.       
  Well, he's found a private       investigator who's feeding         His conspiracy theory;                   Taking advantage                             of him.  
            Please get henry                       on the phone.  
I'm afraid                       I can't do that.                 
     Henry's unreachable.        
      I don't understand.        
    Agent gedge hasn't been           answering his phone.        
            Now, I wouldn't get              too worried yet.     
You're telling me my husband's            gone missing?           
        Secret service                 has put out an apb.        
            They're going to               ms. Roth's apartment.  
         Whatever's going on, I       will find out soon enough.  
  Secret service dispatcher:      this is a priority order code        charlie zero charlie.       
    We need an immediate 20              on agent gedge.          
         All available                field agents proceed          To his last known location:         404 wilkinson drive.        
        I repeat:                  code charlie zero charlie.     
        (phone ringing)                (ringing continues)              (phone snaps shut)             (breathes deeply)            You're making a mistake.         
Think about it.                  
                    Shut up!     
You haven't killed               anybody yet.                     
    You don't need                     to do this.                
Gedge's plan to frame me             is already blown.            
If you kill me,                    They'll know it was murder,         And they'll trace it                 back to you.            
         (phone rings)                   Go ahead.                
     Where's agent gedge?        
      I can't reach him.         
        Gedge is dead.           
        What happened?           
     Everything was going             according to plan...        
But something                    went wrong.                      
Taylor killed gedge;             I don't know how.                
        Where's mr. Taylor now?  
He's right here.                 
        Don't kill him,              bring him to me.             
        Yes, sir.                
         Prime minister matobo,      ma'am, please come with me.  
Chloe, pull up the ritter        building on a satellite grid.    
Look for any sign of dubaku      leaving the site.                
We've got to find him.           
It's going to take me 20 minutes to task the satellite.           
     Then don't waste time           talking about it.            
              Pull up satellite                and traffic cams,                   Street corners              and metro stations.  
What's the priority?             
 I can only do one thing             at a time.                   
                      Satellite! 
      Fine.                      
Bill, we need to rethink this.   
              What do you mean?  
  You were set up to surveil     an undercover operation.         
Your cover's been blown.         
The police are after us.         
We are not equipped to look for  one man in a city of millions.   
We need additional               resources.                       
    What are you suggesting?     
        It's time                 to contact outside agencies.    
                The government?  
          Yes.                   
         I thought you said the  government couldn't be trusted.  
Right now,                       we don't have a choice.          
                    Almeida:             it can't be trusted.     
    We can't trust anybody,      That's why we're working                 on the outside.          
    President taylor                     can be trusted.          
            I'm not questioning            that, prime minister.  
It's the people around her       who can't be trusted.            
  Mr. Buchanan, jack's right.    
         We need help.           
      It's too dangerous.        
We can limit the flow            of information.                  
Prime minister matobo            can get us past                  The president's outer circle--   that way, we can at least        Explain to her                   why and what we're doing.        
Renee:                           I think jack's right.            
    We left a lot of clues           in that building.            
    We're vulnerable;                we can't do this                         On our own anymore.  
    Am I supposed to remain            in hiding with you,          Pretend that my wife and I             Are still being               held hostage or dead?       
    I need to return                   to the white house           And help the president save      what's left of my country.     
Let my husband do this.          
Let him call president taylor.   
    She will listen to him.      
Bill, you want to find           dubaku, make the call.           
          All right.             
    Get me the white house.      
Reporter: representatives              from boyd chemical         Have assured local authorities   That the immediate crisis                  has passed.            
 However, this has done little         to calm the nerves         Of the citizens of kidron, ohio, Many of whom have taken shelter    in neighboring communities.    
        Again, we have               confirmed one fatality       Inside the plant itself.         
13 others, all boyd employees,       Are being treated              at local medical centers...    
        (intercom beeps)                               yes?       
Madame president, I have prime   minister matobo calling for you. 
                Matobo?!         
          Yes, ma'am.            
             You're tracing it?  
  We tried, madame president,        but it's a secure line.      
            Put him through.     
             Prime minister?     
Yes, madame president.           
        Are you all right?       
      Thank god my wife and I              are both fine.         
    We were rescued.             
        By whom?                 
        Where are you?           
            In a safe place.     
        Madame president,            you need to listen to me.    
The people who rescued us, they  have acquired the cip device.    
    It has been destroyed,        And your country is no longer       under immediate threat.      
     Who are these people,       and tell me how this happened.   
  I will tell you everything               in person,                     But, uh,                   this must happen privately.    
  I must speak to you alone.     
          Why alone?             
They will bring me to you,       madame president.                
 We will arrive in ten minutes.  
I'll be waiting for you.         
 They tried to trace the call,         but the line held.         
Ethan, I need to see you                   right now.             
    Yes, madame president?       
         I just spoke            to prime minister matobo.        
            What?!               
          He's safe.             
      How? What happened?        
    He'll let us know                  when he gets here.         
He's on his way now.             
He wants a private meeting.      
         Bring him in              through the south entrance,             And keep this            to as few people as possible.   
          All right.             
Jack, I've mapped a route          for you to the white house.    
      It's mostly side streets,                But there will be              fewer traffic cams.  
          Okay, good.            
     Send it to my phone.        
We're ready. Let's go.           
 As soon as we set the vehicle   in front of the building,            Agent walker will move                 mr. Matobo.            
                  Jack... Jack!  
             What?               
        I'm not going.           
  What are you talking about?    
    If the government            gets their hands on tony,              They'll arrest him.        
        I already told you--     I did some pretty bad things     before I teamed up with bill.    
Tony, take it from me...         
     You need to deal with           the consequences.            
        And believe me, I will.  
                But not yet.     
        Not till we get dubaku.  
         I'm working on a lead.  
                 I've got a guy                on emerson's crew              Who might have some                intel we can use.  
Let him do this, jack.           
                He's the reason              we got this far.     
             Fine.               
But you give me your word        as soon as this as over,         You turn yourself in.            
We'll stand behind you.          
                     All right,                you have my word.  
Good luck. Be careful.           
        (keys jangling)                (knocking on door)                                 Hey.     
         Hey.                    
             I was on my way to               work, so I thought      I'd stop in and see you.     
I tried calling you earlier.     
          I'm sorry;                     I've been busy.          
      Are you all right?         
      You look exhausted.        
  It's just been a long day.     
      Well, I hope you're still          coming over for dinner.  
            I'm making lasagna.  
  And my sister promises not to   give you any more dirty looks.  
    You haven't forgotten,               have you?                
            No. No.              
    It's just that I've got        some business to attend to.    
  Samuel, you work too much.     
            Every time you come                  into the diner,      You're always on the phone.  
    I have to, maria,                So that, one day,              I can finally take you away         From that awful place           that you work in.            
         Well, we met                 in that awful place.        
             Don't forget that.  
             I'll see you later. 
Okay.                            
        (line ringing)                   Vossler:                         go ahead.                
Have you got mr. Taylor?         
             Yes.                
 I'm about three minutes away.   
    There's a korean grocer           opposite my building.       
         One of my men               will meet you out back.      
     Bring taylor inside.        
 What are you gonna do to him?   
        Just make sure                you weren't followed.

24 Season07 Episode01 Let the record show this is the third day of this senate hearing investigating human rights violations by the recently disbanded counter terrorist unit. 
Yesterday, when we adjourned, we were discussing brutality and torture by ctu agents in the course of their operations. 
Will the witness please state his name? 
Jack bauer. 
Mr. Bauer, I don't see 
your counsel present. 
Is he or she not aware that we're about to start? 
I have chosen not to retain counsel. 
Mr. Bauer, I have to advise you 
that many of the questions that we' about to pose to you are of a legal nature and might result in answers that could incriminate you. 
I understand that, senator. 
We can postpone your testimony until this afternoon if you'd like to bring in representation something that I would strongly advise. 
What is the first question, senator? 
All right, then. Let's begin. 
Mr. Bauer, who is ibrahim hadad? 
That information is classified. 
We represent the people of the united states, and we have declassified those files on their behalf. 
Now, I'm going to ask you one more time: Who is ibrahim hadad? 
He was a member of a terrorist sleeper cell ctu had under surveillance in 2002. 
And isn't it true that you detained mr. Hadad without due process, 
and that you used extreme interrogation methods on him until he answered your questions? 
Yes, sir. 
Would you say that you broke procedure with this interrogation? 
 Probably. 
 Probably? 
Well, that's A... very cavalier answer. 
You don't seem to care about the implications here. 
Well, mr. Bauer? 
I'm sorry, senator. I 
didn't hear a question. 
All right, then. 
Did you torture mr. Hadad? 
According to the definitions set forth by the geneva convention, yes, I did. 
Senator, why don't I save you some time. 
It's obvious that your agenda is to discredit ctu and generate a series of indictments. 
My only agenda is to get to the truth. 
I don't think it is, sir. 
Excuse me? 
Ibrahim hadad had targeted a bus carrying 45 people, ten of which were children. 
The truth, senator, is I stopped that attack from happening. 
By torturing mr. Hadad. 
By doing what I deemed necessary to protect innocent lives. 
So, basically, what you're saying, mr. Bauer, 
is that the ends justify the means, and that you are above the law. 
When I am activated, when I am brought into a situation, there is a reason. 
And that reason is to complete the objectives of my mission at all costs. 
Even if it means breaking the law? 
For a combat soldier, the difference between success and failure is your ability to adapt to your enemy. 
The people that I deal with they don't care about your rules. 
All they care about is a result. 
My job is to stop them from accomplishing their objectives. 
I simply adapted. 
In answer to your question, am I above the law? No, sir. 
I am more than willing to be judged by the people you claim to represent. 
I will let them decide what price I should pay. 
But please do not sit there with that smug look on your face and expect me to regret the decisions that I have made, because, sir, the truth is, I don'T. 
Excuse me, sir. 
sorry for interrupting, senator. 
I'm renee walker with the fbi. 
We have a subpoena for jack bauer. 
I need him remanded into my custody immediately. 
I'm not surprised that anyone has a subpoena for mr. Bauer, 
but right now, you're going to have to wait your turn. 
He's being questioned by the united states senate. 
Sir, we need mr. Bauer immediately. 
Well, apparently, we're going to have to let you go for w, but we're not done with you. 
We'll reconvene with you tomorrow morning at the same time. Is that understood? 
Yes, sir. 
All right. Then you go 
along with these agents. 
Well, let's proceed. 
Bailiff, call the next witness. 
What is this about? 
Mr. Bauer, I'm special agent 
walker. This is agent teller. 
We need you to come with us to our office. 
 It's just down the block. 
 Why? 
You'll be briefed when we get there. 
 Hello? 
 Janis, it's me. Where's larry? 
He's briefing dornan's group. 
Tell him I've got bauer, we're leaving the hearing now. 
Well, that's good, 'cause the situation's heating up. 
What are you talking about? 
That crew we've been tracking? 
They just grabbed a man named michael latham. 
Latham? He worked on 
homeland's firewall project. 
Oh, he didn't just work on it, he designed it. 
He's the chief engineer of the government's infrastructure security system. 
All right, I'll be there soon. 
Did you get bauer cleared through security yet? 
Not yet. 
Well, renee's bringing him in. 
They're only a couple minutes out. 
Then you won't need him cleared for a couple of minutes. 
 Sean, as a friend, I'd like to keep... 
 you're not my friend. 
Sure. 
As someone as close to a friend as you are ever going to get, let me give you some advice. 
Most people don't like sarcasm. 
I myself have no problem with it, 'cause I'm cheerful. 
I'm a cheerful person. 
You're a cheerful person? 
Just get bauer cleared. 
For the past eight weeks, this office has been investigating a series of technology thefts software, custom gate array chips, neural networks. 
Forensics concluded that the break-ins were the work of the same crew, but we didn't know what their end game was until now. 
This is michael latham. 
He's chief engineer on the classified infrastructure portal, homeland's firewall project. 
He was abducted ten minutes ago by the same group behind the technology thefts. 
You think they're using this guy latham to get through the cip firewall? 
That's our concern. 
The hardware they stole could be used to build a device to do just that. 
And latham's one of the few people that could do it. 
We assume he's being forced to work on the device, or that he's already dead. 
Excuse me-- renee's on her way in with jack bauer. 
Thank you. 
We've tasked your people to help this investigation. See sean. He's got the packets. 
We're on it. 
we're on line with gsa 117. 
How many systems? 
Communications, navigation... 
but we need the other systems working. Check on latham. 
all right... it's done. 
northeast three, this is global skies 117. 
We are ready for clearance. 
Gsa 117, roger. 
You're clear to jfk airport as filed. 
Maintain 5,000. 
Expect flight level of 280 ten minutes after departure. 
Cleared to jfk. Expect flight level 280. 
Welcome to global skies flight number 117, passenger service from reagan-national to jfk. 
Weather in new york is cloudy with a chance of thunder showers, so we may run into some turbulence along the way. 
Tower to skies, awaiting traffic off of dulles. 
Position hold, gsa 117. 
Gsa 117, that's correct. 
mr. Bauer? 
I'm agent larry moss. I'm 
the head of this office. 
You're here because agent walker thinks you might be able to help us with an investigation. 
Now, personally, I have my doubts, but I'll be happy to be proven wrong. 
Well, cky for me, I'm not here to apply for a job, agent moss. 
Personally, I don't care what makes you happy, so let's just get this over with. 
Take him to renee's office. 
Do you want me in the room with you? 
 No. 
 Renee... 
you've read his file. 
Bauer's the kind of guy you say the wrong thing, he can go off. 
I'll be fine, larry. 
If he goes off, I'll call you. 
All right, but if he doesn't produce, don't waste our time. Throw him back. 
What do you want? 
Mr. Bauer, we have a national 
security matter that has gone critical. 
I'm hoping you can help us with it. 
Please sit down. 
I sent the differentials to homeland. 
Was there anything else you needed me to do? 
No. 
Has bauer been indicted yet? 
No, but he will be after the senate hearings. 
The cip firewall protects every major infrastructure system in this country if it were breached, telecommunication, transportation, power grids they would all be vulnerable. 
 Agent walker, right? 
 Yes. 
I'm not active. 
The doj is about to file criminal charges against me; I'm not exactly in a position to help you with your situation. 
As much as I understand how dire it is... 
no, I don't think you do. 
One of the men behind this threat... 
is someone you know. 
That's not possible. 
Tony almeida is dead. 
 Apparently not. 
 I was there when he died. 
And he was rushed away by the emts a minute later. 
You never saw him after that, and hours later you were abducted by the chinese government. 
No. No. 
If tony were still alive, I would know. He would have contacted me. 
We recovered this image from a security camera where one of the technology thefts took place. 
It's time-stamped and dated. 
Images can be manipulated. 
Not this one. 
I'm sorry, I don't believe it. 
I had almeida's grave exhumed. 
Dna tests confirmed that it was not his body that was buried. 
The evidence is right here. 
If you want to leave without looking at it, go ahead. 
Gsa 117 on a roll. 
Masters? 
Yes,sir. 
Are we in their system? 
Yes. 
Roger tower,gsa 117,switching to departure 126.8 
Have a good day. 
What's the problem? 
The cip module it stopped working. 
What do you mean it stopped? 
It keeps going out of phase. 
I thought latham said it was good to go. 
Well,it's not. 
All right,let me have it. 
So what did you do? 
I didn't do anything. 
I swear. 
Then why isn't it working? 
I don't know. 
Fix it. 
Now. 
you're gonna want to move faster than that. 
See,'cause if you can't make this work in the next few minutes,I won't need you anymore. 
You understand what that means? 
Good. 
Now fix it. 
Officials say that an estimated 300,000 civilians men,women,and children have been killed as part of general benjamin juma's campaign of ethnic cleansing. 
Survivors in the african nation of sangala, believe american intervention is necessary to prevent further bloodshed. 
The white house has made no public statements... 
juma's perpetrating the worst mass murder africa has seen since rwanda. 
But if you read the columns... 
I do. 
Half of them are against our taking action. 
But if we don'T... 
six months from now,those same members of the press will be accusing us of moral bankruptcy. 
We can always revisit the un option. 
The un's paralyzed,ethan,while people are being butchered by that madman. 
We have to lead. 
Even if it means going it alone. 
I'm not gonna have hundreds of thousands of lives on my conscience. 
General juma has to be stopped. 
He will be,madame president. 
As soon as you give the order. 
Are the joint chiefs here yet? 
They're gathering in the situation room. 
They'll call as soon as they're ready for you. 
I just heard kevin aldrich is doing a piece for cnb. 
He's still pressing his case against sending our troops in. 
As if getting through this day won't be hard enough. 
If you want,I can sit down with him and try to get him to hold off; he's in the press room. 
I'm not sure that's a good idea,henry. 
This is the last thing you need right now,especially with public opinion so split. 
if you think you can talk aldrich down,do it. 
Madame president,the joint chiefs are ready. 
Here's your briefing package. 
Wish me luck. 
Good luck. 
Is this everything? 
It's all there. 
I don't mean to sound like a broken record, but I'm not sure your husband is up to handling aldrich. 
Henry's fine. 
He's better,I realize that,but... 
it's going to take more than a few months. 
He lost a son. 
So did you. 
And you haven't let your loss interfere with your job. 
Your husband is a strong man,but he doesn't have your resilience. 
It's not a matter of resilience,ethan. 
There's not a day that goes by,not a moment when i don't think about my son. 
But I'm about to take this nation to war and grief is a luxury I can't afford right now. 
Before we begin,let me thank each of you for the time and work you've put into this operation. 
Putting american lives at risk is the hardest decision I've ever had to make... 
but it is one that has to be made. 
what was that? 
It's working. 
What was wrong? 
It was overheating. I 
came up with a workaround. 
Try it now. 
There. 
Yeah. 
It's transmitting again. 
We can send and receive. 
Double a-123 maintain course. 
What was that? 
I just got it,too. 
Yeah. I did,but we're back up now. 
No,I'm good. 
No,I'm fine. 
What's going on,phil? 
This is gonna sound crazy,but the three of us just got bumped for a second. 
But the log file doesn't show a power surge. 
This came from the system kernel. 
What are you talking about? 
The kernel's protected. 
Let me have a look. 
All we know for sure is that almeida is part of a homegrown terrorist group that's targeting our infrastructure. 
He could be working undercover,some kind of sting operation. 
You need to check every federal agency we have. State and city,too. 
Almeida's not working for any of them. 
Then there must be some other explanation. 
Yeah,there is. 
His wife was brutally murdered by a faction operating inside the government,led by the president himself. 
Everybody involved in that is either in prison or has been killed. 
The government gave president logan a slap on the wrist,they cut him a deal. 
Sentencing him to house arrest on a hundred-acre ranch... 
And you think tony's looking for justice by attacking this country? 
Almeida lost everything he had,and he's blaming it on the government he spent his life serving. 
But you'd know better than me how that feels... 
how far a man might go. 
Not that far. 
And not tony almeida. 
There's a logical explanation for this. 
It's just something you're not seeing. 
Help me find almeida and you can ask him yourself. 
You know how he thinks. 
You had the same training. 
You know the same people. 
I'm going to need complete access to all of your source material everything you've got on this. 
yes? 
Renee,come out here. 
Something just came in. 
Be right there. 
Everything we have on almeida's crew is in this directory. 
Start here... 
I'll be right back. 
What's going on? 
Northeast air traffic control just called. 
They reported a possible intrusion into their communication systems. 
It just happened. 
Can th source them? 
They're trying,but so far,nothing. 
Why do we think this has to do with almeida's crew? 
I don't think you get intrusions like this unless someone's driving it, and the only way to drive it is through the cip firewall. 
So they're going after air traffic control. 
That's what it looks like. 
Put me through to the white house. 
You doing a turnaround in new york? 
Nope. Got two days off. 
I'm meeting my boyfriend in the city. 
Oh,that'll be fun. 
well,doug said we were going to hit some weather. 
I'm going to need tech support to cross-reference your files. 
You'll be working with one of my analysts,sean hillinger. 
He can get you whatever files you need to help us find almeida. 
Good. 
They raise the threat level yet? 
yeah. We think almeida's gup 
got into air traffic control. 
What? 
That doesn't make sense. 
I don't need you to figure it out,jack. 
Just help me find him. 
Sean,this is jack bauer. 
He's going to be working with the almeida files. 
Give him whatever he needs. 
What about interfacing with faa? 
Janis is working with some of dornan's people on that. 
You just help jack. 
Fine. 
I'll check in. 
Thanks. 
What do you want to see? 
Let's start with the technology thefts. 
How many were there? 
Six. 
Let's run a comp on all of them. 
Fantastic. 
The expeditionary strike force and its carrier air wing are now on scene. 
This gives us full spectrum dominance of the battle space. 
What kind of resistance are you anticipating from juma's military? 
Minimal. 
Our air strikes will take out whatever defenses they've got. 
We can expect an open path to juma's front door. 
Good. 
All we need to launch is a go order from you. 
You'll get a green light as soon as I've gone over secretary stevens' post-invasion report, which I'm still waiting for. 
I'll have it for you in a few minutes,ma'am. 
Unless there's a problem you'd like to discuss. 
Madame president,my objection to this operation isn't a secret to anyone in this room. 
For us to be wading into the middle of another civil conflict halfway around the world... 
we're done debating this,joe. 
The un's been issuing reprimands and economic sanctions while benjamin juma has slaughtered over 200,000 of his own people. 
That number will continue to grow if we don't stop him now. 
And if you can't get behind what we're doing,I'll find a secretary of state who can. 
But I am done with your handwringing. 
Excuse me,madame president. 
Tim woods from homeland security is outside. 
He needs to see you on another matter. 
Can it wait? 
No,ma'am,it can'T. 
All right. 
We'll continue when I return. 
And,joe,I want that report in front of me when I get back. 
What is it? 
I don't have the details,but it involves a potential domestic breach. 
Tim is here to fill us in. 
Madame president. 
Tim,make this brief; the joint chiefs are waiting. 
We've been working with the fbi the last eight weeks, investigating a series of technology thefts. 
We didn't understand the implications of this until today. 
The same people behind these thefts abducted a man named michael latham. 
He's one of the chief engineers in charge of protecting critical infrastructure. 
Now,tell me what we're dealing with. 
The fbi thinks these same people have forced latham to create a device to hack through the cip firewall. 
The firewall protects all national systems: Energy,utilities,transportation... 
I'm here because the faa reported some irregularities in their air traffic control system. 
Are you saying commercial flights are in danger? 
Possibly. 
Do I need to give the order to ground air traffic? 
I'm afraid it's not that simple. 
Right now,there are more than 3,000 flights over the continental united states. 
To ground them all would take 12 hours,minimum,and it could create a panic. 
Then what do you recommend? 
Let us quietly decrease air traffic while the bureau works their leads. 
We'll make sure you're briefed on a real-time basis. 
I don't like the timing of this... 
timing? 
Could this be connected to our intervention in sangala? 
The fbi hasn't found any connection. 
All the evidence suggests that we're dealing with a domestic terror group, homegrown,with a strong,anti-government bias. 
And these leads you mentioned do you think you'll be able to catch these people before they do any real damage? 
The bureau's got everyone on it,ma'am. 
You didn't answer my question. 
No,ma'am. I didn'T. 
Of course,I don't condone what juma's doing over there. 
But tribal wars are being fought all over the world. 
Why not intervene in thailand,malaysia? 
This isn't a tribal war,kevin. 
It's a genocide. 
Ending it is the moral obligation of a nation as powerful as ours. 
That's a lofty aspiration,but the reality is a lot more complex. 
The president's going into this with both eyes open. 
How can she be sure thcycle of violence won't coinue after juma's been taken out? 
Could be stuck there indefinitely...keeping the peace. 
If I gave you an exclusive preview of the president's post-invasion plans,you might change your mind. 
You're trying to bribe me with an exclusive? 
I'm trying to get you to give us some rope. 
What are you asking me to do,stop writing or write what I don't believe? 
Either one would be fine with me. 
Sir,you have a phone call on your private line. 
Could you excuse me for a moment,please,kevin. 
It's chuck toland,sir. 
Wait. 
Chuck,did you find something? 
I did,but don't get carried away. 
It doesn't confirm your theory about how roger died. 
But it is suspicious. 
I'm listening. 
His girlfriend samantha received a large lump-sum deposit in an off-shore bank account about three days after roger's suicide. 
You mean his alleged suicide. 
Right,sir. 
Where did the money come from? 
I couldn't tell. 
It looks like it's been washed. 
There's no readily identifiable source. 
So...what does this mean? 
All it means is that she suddenly came into $400,000. 
If we're going to find out anything more,I'm going to need to talk to her personally. 
Is that how you want me to handle it? 
no, If she's got anything to hide,she's not going to talk to a private investigator. 
I agree. 
So how do you want me to proceed? 
I'll talk to her myself. 
Is she still at that brokerage firm? 
Yeah,uh,sloane kittridge. 
Good. 
I'm going to finish up here with aldrich. 
Then I need you to take me somewhere,and keep it off the manifest. 
I don't want anyone to know where we're going. 
Yes,sir. 
Agent gedge. 
Yes,sir. 
You think chuck's taking advantage of me,don't you? 
It's not my place to say that,sir. 
I'm asking you anyway. 
Sir,the police and fbi have both investigated your son's death. 
And yes,I believe this pi could be exploiting your grief for personal gain. 
These so-called leads that he's generating have led nowhere. 
My son didn't kill himself. 
I'm sure of it. 
Yes,sir. 
Can you check that socket again,please? 
Has faa reported any more anomalies? 
Not since the first three. 
Maybe it was just a glitch? 
Or it could have been a ripple caused when they broke through the firewall and entered the system. 
Well,if they're in the system,I can't see them,and I've checked every elr socket. 
Keep looking. 
Renee... 
uh,what's going to happen? 
What do you mean? 
If almeida has broken through the firewall then we're screwed,right? 
I mean,crashing couple planes is really nothing compared to contaminating the water system or bringing down the power grid... 
don't think about it,janis. 
Just stay tasK. 
okay,so... 
I will just stay calm,right? 
Yeah. 
Pull up the second one. 
You already looked at it. 
I want to look at it again,pull it up. 
Have you found anything? 
No,we keep looking at the same six forensic reports over and over. 
What are you looking for,jack? 
An entry point. 
They had access cards. 
Yeah,but no one reported their access cards stolen,which means they were forged. 
So... 
These access cards have individual signatures,making them almost impossible to forge. 
There's only a couple guys who can do it. 
Can you access old ctu files? 
Sure. 
Pull up august 1999. 
Code name: Hatteras. 
Just got a call from homeland. 
They briefed the president but she's not ready to ground planes yet. 
Here you go.Hatteras file. 
You know,you can hire a $14.00-an-hour data applications geek to do this; 
you don't need me. 
I wouldn't advertise that. 
There he is-- gabriel schector. 
Who is he? 
He was a supplier. 
Tony and I used him to buy things off-book. 
See if he's in your database. 
Yeah.He's there. 
Is he still in los angeles? 
No.According to this earmark,he came to dc nine weeks ago. 
The thefts started a week after that. 
That's your guy. 
Do you have an address? 
He's subletting an office downtown-- 1208 naylor road,suite 630. 
All right,put a field team together,pick him up. 
I'll call judge simons,have a warrant ready. 
That's a mistake. 
Why? 
You don't have time to go through the motions with schector you serve him with a warrant,he'll call his lawyers,he'll stall as long as he needs. 
So,what's the alternative,jack? 
Break in and torture the guy,like you used to do? 
Isn't that how you ended up in front of a senate sub-committee? 
Oh,is this how it starts? 
You get in my face,tighten your jaw,then if I say something you don't like, you slam me against the wall. 
You have no idea what I do. 
And last time I checked,you subpoenaed me. 
You want my help,you want my advice,take it. 
You don't,don'T. 
I don't care. 
Mr. Bauer... 
you said you used to work with this man schector. 
How well does he know you? 
He knows me. 
Larry,can I talk to you for a second? 
I want to take ber with me. 
No. 
Forget it.I'm not letting him put his hands on a suspect. 
He won't need to put his hands on anybody. 
My guess is if he's in the room,schector will talk. 
Renee,you saw what he just... 
I'm trying to find almeida before it's too late, and schector is our best lead. 
So you want to intimidate him wi bauer? 
Schector knows how far bauer might go. 
Let's use that. 
Yeah,and if schector doesn't blink,then what? 
I'll keep bauer on a short leash. 
Renee,we're the fbi,not ctu. 
We honor the law. 
Even when it's not convenient. 
Look,this situation is heating up fast,larry. 
The president's into it now,and she's expecting results. 
Yeah,I know. 
It's your call. 
But I promise you,can handle bauer. 
All right. 
But I'm holding you responsible. 
And I'm sending backup teams. 
Jack. 
You're coming with me,and you're doing this my way. 
Tell me about schector. 
Out of san diego,till he went on his own. 
Legitimate? 
Yeah,at first,then he got greedy. 
Started using his connections to acquire technology,sell it on the gray market. 
Who'd he sell to,terrorists? 
No.Usually foreign governments trying to get around treaties. 
And how did you and tony get involved with him? 
We arrested him,we turned him. 
He was a great conduit for intel. 
Ctu didn't mind that you were letting this guy stay in business? 
Ctu didn't know. 
It was just tony and me. 
So you and tony were tight? 
Yeah... 
yeah,we were close. 
All right,so it sounds like tony,who everyone thinks is dead, puts together a plan to hijack american security. 
He contacts schector to help him with this plan. 
Yeah. 
Except you don't believe it. 
That tony's dirty. 
I believe that tony's alive. 
And I believe he's doing something dangerous,and that we need to find him. 
We confirmed schector's inside. 
How do you want to handle this? 
I'm going in with bauer. 
Alone? 
I want schector to talk. 
I don't want to spook him. 
Call me when backup gets here. 
Matobo's fighters are hidden outside the capitol in three camps. 
Alpha,beta and delta. 
Our ground forces will join up with them once the air strikes are completed. 
Make sure general wagner understands our priority is to maintain order in the streets. 
The people need to see that their country's being governed under the rule of law. 
What happens when matobo's men execute general juma without a trial? 
Should we intervene or let the mob tear them apart? 
I'm meeting with mr. Matobo in a few minutes. 
I'll make sure he keeps his men in line. 
And,joe,I was wrong to dress you down in front of the joint chiefs. 
I'm sorry. 
No need to apologize,madame president. 
You're under a lot of pressure. 
That's still no excuse. 
Thank yo ma'am,I appreciate that. 
The fact remains,if you can't get behind this operation with both shoulders, I will need your resignation. 
That won't be necessary,ma'am. 
Whatever doubts I have,I'll keep them to myself. 
Good. 
Excuse me,madame president. 
What is it,ethan? 
I thought you'd want to know,henry aldrich has agreed to delay his broadcast for 24 hours. 
Henry's doing? 
I,uh,underestimated him. 
Letting him intervene was the right call. 
Well,that's some good news. 
What about the firewall situation? 
Has the fbi made any progress? 
They've identified a man who may have information. 
They're about to question him. 
It's more than likely schector's not going to give you this information easily. 
Just remember,this is an fbi operation. 
We work within the confines of the law. 
You can threaten him,but do not lay hands on him. 
The minute I see you crossing that line,I will pull you back,understood? 
Understood. 
Agent walker,fbi. 
I'm here to talk to gabriel schector. 
Just a second. 
Can I help you? 
Jack bauer? 
How are you,gabe? 
Didn't know you were fbi. 
I'm not. 
Just came along for the ride. 
Mr. Bauer is here under my authority. 
Oh,so I can hold you responsible for anything he does while he's here. 
I have a witness. 
Sure. 
Okay. 
Come on in. 
Please. 
Have a seat. 
this should be an interesting conversation. 
How long's it been,jack? 
Years. 
How's the,uh... 
senate thing doing? 
I hear they dismantled the ctu. 
Don't tell me. 
It was your fault,wasn't it? 
Mr. Schector,we're not here to make small talk. 
I have questions. 
Well,you have my undivided attention. 
Where's tony almeida? 
Tony almeida? 
In the ground,I spose. 
Unless he was cremated. 
Didn't he die at ctu a while back? 
You got an out here,gabe. 
They're not after you. 
They're willing to accept that you didn't know what tony almeidaas going to do with the components that y helped him steal. 
Nobody I knew stole anything,and if they did,I knew nothing about it. 
This is far more serious than you know,mr. Schector. 
If you help us find almeida,I can see to it that you're kept in the clear. 
Otherwise,you could be a co-conspirator to multiple terrorist acts. 
No,well,I think this conversation is over. 
I tried to answer all your questions honestly, but I think,from now on,you can speak to my lawyers. 
So,good-bye,jack. 
And good luck with the senate. 
Hope they fry your ass. 
Ari,could you show these people to the door,please. 
Are you sure you want to play it like this? 
Yeah,that's the way I want to play,jack. 
Drop your weapon. 
Drop it now! 
Okay,okay,okay. 
You two are going to prison! 
This was unprovoked! 
Unprovoked! 
Your man ari was going for his gun-- I've got a witness. 
Why don't we try having this conversation again. 
Where is tony almeida? 
No. 
I'm not talking to you. 
Where is he? 
Tony almeida's dead. 
What do you want me to do? 
This is your call. 
Do whatever it takes. 
This is against the law. 
You can't do this. 
I'm gonna enjoy this. 
Enjoy what? 
All right,all right! 
I'll tell you what I know! 
There's no need for me to lose my good looks over this. 
okay. 
Last time I saw almeida... 
are you all right? 
Yeah. 
Tell your men they've got a shooter on top of the columbia building,heading south. 
Shots fired.Suspects are down. 
The shooter's on the roof of the columbia building across the street. 
Seal all exits. 
Get away from this,jack. 
Tony? 
There's nothing you or the fbi can do about this. 
Just stay away. 
Tony,just talk to me. 
What the hell's going... 
tony... 
tony! 
What's going on at schector's office? 
I don't know.They haven't checked in yet. 
Gsa 117,northeast three,descend pilot's discretion,direct jfk. 
Northeast three,roger,we're starting our descent now. 
Gsa 117,descend and maintain 2,000,expect holding runway four-right. 
Gsa 117,I did not receive your read-back. 
Acknowledge.Over. 
Gsa 117,acknowledge. 
Mr. Paulson,I've lost comm with gsa 117. 
Try the emergency channels. 
I did. 
Nothing. 
And there's no fault on my board. 
I redirected twice. 
Something's interfering with our comm. 
Call back fbi! 
Tell them we have a 767 on approach no longer under our control! 
Gsa 117,acknowledge. 
Gsa 117,this is northeast three. 
Go ahead,air traffic control. 
Advise passing 7,000,maintain 1,500. 
Traffic ahead reporting moderate turbulence. 
Should be a smoother ride for you down there. 
Roger that,northeast three. 
Understand,northeast three,gsa 117. 
Enter descent for 1,500. 
All right. 
Get ready to make the course change. 
We're really taking this all the way. 
You just need to do exactly what I tell you to do. 
 The following takes place between 7:;00 a.m. And 8:;00 a.m. 
Tell me if you need more people on this, and I will get them for you. 
We don't need people. We need to get lucky. 
The transmitter node on the laptop is encrypted with multiple relays. 
Can you source the transmission or not? 
I'm trying to come up with a work-around. 
 Call me as soon as you have something. 
 I will. 
 They still can't source the transmission? 
 They're working on it. 
Chloe and Janis are doing everything they can. 
Is there no other lead, no other way to fiind my father? 
This is a good lead, Kim. 
The only reason we have it is 'cause of you. 
Yeah, except my father is dying, and we don't know how much time he has left. 
No! 
 Come in. 
  What are you still doing here? 
Just fiinishing up the conversation we started. 
Aaron, I told you to escort Ethan to the gate. 
Now take him out of my offiice and off the White House grounds. 
No, ma'am. I am not gonna do that. 
I'm calling security. 
 Having me dig up dirt on Noah Daniels is one thing. 
This is a whole different animal. 
I'm aware of that, Martin. 
 I want this to happen. I want 
this person taken care of. 
  Mmhmm. 
It's Jonas Hodges. 
The digital card you confiiscated from me was blank. 
I gave the real one to Agent Pierce. 
How long have you known, Aaron? 
I had my suspicions, ma'am... 
but I was hoping I was wrong. 
I'll wait outside, sir. 
Ethan, this doesn't tell the whole story. 
Sounds pretty clear to me. 
Hodges is dead. You're responsible. 
I know, but I tried to stop it from happening. 
Oh, save it, Olivia. 
You can't talk your way out of this situation. Not this time. 
All right, Ethan. 
You win. 
I'll resign. Come up with some excuse. 
You could have your job again. 
Everything will go This isn't about getting my job back! 
It's about the truth. 
The truth could destroy my mother's administration. 
I am fully aware of the implications if this goes public. 
You don't have to spell them out for me. 
Then what do you want? 
For the president to take the next step. 
Whether she decides to prosecute this or bury it, that's her call. 
But she needs to know the truth. 
I'll let you tell her yourself. 
I can't believe you're doing this. 
You're betraying everything that you've ever worked for. 
I know you think this country failed you... 
and I don't care what kind of ideology you believe in now. 
This is no way to fiight for it. What you're doing 
is wrong. This is wrong, and you know it! 
Damn it, Tony. Look at me. 
Please... 
as someone who was once your friend... 
let me die in peace. 
Don't let them use me to kill innocent people. 
I have no intention of letting them use you as a pathogen, Jack. 
 I never did. 
 I overheard you. 
This was your idea. You sold it to them. 
It was just a play. 
 A play? 
 To get the man who's coming here right now. 
Took me three years to fiind him. 
Took me another year to get him to meet me face-to-face. 
I had to prove myself to him by taking down Jonas Hodges. 
I had to convince him that I was a true believer in his cause. 
What the hell are you talking about? 
His name is Alan Wilson. 
He was the man behind Charles Logan. 
He's the one who ordered the hit on David Palmer. 
And he had Michelle killed to cover his tracks. 
This is the man who murdered my wife, Jack. 
Everything that you've done today is for personal revenge? 
It's about justice. 
Justice? 
You killed innocent people, Tony! 
Ten times as many people would have died if it hadn't have been for me. 
The deeper I dug to fiind the person responsible for Michelle's death... 
the more I kept running into men likeJonas Hodges. 
They're the ones with the crazy ideology, Jack, not me. 
I'm the one who had a plan to bring them down. 
I'd enlisted Bill and Chloe to help me track all the elements of this group. 
And when I fiinally got what I wanted... 
they would turn 'em in and shut 'em down. 
But you screwed that all up, didn't you, Jack? 
You see... 
I'm the one who saved lives today, Jack, not you. 
I'm the one who helped you recover the C.I.P. Device. 
I'm the one who warned you about the White House attacks! 
I'm the one who stopped Jonas Hodges from launching those missiles! 
You tell yourself whatever you want. 
You launched a biological attack on Washington Center Station... 
and if we hadn't gotten there in time, thousands of innocent people would have been killed! 
I did what I had to do to get Alan Wilson there. 
And now... 
he's gonna die. 
You kill him, and no one will ever know... 
the full extent of this conspiracy. 
I'm not gonna kill him, Jack. 
You are. 
Damn you, Tony. Damn you. 
I'm sorry that it has to be you. 
But the truth is, they wouldn't let me within 50 feet of the guy. 
You're the one he's coming for. 
You're not honoring Michelle's life. 
You are reveling in her death, and she would despise you for this. 
We're clear. 
 When's Wilson coming? 
 Soon. 
 He wants to see Bauer's medical record. 
 It's right over there. 
Wilson doesn't know about us. 
And it's best to keep it that way, at least for now. 
Sure. 
I understand. 
He's here. 
 You ready? 
 Yeah. 
Let's go. 
In Distance] Put your hands behind your head. 
We're all clear, sir. 
Go ahead. 
That's far enough for you. 
Hello... 
Cara. 
This is Tony Almeida. 
 Been looking forward to this, sir. 
 Yes, I know. 
Where's Bauer? 
Right inside, second door on the right. 
   You'll need this. 
So, Cara... 
thinks you should be playing a larger role in our organization. 
 You've been an asset. 
 Thank you, sir... 
but I believe there's a lot more I can bring to the table. 
But fiirst I want to see Bauer's pathology report. 
I have it right here. 
This is the F.B.I. You're surrounded. 
 Lay down your weapons. 
 Fire at will! 
Tony! 
Set us down. 
I need you to get me to that green vehicle. 
       Jack. 
Stay away from me. 
I'm wired with C-4. Tony's got the detonator. 
 Stay away! 
 Wait. I know this trigger mechanism. 
 I can disarm it. 
   Where's Kim? 
 She's safe. 
She was the reason we were able to fiind you. 
Tony's been playing both sides all along. 
You need to stop him. 
He's trying to kill the man who's behind this conspiracy. His name is Alan Wilson. 
He was responsible for killing Tony's wife, Michelle. That's why he's doing this. 
You want to end this for good, you need to stop Tony from killing him... 
otherwise you're gonna lose any chance of exposing the others. 
   Okay. You're clear. 
Let's go. 
It's the Woodside Industrial Complex. 
We're in the southeast quadrant, on our way to the perimeter. 
Call me when you have an exfiiltration point. 
How did this happen? Huh? 
 How did they track us? 
 I don't know. 
Tony! 
Thank God you're okay. 
The extraction team will be here soon, but we gotta move. 
It took me a long time to fiind you... 
to peel back all the layers of people you hide behind. 
But I stayed patient. 
'Cause ever since the day you had her killed... 
the only thing that kept me alive... 
was this moment right here. 
Hmm. You sound like you were involved 
in some kind of a tragedy... 
but I had nothing to do with it. 
Oh, no, no, no. No. 
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. 
See, Michelle and me... 
had gotten out of all this. 
We made it out together. 
And we were gonna start a whole new life... 
until you came along... 
and took it all away... 
in a split second. 
It wasn't just my wife you murdered. 
She was carrying my son. 
You killed my son! My son! 
And now... 
I'm gonna kill you. 
Tony, don't move. 
Tony, don't move! 
 Get him out of here. 
  These people think they can take everything away from us, Jack! 
Somebody had to stop 'em. 
And what did you do, huh? 
You ran away! 
That's right! You ran away, Jack! 
You're one of them now! 
Congratulations! 
How would Teri feel about that, huh, Jack? Huh? 
    A lot of people died today because of you... 
including someone close to me. 
You will be charged with treason... 
and conspiracy to launch terrorist attacks against this country. 
The only way that I see you avoiding the death penalty is by cooperating. 
Tell me who else is involved in this conspiracy... 
and I will make sure that your cooperation is taken into account by the grand jury. 
Hmm. 
How can I cooperate if I have no idea what you're talking about? 
That's not gonna work, Wilson. 
Whatever this conspiracy is that you think that I'm a part of... 
I guarantee you won't fiind a shred of material evidence connecting me to it. 
In the eyes of the law, I'm an innocent man. 
You son of a bitch. 
Anything else you need to say, you can say to my attorneys. 
Ma'am, they're almost ready to take Bauer to the hospital. You wanted a heads-up. 
Hmm. Hmm. 
I'm giving you hydromorphone to make the ride to the hospital easier. 
It'll make you a little sleepy, but it will break the pain cycle. 
No. Not yet. Please. 
Jack. 
Could you give us a moment? 
Dr. Macer wants you at the hospital. 
It's all right. She can wait. 
Thank you. 
What happened? 
He's denying everything. 
Claims that we don't have a case against him. 
Is he right? 
Maybe-which means he has absolutely no reason... 
to tell us who else is involved in this with him. 
But I can make him talk. 
If we don't fiind these people, one day they will launch another attack... 
and I don't see how I can live with myself... 
knowing that there was something I could have done to stop it. 
I don't know what to do. 
I can't tell you what to do. 
I've been wrestling with this one my whole life. 
L- I see 15 people held hostage on a bus, and everything else goes out the window. 
I will do whatever it takes to save them- and I mean whatever it takes. 
I guess maybe I thought... 
if I save them... 
I could save myself. 
Do you regret anything that you did today? 
No. 
But then again, I don't work for the F.B.I. 
I don't understand. 
You took an oath. 
You made a promise to uphold the law. 
When you cross that line, it always starts off with a small step. 
Before you know it, you're running as fast as you can in the wrong direction... 
just to justify what you started in the fiirst place. 
These laws were written by much smarter men than me. 
And in the end, I know that these laws... 
have to be more important than the 15 people on the bus. 
I know that's right. In my mind... 
I know that's right. 
L-I just don't think my heart could ever have lived with that. 
I guess the only advice I can give you is... 
try to make choices that you can live with. 
I don't know what to say. 
Don't say anything at all. 
Mr. Bauer, we really need to go. 
Henry! What are you doing out of bed? 
 What's going on? 
 Olivia wouldn't say until you got here. 
You'll understand when I tell you. 
It's gonna be hard enough to say once. 
I'm listening, Livy. What's this about? 
Jonas Hodges. 
He's dead because of me. 
Oh, Livy. 
Don't tell me you were the one who leaked the information. 
It's worse than that. 
Olivia... 
talk to us. 
He killed Roger. 
Hodges killed my brother... 
and then you agreed to put him into witness protection. 
And the thought ofhim getting away was too much for me. 
So I called Martin Collier. 
He had once told me he knew someone... 
who could do this kind of thing. 
You're saying Collier hired someone to killJonas Hodges? 
No. 
I did. 
I tried calling it off, but it was too late, and everything was happening so fast. 
Olivia, who else knows about this? 
Ethan. 
He has a recording of my conversation with Martin. 
He's agreed not to turn it over to the Attorney General. 
He says he'll respect whatever you decide to do with the evidence. 
 Mom, say something. 
 How could you do this, Olivia? 
How could you do something so stupid? 
I'm sorry. 
I tried to call it off. I swear. 
It doesn't matter, darling. It happened. 
For God's sake, Allison. Stop yelling at her. 
 Hodges killed our son. 
 I know what he did. 
Then you know, if anyone deserves to die, it's him. 
All you should be thinking about now is how to protect our daughter. 
Protect her? How? 
Destroy that recording. 
And cover up a murder? 
Henry, I can't just disregard the law. 
Allison, spare me your sanctimony. 
You're Olivia's mother. 
I'm also the president of the United States. 
And our family's already paid a steep enough price for that. 
What are you saying, Henry? 
You know exactly what I'm saying. 
Your job cost our son his life. 
That is a cruel thing to say. 
I couldn't have done anything to prevent Roger's death. 
But you can do something about this. 
For God's sakes, Allison. 
We've already lost one child. 
I'm sorry to interrupt, Madam President, but there's some news... 
from the Bureau you need to hear. 
Uh, good news. 
I'll be down in a moment, Tim. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Go, Allison. 
But so help me... 
destroy that recording... 
and save what's left of this family. 
Go. 
Dad, what did I do? 
We're going to fiigure this out. 
I'm sorry. 
We'll fiigure it out. 
He's a high-value suspect. 
Make sure you restrict access until I get there. 
Agent Walker's bringing him back now. 
 What's their E.T. A? 
 About 10 minutes. 
I'll be there in 20. 
Have Wilson's transfer papers in order by then. 
 Yes, sir. 
  Excuse me. Chloe. 
I've gotta work on Wilson's transfer papers... 
so we're gonna have to schedule debriefiing for later. 
 I can come back later, or tomorrow. 
 You staying in town? 
I want to be here forJack. 
I'd like to thank you for all the help you gave me today. 
Yeah. It was interesting. 
Given what you have to work with, uh, you're doing a pretty good job. 
I'll take that as a compliment. Thank you. 
Good. That's what it was meant to be. 
Because the pathogen was weaponized, the disease is at an advanced stage. 
I'm sorry, Mr. Bauer. 
All I can do is administer morphine... 
which will induce a coma. 
 But you won't feel any pain. 
 No morphine. Not yet, please. 
Excuse me, Dr. Macer. 
Mr. Bauer has a visitor. 
Yeah. It's all right. 
He'll see you now. 
I'll be outside. 
Thank you for coming. 
I was surprised to get your call. 
I'm dying. 
I know. 
I made so many mistakes. 
A-And I always thought that I would have the time to correct them. 
You have the time. Right now. 
You don't know what I've done. 
We live in complex times, Mr. Bauer. 
Nothing is black-and-white. 
But I do know this: I see before me a man... 
with all his flaws... 
and all his goodness. 
Simply a man. 
Let us both forgive ourselves for all the wrongs that we have done. 
Thank you. 
It's time. 
Olivia, come and sit down. 
No, I can't. 
I never imagined that this job would would be so hard on both of you. 
I had no idea of the price this family would pay. 
And for that, I am so sorry. 
But I have a sworn duty... 
to enforce the Constitution. 
Failing to honor that oath... 
would be the worst kind ofhypocrisy. 
Olivia, I love you more than anything in this world... 
and I will do everything I can to help you through this... 
but as president, this is what I have to do... 
no matter how much it breaks my heart. 
Agent Pierce will remand you to federal custody. 
Ma'am, I'm escorting you to theJustice Department... 
where you'll be held until formal charges... 
have been issued. 
I'm sorry, honey. 
Henry. 
Allison. 
Um... 
 if you'd like to talk later  No. 
As much as I wanted to cover this up, l I couldn't. 
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Madam President. 
 I understand completely. 
 Henry doesn't. 
He'll come around. 
In time. 
I don't think he will, Ethan. 
I really don't. 
I've lost my family. 
I've lost everyone. 
Not everyone. 
Then you'll take back your letter of resignation? 
If you want me to. 
I do. 
I need your help, Ethan. 
And I need it now. 
The F.B.I. Has taken a man into custody. 
His name is Alan Wilson. 
Woods is on his way to pick up Wilson. 
You need to sign the transfer documents. 
What's wrong? 
 What's going on? 
   Get out of here, Janis. 
 Excuse me? 
 I said get out of here. 
 What are you doing? 
Get out! 
No. Absolutely not. I'm staying right here 
until Wilson is transferred. 
 Fine. 
 What are you Renee, what are you doing? 
 Put your hands over your head. 
  I said do it now, Janis! 
Secure your hands to that pole. 
 Now! 
 Okay, okay, okay. JustJust 
calm down, all right? Just 
Renee, please don't do this. 
Please don't do this. 
You've done yourjob. You arrested him. 
Let the courts take it from here. 
Stop this now, before it's too late. 
Don't throw away your career. 
This is absolutely insane. 
Larry would not have wanted this. 
Don't dishonor his death like this. 
Daddy. 
I'm too late. 
No, he's still alive, Kim. 
We induced a coma to help ease him through the harsher symptoms. 
My name is Gohar. 
I'm a friend. 
A friend? 
We spent the last few minutes talking and I can tell you he's accepted what is happening. 
Maybe he has. 
But I haven't. 
The stem cell treatment that you told me about. 
Can we still do it? 
As I told you, it's experimental and the odds of success are very low. 
Just tell me if it's too late to try. 
No. 
Then I want to do it. 
 The risks  I understand the risks. 
and I know my father didn't want me to take that chance, but it's my choice now and I made up my mind. 
This is Sunny Macer. 
I need immediate access to a surgical suite. 
Have Dr. Rosen 
call me right away. 
I'm sorry, Daddy. 
But I'm not ready to let you go. 
(gasping) Madam President, we have your husband, but he sustained a gunshot wound to the chest. 
TAYLOR: Is my husband going to be okay? 
We're not going to know anything until the doctors see him. 
Since your husband was the only leverage that Dubaku had left, it's safe to say that he's trying to leave the country now. 
Whatever we're going to do to find him, we're going to have to do it fast. 
Whatever it takes, I want that son of a bitch found! 
Have someone find my daughter, Olivia, and bring her to me. 
What is it that's so important for my mother to steal me away while I'm trying to do business? 
It's your father. 
He's been shot. 
My, God, I... 
Do you think I'm a fool, Mr. Burnett? 
If anything should happen to me on my way out of the country, a data file with all the names and bank transactions of all those involved will be sent to the Justice Department. 
You told me that once Dubaku served his purpose, you'd take him out. 
Why are we still helping him? 
He's threatening to expose us using a database he's kept with names and accounts of everyone involved. 
Including mine? 
We don't know where the file is, so you just better pray that he gets away. 
I'm begging you, Marika... 
FBI! Don't move! 
Get on your knees! 
Now! 
Where is Dubaku? 
Who? 
RENEE: Don't play games with me! 
Ike Dubaku! 
JACK: You know this man? 
She was going to meet him. 
When the car arrives, we would like you to go with the driver, so that we could follow you back to Dubaku. 
You want her to go to him and face him? 
It's the   only chance we have of finding him before he disappears forever. 
I'll do it. 
You keep her safe, you hear me? 
We will. 
You're less than a mile behind the target car. 
I got Metro PDs trying to build a roadblock around us. 
(siren wailing, tires screech) RENEE: We can't afford to lose them, Jack! 
I gave this woman my word we'd protect her. 
(tires screeching) Get out of the car, right now! 
(cops clamoring) Federal agent! 
On the ground! 
She's a federal agent! 
On the ground! 
(panting) BURNETT: Your girlfriend's been turned by the FBI. 
If you let her come to you, you're risking your chances of escape. 
I'll call my driver, have him take care of her. 
No. I'll take care of her. 
Sean, I need to talk to you. 
Is it important? 
You tell me. 
Did you issue a federal warrant on this vehicle? 
What? 
I found a digital footprint on server four's backup partition. 
It originated from your station. 
I'd like to know what the hell is going on! 
Keep your voice down. 
You want to get us caught? 
I sent out the warrant, to sideline Bauer and Renee. 
They were closing in on Dubaku. 
I thought you said Dubaku's on his way out of the country? 
He is, but his girlfriend's talking to FBI. 
They used her to track him. 
Oh, my God. 
Don't worry, I took care of it. 
Bauer and Renee are in police custody. 
By the time they're released, Dubaku will be long gone. 
Are you sure? 
I'm positive. 
Why didn't you just tell me what was happening? 
'Cause I knew you'd react like this. 
The last thing I need right now is one of your meltdowns. 
Now, listen, I got you into this, and I'm going to get you out of it, but not if you start panicking. 
You've got to keep it together. 
I'm just really scared, you know? 
I know. I am, too. 
I'm just a little better at hiding it than you are. 
I've got everything covered. 
I ran a bounce-tap into the conference room speakerphone that they'll never find, and I can hear everything they're saying. 
Now, sit at your station. 
Try and act normal. 
Let me worry about Bauer and Renee. 
Okay? 
The man that we were tracking is responsible for today's terrorist attack. 
If you don't let us go, he's going to get away. 
Look, my Captain's on the phone with your superior. 
You're making a mistake! 
You've got to let us go! 
That warrant had to be sent out by one of Dubaku's operatives. 
I know. 
Then Dubaku knows that Marika is working with us. 
He will kill her, Jack. 
We should not have used her like this. 
We didn't have a choice. 
She was our best asset. 
She's not an asset, Jack. 
She's a human being. 
Colonel. 
The FBI is still looking for us, sir. 
I'll do this quickly. 
Wait there for me. 
Samuel. 
What? What is it? 
Sweetheart, what's wrong? 
Give me your cell phone. 
My cell phone? 
I know you've been talking to the FBI. 
You've been working for them, Marika. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
What are you doing? 
What? What are 
you doing? 
(cell phone smashes) No! 
(grunts) I trusted you! 
How could you do this to me?! 
The FBI told me who you really are. 
About the terrible things you've done. 
And you believed them? 
They showed me proof! 
They showed you lies created by my enemies! 
You don't know me. 
And you don't know my country. 
I brought peace to Sangala. 
(crying softly) No. Shh, shh! 
Don't be afraid, huh? 
It's just... 
when I heard what you had done, it was like you had driven a dagger through my heart. 
I'm a forgiving man, Marika. 
I still want you to come with me. 
I want to give you the life that I promised. 
I can't go with you. 
I don't know who you are. 
You do. 
You do. If you look 
past your fear, you'll see that I am still the man that you fell in love with. 
I won't leave without you, Marika. 
All right. 
You won't be disappointed. 
Come. 
The FBI may be close. 
Your story was verified by FBI. 
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding. 
Did FBI find Marika Donoso? 
I don't know. 
You can ask them yourself. 
Agent Moss wants to talk to you. 
Larry, where are they? 
Where's Marika? 
We lost her cell phone signal. 
What do you mean? 
What happened? 
Don't know. 
Just went dead about three minutes ago. 
Where? 
CHLOE: In an alley on the Northeast corner of N and 10th Street. 
I'm looking through traffic cams now. 
All right, we're going to comm. Standby. 
They lost Marika's signal. 
That's it. 
There. Jack? 
We got a make on the car. 
It's a dark gray Jeep Grand Cherokee, turned south on 11th Street about two minutes ago. 
Copy that. 
Moving to intercept. 
Did you see Marika? 
Yes. She got in the car 
with Dubaku. 
Chloe, stay on those traffic cams. 
I'm on it. 
We're ten minutes from the airfield. 
Is my plane ready? 
Fueled and waiting. 
Did you take care of the problem? 
She's had a change of heart. 
She's coming with me. 
Colonel, she was working with the FBI. 
You were almost arrested because of her. 
She's not your concern. 
You just worry about getting me out of the country. 
Who was that? 
It was a government official. 
He's been working for me. 
A very corrupt man. 
I look forward to no longer dealing with people like him. 
I want to spend time with people I really care about. 
CHLOE: They're still on 11th. 
They just crossed over to New York Avenue. 
Copy that. 
Come on! 
Jack, they're turning left. 
Hold on. 
(tires screeching) Colonel! 
FBI. Go! Go! 
Hold on! 
Ah! 
Get on top of the car! See if 
you can maintain a visual. 
Ow! 
Marika! 
(grunting) Marika! 
Jack, they crashed! 
Go! 
Get back in your car! 
JACK: Larry, Dubaku's vehicle's been involved in an accident. 
We need an ambulance, now! 
Copy. 
Back away! 
Stay on your knees! 
Get on the ground, now! 
Now! 
(gunshots) I got Dubaku. 
(grunting) Agent Walker, the car is on fire. 
Get out of there! 
Get out of there! 
I gave her my word, so back off or help me. 
RENEE: It's her leg-- it's pinned. 
Hold on. 
(grunting) Pull... pull! 
Jack. 
Go! 
You all right? 
RENEE: Come on. 
Larry, where is my ambulance? 
Dubaku's badly injured. 
He's unconscious. 
I need that ambulance now. 
They're on their way, Jack. 
(breathing heavily) ETHAN: Admiral Smith estimates we'll have the capitol of Sangala secured within the hour. 
He's surprised how little resistance our troops have encountered. 
And you'll be happy to know we have liberated the refugee camp in Kasanga Province. 
2,000 civilians are safe from Juma's forces. 
Madam President? 
I'm sorry, Ethan. 
Oh, my God, Kasanga Province. 
That's... That's very good news. 
Uh, maybe we should finish this another time. 
Can I get you anything, Madam President? 
No, thank you. 
Would you like to talk about it? 
What happened to Henry was my fault, Ethan. 
He never believed our son committed suicide. 
He was right. 
And I didn't listen to him. 
And if I had, we wouldn't be here right now. 
Henry wouldn't be fighting for his life, and we might have exposed this conspiracy. 
Our government wouldn't be paralyzed. 
I didn't believe Henry, either. 
No one did. 
But I'm his wife. 
He deserved my trust. 
BUCHANAN: Madam President? 
I'm sorry to interrupt. 
It's all right, Bill. 
Go ahead. 
I just spoke to Larry Moss at FBI. 
We captured Dubaku. 
He was seriously injured in a car crash during the pursuit. 
How bad? 
Critical, nonresponsive. 
Jack Bauer and Agent Walker are with him. 
They'll be there to question him should he regain consciousness. 
So, you're saying that if Dubaku dies, our chances of uncovering this conspiracy die with him. 
He could be the only one who knows the names of everyone in the government he's corrupted-- yes. 
Madam President, given this latest news, I don't think it's safe for you to remain here. 
I strongly urge you to return to the White House. 
I'd prefer to stay with my husband. 
You're too exposed. 
I can't effectively protect you. 
Am I any safer at the White House? 
My administration has been corrupted, Bill, and now you're telling me we're about to lose our only lead. 
Madam President, I assure you I've taken every precaution to secure the White House. 
It's the safest place for you to be right now. 
Henry will be in surgery for several hours, Madam President. 
There's nothing more we can do here. 
You are needed in the Oval Office. 
All right. 
I'll have the cars brought around. 
I'll also redirect your daughter's escorts to the White House. 
Thank you, Bill. 
What are we going to do, Ethan? 
How can we possibly run this government when we don't know who we can trust? 
We'll just have to pray Jack Bauer can get those names from Dubaku. 
You got him stabilized? 
Yes, sir. 
We're transporting him right now. 
Bring him around. 
I need to talk to him. 
Sir, he's in no condition to speak right now. 
This man has information vital to national security bring him around now. 
Now! 
One milligram epinephrine. 
I know you can hear me. 
You're in federal custody. 
These paramedics are trying to save your life. 
You want them to continue, you're gonna tell me what I want to know. 
I want the names of everyone in the United States government that you've been working with. 
Come on. 
You and I both know the game. 
It's over for you now. 
There's no sense in trying to protect them. 
You and I, we're both soldiers. 
I know you don't care about your own life, but you got a family. 
I know where your son is in Sangala. 
I know where he lives, and I swear to you, I will track him down, and I will make him suffer, and I will make sure that he knows his father was responsible. 
All you got to do to make me stop is give me the names. 
Just give me the names. 
Don't hurt my family. 
I have a list... list. 
Where is the list? 
His BP's spiking. 
Give me the list. 
Where is the list?! 
He's going into cardiac arrest. 
Bring him back! 
Get the paddles. 
Start at 200 joules. 
(machine whirring) Clear. 
No response there's a glitch. 
Once more. 
(whirring) Clear. 
There it is again. 
Electronic interference. 
This could be it feels like a metal plate or something. 
All right. 
Amping up to 300. 
(whirring) Clear. 
Where's the plate? 
All right. 
He's stabilized let's get him boarded. 
Where's the plate? 
It's below his rib cage. 
Open him up. 
Sir, we don't have time. 
I have to ask you to step aside. 
You open him up now. 
Do it. 
Sir, this man will die if we don't get him to the hospital. 
Get him out of here. 
Patch me through to Agent Moss. 
This is Moss. 
Larry, it's Jack. 
Go ahead, Jack. 
I found some kind of digital storage device implanted under Dubaku's skin. 
What is it? 
In an effort to protect his family, he said he would provide me with a list of all of his U.S. government contacts. 
He said it was on him; he meant, in him. 
Larry, this is his insurance policy. 
I'm sure of it. 
Jack, we need that data as soon as possible. 
Can you upload the files to FBI? 
I don't think so. 
I've never seen anything like it. 
Hold on one second. 
Officer. 
Officer. 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
I'm working with the FBI. 
I need you to get this device to regional headquarters. 
I want you to give it to an Agent Larry Moss. 
You put this in his hands, his hands only. 
You understand? 
Yes, sir. 
Do it. 
Larry, you got a chopper coming your way. 
You should have the drive in five minutes. 
We're gonna stay with Dubaku. 
Get back to us as soon as you got anything. 
Copy that. 
Sean. 
What is it? 
What's wrong? 
Just listen to me, and try not to overreact. 
Okay, we have a situation, but I think I have a way to handle it. 
What situation? 
You told me you had everything under control. 
I do... 
but they have Dubaku's database. 
What? 
Sean, our names are on that list. 
You told me that you were taking care of this, and now you're telling me that they have our names? 
No, they don't have our names yet, so here's the plan. 
Sean, we have to get out of here. 
We have to get out of here right now! 
I'm not going to jail, Sean! 
Do you hear me? 
Nobody's going to jail. 
I promise. 
I'm sick of your promises. 
You promised me that this is all taken care of. 
You promised me you're leaving your wife. 
You make all these promises, but you never keep any of them! 
Stop talking, and just listen to me now, I told you I have a way out of this, but I need your help, do you understand that? 
Now, listen... okay? 
As soon as O'Brian downloads those files, we're gonna crash the entire system, every single server on this floor. 
That's crazy. 
No, it's not crazy. 
We're gonna go up to the mainframe room... 
initiate a system-wide reformat. 
We'll wipe everything clean, and they won't be able to stop it. 
We're gonna have to bypass a lot of safety protocols, okay? 
But nobody's better at dealing with those servers than you are. 
Isn't that true? 
I need your help. 
I can't do this without you. 
Hmm? 
Erika? 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
Um... 
we're gonna have to... 
tie the main servers together. 
I need an AVI motherboard, but you're gonna have to reconfigure it for a macro uplink. 
Okay, and we have to hurry. 
The drive is gonna be here any minute. 
Go up to the mainframe room and get started. 
I'm gonna prep the motherboard. 
I'll meet you up there. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Hey. 
We're gonna be fine. 
Huh? 
I love you. 
I love you, too. 
Okay, let's go. 
Okay. 
(indistinct chatter) These are Marika Donoso's personal effects. 
Thank you. 
Copy that. 
Get back to me. 
That was Larry. 
They got the drive. 
Chloe's gonna be working on them. 
They should have something in the next few minutes. 
That's all that matters, right, Jack? 
I don't like what happened to Marika any more than you do. 
We did what was necessary. 
You better figure out a way to live with it. 
How, Jack? Pretend 
that it never happened? 
Is it that easy for you? 
I'll let you know when Chloe's got something. 
Here it is. 
(sighs): This is a PX-1-7 drive. 
It's got an auto-erase function. 
We've only got one download. 
(computer clinks and chirps) Where have you been? 
Just took a little longer than I thought. 
(computer beeps) What are you doing? 
Checking surveillance. 
Got to keep an eye on Larry and O'Brian. 
Once we do this, they're gonna realize someone's up here in a few seconds. 
We'll have to make a clean exit. 
How much longer is this going to take? 
I just have to bypass safety protocols. 
(phone ringing) Once they're down, I'll start the reformat. 
Go ahead. 
Dubaku hasn't arrived at the airfield, and he's not answering his cell phone. 
BURNETT: What's going on? 
FBI got him. 
What?! 
How long have you known about this? 
They're not going to get anything out of him. 
He's unconscious in the hospital. 
There was a crash during a chase. 
Listen, the FBI recovered that database you told me about, the list of names. 
I'm in the process of deleting it. 
I'm going to erase every trace of it. 
I don't have to tell you what will happen if they get that list. 
They won't. I'm gonna 
take care of the database. 
You need to take care of Dubaku. 
Don't worry about him. 
You just make sure... 
ERIKA: Damn it! 
I got to go. 
What's wrong? 
It-It isn't working. 
What do you mean, it isn't working? 
All the inputs are active, the servers are aligned, but the reformat won't start. 
It doesn't make any sense. 
Okay, well, just-just think it through, Erika. 
Right? You 
can do this. 
Would you just shut up? 
Okay? 
Okay. 
Has to be server three. 
(beep) All right, server three was upgraded last week. 
Which means they restored the partitions to the system default settings. 
How could I be so stupid? 
I just have to configure the parameters. 
Okay. 
(trilling) Okay? Is that it? 
I think so. 
Program's running. 
(computer trilling) What? What's happening? 
What's going on? 
The hard drive's reformatting. 
What? 
The files are being erased. 
We're losing everything. 
Well, make it stop. 
I don't have the access. 
Get the PX-1-7 out. 
It's too late. 
It's erased. 
(indistinct, lively chatter) CHLOE: This is deliberate. 
It's not a glitch. 
Someone's trying to crash the system. 
Where's your mainframe room? 
Come on. 
Here they come. 
We got to get out of here. 
Almost there. 
Erika... 
It's done. 
Are you sure? 
Yeah. It'll take a few minutes 
for the reformat to be complete, but there's no stopping it. 
Oh, baby. 
Mm. 
I knew you could do it. 
Yeah. We gonna be okay? 
We're gonna be fine. 
(gunshot) (Erika gasps) (panting) (groaning) (gasping) (sighs) Sorry. 
(gunshot, groaning) (groans) (groaning) (door opening) Get on the floor! 
It wasn't me! 
Get on the floor! 
(groaning) (Sean groaning) Larry, it wasn't me. 
Chloe! 
SEAN: Larry, I followed her up here. 
She was trying to crash the system. 
She shot me! 
I went for the weapon, and it went off. 
Security, this is Agent Moss. 
I need a team to lock down the mainframe room. 
And get a medic up here! Chloe, 
can you recover the files? 
I don't know yet. 
What files?! 
What the hell is happening?! 
You tell me what the hell is happening, Sean! 
You were shutting me out, Larry, so I looked around on my own. 
I found out that Erika was rerouting the sub-cam channel! 
What the hell was she doing? 
She sent out a-a warrant on a vehicle with two suspects. 
I knew something was wrong. 
That's not part of her job. 
I asked her about it, and she tried to deny it. 
She was acting very strangely. 
Why didn't you say anything? 
I don't know what the hell it meant, so I hacked into her hard drive, and I found schematics for the main server. 
Bypass codes for the safety protocols. 
I followed her up here to see what she was up to. 
The second I realized she was trying to crash the system, I-I confronted her. 
She shot me. 
I went for the gun. 
Larry, I didn't mean to kill her. 
Halt! Halt! 
Larry, it's too late. 
The system's fried. 
Dubaku's files are gone. 
Are you sure? 
Can you recover anything? 
The server's wiped clean. 
She got everything. 
Is this everything you got? 
No, it's not. 
I didn't have time to print out every single message that came through Erika's workstation. 
That's everything she was doing for the past three days. 
Look, Larry, I told you what happened. 
I feel like you owe me an explanation. 
What the hell is going on here? 
(sighs) The government's been compromised by Dubaku. 
FBI, Secret Service. 
God knows who else. 
That's why I shut you out, brought in Chloe O'Brian. 
We were in the middle of decrypting a file that had the names of everyone on Dubaku's payroll. 
Erika erased it when she wiped the server. 
That was our only lead. 
You should have told me about this. 
You should have trusted me. 
Sean, I didn't know who to trust. 
You all right? 
How's your arm? 
It hurts like hell. It's fine. 
Oh. When you're up for 
it, I'm gonna need you to write a statement. 
Okay. 
And keep your mouth shut. 
(phone ringing) We don't know who else in this building might be working for Dubaku. Yeah. 
Larry, don't ask me how, but I did it. 
You did what? 
I recovered Dubaku's files. 
What? 
I was running a mirror file on an outside server. 
I always do that when I'm dealing with sensitive materials. 
Erika's parameters were too narrow to catch it. 
How soon can you have it decrypted? 
It's decrypted. It's been 
decrypting this entire time. 
Dubaku kept detailed evidence on everyone. 
Phone logs, financial records it's all here. 
Listen, I'm gonna need you to cross-check with FBI personnel. 
Sean said Erika was working by herself, but I got to be 100% sure. 
Okay. Hold on. 
Yeah. 
Chloe recovered the files. 
That's great. 
I should get to that statement. 
Yeah. 
Sean? 
When you're done there, I want you to go downstairs and see Dr. Weber. 
You shot a fellow agent. 
You're gonna want to talk to somebody. 
Yes, sir. 
JANIS: Hey, do you have any idea what's going on with the servers? 
Not a clue. 
The whole system's down. 
I tried to get into the mainframe room, and security has got it locked off. 
Ask Larry about it, Janis. 
Where are you going? 
I got to run an errand. 
Now? 
All right, all right. 
Hold off. 
(grunts) You better start talking to me right now! 
I'd like to speak with my attorney. 
Put him in holding. 
(breathing heavily) Get me Bill Buchanan at the White House. 
(indistinct chatter) Where is my sister? 
Where's Marika? 
There was an accident. 
What happened? 
Marika didn't make it. 
What-What do you mean? 
There was a crash. 
Uh, it happened during the pursuit. 
Marika was killed. 
I don't understand. 
You said that you'd protect her. 
You said she'd be okay. 
We wouldn't have caught Dubaku without Marika's help. 
She was very, very brave, Rosa. 
What is this? 
This is supposed to make everything okay? 
Marika was all I had! 
I trusted you with her life, and you let her die?! 
I'm so sorry. 
(gasps) (crying): Don't touch me! 
(crying) You killed my sister! 
You didn't care how you did it or who got hurt! 
JACK: Agent Walker? 
Excuse me. 
I just got off the phone with Larry. 
Dubaku wasn't lying. 
On the drive was a list of everyone he was working with in the government. 
They're getting ready to make arrests. 
It's over. 
It's not over for Rosa. 
What happened to Marika was a tragedy. 
But I'm not going to stand here and tell you what we did was wrong, because we weren't. 
She made a choice, a brave one, to get involved, but she made it. 
God, listen to yourself, Jack. 
You don't even sound human. 
Don't you feel anything? 
We had a job to do! 
To protect the hundreds if not thousands of innocent lives that would not have had a choice if we let a terrorist attack take place. 
What we did wasn't wrong. 
It was necessary. 
I read your file. 
When your wife was killed, did you feel that or did you just tell yourself that that was necessary? 
What do you want from me? 
What do you want from me?! 
I just want to know that you feel something! 
I want to know that you feel the same kind of pain that I do! 
Do you feel that?! 
Do you feel that?! 
(crying) It's all right. 
You're going to be all right. 
It's going to take a while. 
But you will learn to live with it. 
What if I don't want to learn to live with it? 
Then quit. 
And by the way, that stunt you pulled by the car... 
...you ever pull your weapon 
on my again, you better intend to use it. 
I did. 
(door opens) Olivia. 
What's going on? 
How's Dad? 
He's still in surgery. 
We're waiting for word. 
Is he going to be all right? 
He was seriously injured. 
The bullet went through his lung. 
Livy. 
The doctors are doing everything they can. 
Who did this? 
It's complicated. 
I want to know who shot my father! 
Your father found out about a conspiracy inside the government. 
The people behind it tried to kill him. 
Who are these people? 
We're trying to find out right now. 
That's all I can tell you. 
Okay, I want to go to the hospital. 
I want to be there when he wakes up. 
I can't let you do that. 
The people who shot your father are still out there. 
It's not safe. 
I don't care, I want to see Dad! 
This is not a debate. 
I'm not going to risk anything happening to you. 
You're staying in the White House, and that's the end of it. 
AIDE (intercom beeps): Madam President, Bill Buchanan is here to see you. 
I'll be right out. 
There's a lot we need to talk about, Olivia. 
We've been ignoring things for far too long. 
It took Dad getting shot for you to finally want to talk? 
Let's not go down this path. 
Not again. 
Not today. 
We'll talk later. 
One of the guards will take you up to the residence. 
All right, Bill. 
What is it? 
I have very good news. 
Jack Bauer just recovered a database hidden on Dubaku. 
It contains the names of everyone in the government who was working with him. 
How many? 
Close to a hundred people, across all agencies. 
Some at very high levels. 
My God. 
Dubaku kept detailed files on every person. 
This is exactly what we've been working toward, Madam President. 
We can finally put an end to this conspiracy. 
I assume you've already begun acting on this information. 
Yes. 
As a matter of fact, Larry Moss just identified two more individuals working within FBI who were on the list. 
He's confident the Bureau is secure. 
What's the next step? 
I'm working with FBI to coordinate an interagency sweep. 
We should start making arrests within the hour. 
Bill, I don't know what to say to thank you. 
What you have done here today puts all of us in your debt. 
I appreciate that, Madam President, but there are a lot of people to thank, including Jack Bauer. 
He's scheduled to resume his testimony before the Senate Committee tomorrow morning. 
I'm aware of that. 
Madam President, forgive me if I'm out of line, but I feel Senator Mayer is on a personal crusade against Jack. 
He's already taken his pound of flesh. 
He dismantled CTU, attacked the reputations of people who've served this country with honor. 
Now he wants to make an example of Jack. 
It isn't right, Madam President, especially after today. 
What are you asking me to do, Bill? 
I'm asking you to speak to Senator Mayer. 
Jack Bauer helped save this country. 
He doesn't deserve to spend the rest of his life in prison. 
I appreciate your sentiments, Bill, but I'm going to have to think about this. 
That's all I'm  asking, Madam President. 
Thank you. 
What the hell are you doing here? 
I need to talk with you. 
About what? 
I told you I was going to follow up on a lead. 
No, you said you were going to turn yourself in as soon as this was over. 
And I will. 
But this ain't over yet. 
There's going to be another attack. 
Here in D.C. 
Dubaku is in custody. 
He's already provided us with a list of everyone in the government that was working with him. 
It's not Dubaku. 
It's his boss, Juma. 
He knows he's about to lose control of his country. 
So he's going to try and rally his people behind him by striking back at the U.S. 
How do you know this? 
I tracked down a source. 
What source? 
He was one of the men I worked with on Emerson's crew. 
He had a direct line of communication with the Juma regime in Sangala. 
It wasn't easy getting the information out of him, but I'm convinced it's accurate. 
Then you should hand it over to FBI. 
No. 
My source tells me that the window opens at 1900 hours. 
By the time the FBI wades through their procedures and red tape, it's going to be too late. 
What's the target? 
He doesn't know the exact target, but it's definitely going to be of high value and high impact. 
He gave me the name of somebody who's been involved in the planning. 
Who? 
Ryan Burnett. 
Senator Mayer's Chief of Staff. 
That's right. 
He's been involved from the very beginning. 
What about Mayer? 
No. 
He's not involved. 
You're sure about that? 
Yeah. 
You better not be lying to me, Tony. 
This is real, Jack. 
Burnett will be on Dubaku's list. 
As soon as he finds out that Dubaku's in custody, he'll start running. 
You don't have a lot of time. 
I've already got a tail on him. 
(sighs) Listen, Jack, if you're with me, meet me at the corner of First and Constitution. 
I need your help. 
MOSS: Thank you for your patience. 
As I'm sure some of you already know, our government and its ancillary agencies, including this office, have been infiltrated by operatives in league with Ike Dubaku. 
(phone rings) Yes, Senator? 
MAYER: Ryan, can you step in here? 
Yes, sir. 
(knocks on door) I'm going to the White House. 
Sir? 
President Taylor wants to speak to me regarding Jack Bauer. 
Bauer? 
What about him? 
I don't know, but we'll find out soon enough. 
It's odd, though. 
What is, sir? 
Bauer was pulled away from the Senate hearings this morning to help the FBI with an investigation. 
And now the president wants to talk to me about him. 
I don't like the timing of this. 
Grab your laptop, Ryan. 
I want you there with me. 
Yes, sir. 
Season07 Episode18 ******** Mr. Knowles,my name is jack bauer. 
Jonas hodges is in possession of a military-grade bioweapon. 
I was contaminated when trying to intercept the canisters. 
I promise you,sir,the weapon is on your base. 
Do you have any idea where they might be? 
Think I might. 
I have an order from the president of the united states. 
To search this building. 
Are there weapons of mass destruction? 
Are there weapons of any kind? 
You've got five minutes to get these helicopters flying out of here with all of you on board. 
Larry,I want you and your men to pull out on hodges' timetable. 
Tony,you're gonna need  to find a way to stay behind. 
We're gonna get your vectors  over to a man  that we contacted  inside starkwood. 
His name is douglas knowles. He 
believes he knows where the weapons are. 
Stay here. I'll be right back. 
Jack! We need a medic! 
The bioagent is more virulent than we thought. 
All we're doing here is just masking the symptoms. 
I understand. 
 There's something you may want to consider. 
 What's that? 
A possible treatment using stem cells from a genetically compatible donor. 
I saw your file,and it says you have a daughter. 
I don't want my daughter involved in this. 
Jack.It should be her choice. 
Well,it's not. I'm the one who's dying. 
I'm in. But they got knowles. 
A little loyalty. 
Wasn't that the least I deserved? 
You can't take on the federal government. 
I have a visual on the weapon. 
Okay,those are the canisters. 
I'll notify admiral smith the target is located and confirmed. 
You remember starkwood was deployed to pakistan, that we requisitioned a missile system at that time. 
Well,three of those missiles are now loaded with a pathogen and aimed at cities on our eastern seaboard. 
You will keep this conversation to yourself and turn the planes around. 
And if you do not comply,madam president, I will have no choice but to launch those missiles. 
Abort the air strike,admiral smith. 
 Ma'am,with all respect... 
 damn it,admiral. 
Abort the air strike immediately! 
********** Tony,it's jack. Do you copy? 
Jack,what the hell is going on? 
Where are those f-18s? 
Tim woods just called from the white house. 
The president canceled the air strike. 
What? Why? 
She doesn't believe our intel is strong enough to justify military action. 
Is she out of her mind? 
Jack,I saw those canisters with my own eyes. 
So did you. They're in that bunker. 
She's not gonna get any better intel than that. 
I know. It doesn't make 
any sense,but right now, we've got a presidential order to pull you out of the starkwood compound, along with the perimeter teams. 
Tony,larry's been told the president's decision. 
He's preparing to move his teams out,but he's got to get you out of there first. 
He'll be sending you coordinates for an exfiltration point along the southwest perimeter. 
 Tony? 
 Hold on a second. 
Tony,what's going on? 
Jack,I might know why the president called off that air strike. 
What do you mean? 
I think starkwood's got surface-to-surface missiles. 
That's how they're gonna deploy the bioweapon. 
How do you know this? 
A fuel truck just pulled up next to the bunker where they're storing the weapons. 
They're pumping rp-7 into an underground depot. 
What's rp-7? 
It's a propellant only used in surface-to-surface missiles. Tony,are you sure? 
I'm looking right at it,jack. 
Do you have any c-4 on you? 
Yeah,I've got three charges and a remote detonator. 
Do you think you can gain access to the underground fuel depot? 
Yeah,I think we've got a play,but I've got to move soon... 
before that fuel truck pulls away. 
Okay,I want you to maintain your position. I'm gonna call the president. 
Come with me. 
What is it,tim? 
Madam president,the joint chiefs are beginning to question your decision to call off the air strike against starkwood. 
They think the intelligence we received from tony almeida was sufficient and that we may be missing an opportunity to destroy the bioweapons. 
I gave my orders,tim. No air strike. 
No military action of any kind against starkwood. 
Now,I asked you to handle the joint chiefs; handle them. 
I'll do my best,ma'am,but if I may... 
what is our next move? 
Jonas hodges is coming to the white house. 
He wants to speak with me alone. 
 For what possible reason? 
 I don't know. 
Madam president,shouldn't your advisors be at that meeting? 
Tim,stop asking me questions. 
If you want to help,make sure as few people as possible know that jonas hodges is coming here. 
and bring him in through the southeast service entrance. 
Yes? 
Madam president,jack bauer and renee walker are calling from fbi. 
You did speak to fbi? 
Yes,ma'am,five minutes ago. I gave them 
your reason for calling off the air strike, but I must warn you,they were skeptical as well. 
Be ready for hodges. 
Mr. Bauer,agent walker,this 
is the president. 
Madam president,we need to talk. 
No,mr. Bauer,we don'T. 
You need to listen. 
I appreciate everything that you have done in gathering this intel, but I still need more before I can authorize an air strike. I'm sorry. 
Madam president,with all due respect,I don't believe you're being truthful with us. 
Excuse me? 
I think you called off the air strike because jonas hodges is in possession of surface-to-surface missiles armed with the bioweapon, and he's threatening to use them in case you try to take action against him. 
Madam president,tony almeida witnessed a truck pumping rp-7 rocket fuel into an underground depot situated right next to the bunker where the bioweapons are being stored. 
The only purpose for rp-7 rocket fuel is to launch missiles. 
Madam president,please just tell us the truth. 
Jack,hodges has 13 python missiles armed with the bioweapons. 
Three are currently aimed at american cities. 
He demanded that i recall the planes,or he would launch. 
 What does hodges want? 
 I don't know... 
but he's requested a face-to-face meeting. 
He'll be at the white house in a few minutes. 
Madam president,the only reason he wants a face-to-face meeting is to lay out his demands, and whatever they are,you cannot negotiate with him. 
I'm not planning on negotiating with him,jack. 
Once he places his cards on the table,I am sure that I can... 
I can make him realize the futility of what he is trying to do. 
Jonas hodges is a traitor and a terrorist,and after everything that's happened today, are you really naive enough to believe that you can simply talk to him and change his mind? 
I'm not new at this,jack,and right now,I don't have another option. 
Madam president,you do. Tony 
almeida is still inside starkwood. 
I ordered him exfiltrated immediately. 
What's he still doing there? 
I asked him to stand by until I could talk to you. 
He believes he can gain access to the fuel depot and lay a series of explosive charges and take the missiles out. 
Now,I believe this can work,but we need to act quickly. 
What about the bioweapons? 
Rp-7 rocket fuel burns at 5,000 degrees. 
There will be nothing left. 
Once the weapons are destroyed,larry moss and his teams can move in on starkwood and lock it down. 
Hodges gave standing orders to his men to launch the missiles at the first detection of government inrference. 
If almeida is detected,thousands of americans will die,jack. 
Madam president,I know that there's a risk, but I would not be asking you to do this if I didn't think it would work. 
Please,I am begging you. Trust me. 
How long did the doctors give you to live? 
Uh,they're not sure,but the pathogen has started to take effect. 
Then there's not much i can threaten you with,is there? 
I expect you'll do what you think is right. 
what the hell does that mean? 
She wants us to go in. 
But she didn't authorize it. 
She can'T. She needs this 
to be a covert operation. 
If something were to go wrong and those missiles were to be launched, the president needs to be able to swear under oath that we were working on our own. 
She wants us to go in. Notify 
larry. We need to move fast. 
I told you I'd get you to the white house. 
I just didn't think it would be under these conditions. 
It was brilliant,you know. 
What was that,sir? 
What you did to make almeida think that you were betraying me. 
 Quite brilliant. 
 Thank you,sir. 
You put yourself in harm's way,greg,and I'll never forget that. 
I can't believe... I'm feeling nervous. 
You're gonna do fine,sir. 
 Thank you,tim. 
 You're welcome. 
So,it sounds to me like the president didn't actually authorize this. 
Technically,no. It was more of an... 
an indirect order,but believe me,larry,she wants this to happen. 
She's gonna meet with hodges,and we're gonna blow those fuel tanks. 
Larry,do you have a problem with this? 
As a matter of fact,no. None whatsoever. 
These starkwood bastards drew on my men. 
I'm looking forward to getting back in there. 
All right,have your teams hold their position and be ready to move. 
 Believe me,you'll know when it happens. 
 All right. 
 Tony,it's jack. Do you copy? 
 Yeah,I'm here. 
You were right about the missiles. 
The president confirmed it. 
We're gonna have to carry this out as a covert operation. 
Larry and his men are standing by to lock down starkwood as soon as the missiles have been destroyed. 
 Good. 
 Tony... 
I need to know that you can do this without being detected. 
Hodges's given his men standing orders to launch those missiles if there's a breach of any kind. 
Yeah. I can do it. 
 Okay. Good luck. 
 Yeah. 
We're done here. 
I'm going to go run a perimeter check. 
You said you just finished one. 
I know. 
But I don't think we can be too careful right now. 
 Yeah. 
 it's me. 
Auxiliary tanks are fueled and ready. 
Confirmed. I'll be 
down in a few minutes. 
Copy that. 
Freeze! Let me see your hands. 
Almeida. 
Put your gun on the ground. Slowly. 
Kick it. 
drag him under the truck. Now! Let's go! 
Hands up. 
What do you think you're doing? 
You're going to take me down to the fuel tanks. 
Let's go. 
Open it up. 
Go ahead. 
President will see you now. 
Very good. Thank you. 
Mr. Hodges. 
Madam president. 
This is greg seaton,my associate. 
He's a remarkable man. Doesn't look 
remarkle,but believe me,he's a genius. 
Yes,I know mr. Seaton. 
Thank you,gentlemen. 
It never gets old,does it? 
Stepping into the... the oval office. 
Almost smells of history. 
 Can we sit? 
 Please. 
You know,this is the first time I've been in this room since you were elected? 
I'm aware of that,yes. 
Under your predecessor,I used to drop by every couple of months. 
I'd brief president daniels on what was really going on in the world. 
And you've been excluded now. 
 Is that what this is about? 
 No,ma'am. 
It's about allowing starkwood to fulfill the purpose for which it was founded: Protecting this country. 
You have been attacking this country. 
You and general juma have killed hundreds of innocent people, including my son. 
Madam president,I'm deeply sorry for your loss, and my heart breaks for all the lives that were taken today, but I'm shocked that you would think that I had anything to do with it. 
We have evidence that you've been working with juma. 
Your intelligence agencies have failed you. 
If I had kno what juma was up to,I would have done everything in my power to stop him. 
So let's push aside all these baseless accusations and maybe we can do some business here. 
I'm listening. 
Madam president,I know you're a student of history, and so you're well aware that our nation's independence was won with the aid of private armies, and we can't survive without them. 
Look how easy it was to get bioweapons into this country. 
Our defenses are fragile. 
They're on the verge of collapse. 
But it's not too late to do something about it. 
So what are you suggesting? 
In short,I want a seat at the table. 
Starkwood needs to be involved in the shaping of military policy,domestic and global. 
It sounds more like you want a seat at the head of the table. 
Madam president,I'm notere to supplant your authority. 
What I'm proposing is a partnership. 
Think of starkwood as the fifth branch of the military. Greg? 
This contains the protocols that will serve as the basis of our agreement. 
I suggest that we review them together. 
Jonas,I agreed to this meeting because I wanted to hear what you had to say. 
But what you're proposing is blackmail. 
Well,that's putting it in the worst possible light. 
You are threatening to kill thousands of people. 
I'm not proud of this chapter. 
I'm the first to admit it. 
And it's time to turn the page. This 
country has seen enough bloodshed today. 
For the sake of the american people,madam president, I implore you to work with me,and let's move past this. 
Pick up the document,madam president. 
Let's go. Come on. Get up 
now,or I'll leave you down here. 
And you don't want that believe me. Get up! Let's go! 
what is it? 
Code 363. That's a government breach. 
 We're supposed to launch. 
 Are you sure it's not a false alarm? 
No way to tell. 
We've got standing orders,though. 
Let's start the launch sequence. 
too late. 
Launch sequence complete. 
Target is locked. 
Enter the firing codes. 
Sir,we need to confirm this. 
That's not the correct protocol. 
We're about to kill 10,000 people. 
We should get someone on the phone. 
Enter the codes. Now! 
No,sir. 
that's it. That's us. Let's 
go. We're a go! We're a go! 
 it's done. 
 Tony? 
Tony,do you copy? 
An explosion of that magnitude would have shorted out his com. 
We're gonna have to wait for larry and his men to move in. 
It says here that you want active status in the pentagon's strategic planning group. 
That's correct. 
That would give you access to level 6 classified material. 
Not even the vice president has that clearance. 
These points are nonnegotiable. 
I'm not here to debate them. 
Let's review the next section,which concerns senate oversight of starkwood field operations. 
I'm sorry to interrupt,madam president,but I need to speak with you. 
Can it wait? 
No,ma'am,it can'T. 
 Will you excuse me for a moment? 
 Of course. 
satcom has just detected a massive explosion on the starkwood compound. 
The bioweapons facility has been destroyed. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes,ma'am. 
Judging by the size of the explosion,nothing could have survived. 
But I don't know how this happened. This wasn't us. 
 Call fbi and have them lock down starood. 
 They're already moving in. 
Good. And when this is over,I 
want to speak to jack bauer. 
 Yes,ma'am. 
 You know... 
I'm not sure I'm reaching her. 
I think you handled it perfectly,sir. 
We'll see. 
What the hell is this? 
Put this document into evidence,and take these men into custody. 
What are you thinking? 
Have you lost your mind? 
Jonas,we've taken out your missiles. It's over. 
That's impossible. 
It's the truth. 
And you're under arrest. 
You are a terrorist and a murderer, and I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure that you pay dearly for your crimes. 
My only crime is that I'm trying to protect my country! 
You think this ends with me? 
I'm just a small cog in a very big machine. 
Hold on. 
You can't even begin to imagine what you're up against. 
What are you talking about? 
You'll find out. 
Get him out of here. 
the advanced biohazard team is reporting no trace of the bioweapon anywhere near the blast sight. 
 It was incinerated in the explosion. 
 Good. 
 Any word on tony? 
 Not yet. Larry's searching the compound now. 
We should hear something soon. 
Mr. Bauer,you have a phone 
call; it's the president. 
I'll take it in the conference room. Thank you. I'll be right back. 
Madam president. 
Mr. Bauer,jonas hodges is under arrest. 
That's good news. That's very good. 
Jack,you and your team provided me with an option. 
And for that,I am deeply grateful. 
And so are the american people. 
Madam president,it was tony almeida who risked his life to destroy those missiles. 
And as you know,he's facing arrest for things he did leading up to today, and I was hoping that maybe you could... 
yes,mr. Bauer? 
Jack? 
Um,I'm sorry,I... 
completely forgot what I was saying. 
You were talking about mr. Almeida. 
And my answer is yes,I-I will take his actions into account. 
Thank you. 
What's happening? 
I-I-I'm not exactly sure. 
Jack,I am so sorry you're going through this. 
I wish that there were something I could do. 
M-madam president,I appreciate this phone call. 
But I'm sorry. I-I have to go. 
 Of course. 
 Thank you. 
jonas hodges has been arrested. 
Let me know as soon as you got tony. 
I need to go see dr. Mace 
Yes,madam president? 
Call ben landry at cdc. 
Tell him that I want real-time updates on jack bauer's condition. 
Yes,ma'am. 
we've secured all entry points and command posts and are sweeping the compound on a grid-by-grid basis. 
 Are you meeting any resistance? 
 No. 
They're surrendering peacefully and cooperating. 
St of the men on this base,I don't think they had any idea what was going on. 
What about almeida? 
 Uh,he's here. We found him. 
 Is he okay? 
Some cuts and bruises,but otherwise,he's in pretty good shape. 
Good. Good. Jack will 
be glad to hear that. 
Listen,renee... 
we've known each other a long time,you know. 
Um,so much stuff has happened today. 
Yeah. We have a lot 
to talk about. I know. 
Excuse me,agent walker. 
 Your visitshe's in the waiting area. 
 Okay,thank you. 
Larry,I've got to go. Kim bauer's here. 
 Jack's daughter?  Yes. 
I-I asked her to come. 
There's this experimental treatment for jack's disease,but he needs compatible stem cells. 
It's a long shot,but it's the only hope he's got. 
Okay. Let me know how it goes,all right? 
 I will. I'm going off com. 
 All right. 
did they say something about kim bauer? 
Yeah,she's at fbi helping with a treatment for jack,some,uh,some kind of stem cell therapy. 
So they think he's gonna be all right? 
Didn't sound promising. 
Listen,tony,this isn't easy for me,but,uh... 
I'm under orders to take you into federal custody. 
 Yeah,I know. 
 You did a brave thing here. 
Probably saved thousands of lives. 
For the record,I don't think this is how you should be repaid. 
I appreciate that,but,uh... 
I'm ready to pay for what I've done. 
Get the cuffs off him,will you? 
Chopper's on the way. I'll be 
taking you back to fbi,all right? 
Memory loss is consistent with the disease,mr. Bauer. 
I just wouldn't have expected it to manifest this quickly. 
It's not just memory loss. 
It feels like... 
I don't know exactly how to explain it. 
I feel like,uh,like I'm losing some part of myself. 
The disease profile includes personality changes,sometimes even hallucinations. 
But this is a weaponized pathogen we don't know much about. 
Military's still combing through the remains of the bioweapons lab in sangala, so we expect to learn something very soon. 
You were able to give me something that controlled the shaking. 
Is there anything that you can give me that would help me with this? 
No. I'm sorry. 
Okay. Thank you. Excuse me. 
jack,is it all right? 
Yeah,um,I'm gonna need to go on record about everything that happened today. 
And we need to do it soon. 
I'm not sure how much longer I'm gonna be le to provide you with the details. 
Okay. First,there's something 
that you need to know. 
What? 
It's about kim. She's here,jack. 
I told her that you were sick and that she might be able to help with the treatment. 
You did... 
you did what? Come here. Come here. 
Who the hell do you think you are? 
Who the hell do you think you are? 
You think this is easy? 
You think you understand what I'm going through? Because you don'T. 
I am dying. 
And I was okay with it. I could handle it. 
And now you've put in front of me the one thing, the one thing that is gonna make this unbearable. 
 Jack,listen... 
 no,you listen to me. 
I specifically told you do not drag my daughter into this. 
No one dragged her into anything. 
She's been trying to see you all day. 
What? 
She was at the senate hearing this morning. 
She flew out from L.A.To be there,but we 
pulled you out before she could see you. 
She's been leaving messages at our office all day. 
They just didn't get to me till now. 
If you want,I can tell her that you're not here. 
I can tell her that you can't see her. 
Can't do that. 
 Where is she? 
 Down the hall. 
Show me. 
daddy. 
How are you feeling? 
I'm-I'm okay. 
You're not in any pain? 
No. 
Come sit down. 
Did agent walker tell you that I was trying to find you? 
Yeah. 
I've tried everything to track you down: State department,private investigators. 
Every time I got a phone number or an address,you were already gone. 
I'm sorry. 
I thought I was doing the best thing for you by staying away. 
Daddy,I've missed you so much. 
I've missed you,too. 
You need to know how sorry I am for everything that you've had to live through because of me. 
No,don't do that. 
Don't put that on yourself. I'm 
the one that should apologize. 
I pushed you away. 
And instead of taking responsibility for all the mistakes I've made in my life,I blamed you. 
And it was stupid and immature. 
And now,all the time that we've lost... 
agent walker told me that there's a chance a small chance that I could help you,and you don't want me to. 
The treatment is experimental. 
and I don't think it's going to work. 
And you don't want to because you're afraid to ask me. 
No. 
There's a risk to you. 
A small risk... worth taking. 
Not to me. 
Kim... I'm dying. 
And whatever small chance there is to stop that from happening it is not worth the pain for me to let you sit there and watch me die. 
Daddy,I don't want to lose you. 
 Come here. 
 I don'T. 
sweetheart,it's going to be all right. 
It's gonna be all right. I promise you. 
what is it? what? 
sweetheart,I'm sorry... 
but you need to go. 
Please,baby,please,I'm begging you. 
 I love you so much. 
 Honey,I love you,too. 
Please,baby. thank you. Go. 
perimeter 2 to dispatch: Auxiliary gate 6 is clear. 
Copy that,p-2. Hold your position. 
Freeze! Show me your hands. Get 'em up! 
P-2 to dispatch. 
I have an agent down and a suspect in custody. Code red. 
Copy that,p-2. 
All available agents respond to auxiliary gate 6. 
Drop the bag. 
Hands on the hood. 
P-2 to dispatch. Put me through 
to agent moss. It's urgent. 
agent moss. 
Agent moss,this is davis at auxiliary gate 6. 
I have a starkwood op in custody. 
He killed one of our agents. 
He was carrying a canister of the bioweapon,trying to smuggle it out using one of our vehicles. 
What? Are you sure? 
I'm looking at it right now. 
Agent davis? Davis? 
 walker. 
 Renee,we got a breach in the cordon at gate 6. 
One of the starkwood ops-- he's got a canister of the bioweapon. 
What? 
It was id'd by agent davis,who I believe has just been shot. 
The suspect may be fleeing in an fbi vehicle, so I need you to close down all access roads,and alert perimeter units  and metro police. 
 Janis,get me dc metro. 
 I'm gonna pursue it from the air. 
Let's go! Let us up! 
renee,alert homeland,let them know what's going on. 
Are we thinking this is another attack,larry? 
I don't know,but there's enough prion variant in one of those canisters to take out a small city. 
Agent miller,are there any major roadways in our perimeter that starkwood eratives could have used? 
Yes,sir. We're coming up on highway 42. 
Should I turn us that way? 
Yes,until we get a stronger directive from agent walker. 
Roger that. 
Yes,sir. We'll keep homeland 
apprised with real-time updates. 
Did you access the gps locator system? 
Yeah,I'm scanning transponders for the stolen fbi vehicle. 
How long will that take? 
As long as it takes for the satellite to reposition. 
When you spoke to larry,you mentioned an attack? 
The starkwood operative we're trying to find stole a canister of the bioweapon. 
I thought tony almeida destroyed all the weapons. 
Apparently not. 
how did this operative get past our perimeter? 
Shot and killed two of our agents. 
This is it. 
The suspect is getting off highway 42 at smoketree avenue. 
He's heading toward the industrial corridor. 
 Put me on the interagency channel. 
 Go ahead. 
All units,this is agent walker with fbi. 
Suspect has exited highway 42 at smoketree. 
He's heading north into the industrial corridor. 
Units in the vicinity,please respond. 
Renee,it's me. We're 
over smoketree right now. 
We're redirecting,and we'll tighten our pursuit. 
Got it. I'll reroute swat 
team alpha to the scene. 
Swat team alpha,we need to set up a roadblock at the fairfax county line. 
Dc metro's covering the district line in case he tries to double back. 
******** Sir. I have a visual. 
Yeah. Got him. 
Send us lower. 
yeah,he's pulling off the road. Get us down there now. 
renee,it's larry. Suspect is on 
foot. We can't wait for backup. 
 We're moving in right now. 
 All right. Swat team's a few minutes out. 
 Careful,larry. 
 Yeah. 
Remember,suspect has a canister,so pick your shots. 
If possible,let's take him alive. 
Yes,sir. 
we got to get out of here. 
Almeida,cover. Let's go. 
Come on! 
 relax. 
 I'm okay. 
Relax. 
Tony. 
tony! Tony! 
what... 
I'm sorry,larry. 
god... 
let me see it. 
How the hell do we get out of here? 
I want you to take this,find a place to hide. 
 Wait for my call. 
 What about you? 
I'm gonna wait on the fbi,figure out a way to get you out of here. Go! 
 Jack! 
 Put down your weapon. Now! 
What the hell's going on? 
 Where's Ryan Burnett? 
 What? 
Senator Mayer's chief of staff. 
Where is he? 
Tony doubled back to one of his contacts... 
who gave him information of a second attack. 
It's gonna take place here in Washington within the hour. 
Juma's operatives are carrying it out. 
Burnett's been supporting them all along. 
He knows where the attack's gonna take place. 
So you can either tell me where he is, or I will find him myself. 
 Mr. Burnett, you are a traitor and a terrorist. 
 I'm not. I love my country. 
    Mr. Bauer, this is President Taylor. 
Where's the target? 
Where's the target? 
What you're doing is against the law, Mr. Bauer. 
I am ordering you to stand down. 
Where is Take Mr. Bauer away. 
He's under arrest. 
You should have come to me. 
You should have presented your case. 
And would it really have made a difference, ma'am? 
   Colonel Dubaku is dead. 
Laurent must never know about this... 
or about his father's cowardice. 
There is no sign of my father. 
Let me take his place on the assault team. 
Spoken like a true Dubaku, Laurent. 
It is time for us to go. 
This is it, Larry. No question. 
They're moving out. 
 Any idea what the next target is? 
 No. 
From here, it is approximately 100 meters to the entrance. 
 The following takes place between 7:00 p.m. And 8:00 p.m. 
Put it there- this bag. 
Over there. 
Right there. 
Right there. 
 Let's move. 
 Yes, sir. Let's go. 
That's it. I need to see her right now. 
Ms. Taylor, the president will see you 
as soon as she's able. 
Well, you tell her her daughter is done waiting. 
I'm going to the hospital to be with my father. 
I think it'd be a good idea to talk to your mother before you do that. 
The president's orders are that you remain in the White House. 
So if I try to leave... 
you will actually physically restrain me? 
Now, that would never happen, Ms. Taylor. 
Because I know you have too much respect for your mother and her office... 
to ever let things get that far. 
Well done, Agent. 
You've been at this a while. 
 Five administrations, ma'am. 
  Olivia, your mother asked me to fill you in on what's happening. 
Well, with all due respect, Ethan, you're the last person she should be sending. 
There's about to be another terrorist attack on this city. 
That's why she wants you to remain here. 
You're talking about more planes going down? 
We don't know, but whatever's going to happen will happen soon. 
I'm heading to the Pentagon. 
On top of all of this... 
there's also the invasion to deal with. 
So bear in mind, your mother's under tremendous pressure right now. 
It's only a matter of time before the media picks up on the heightened security measures. 
I want to issue a statement before that happens. 
Play down the actual likelihood of an attack... 
talk about the security measures as being due diligence rather than No, Meredith. 
The public deserves the truth. 
We stress caution and calm... 
but we acknowledge we have intel about another terrorist action. 
Yes, ma'am. Angela and I will have something 
for you as soon as possible. 
    Madam President, Larry Moss is calling in. 
 He says he's got a lead on the attack. 
 Put him through. 
Agent Moss, you're on with the president. 
Madam President, we've discovered what we believe was a staging area... 
being used by terrorists on the south shore of the Potomac... 
near the I.T.P. Rail and shipyards. 
Madam President, we've identified one of the men as GeneralJuma. 
 What? Juma's in D.C. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
And we know that there are at least a dozen other men involved in the attack. 
And they are armed for a small war. 
Have you found evidence that tells us where the target might be? 
No, ma'am, but we have search teams out looking for the men... 
and we're hoping that Agent Walker has more information. 
She's the one who I.D.'d Juma, 
but, uh... 
we've lost contact with her. 
 Lost contact? 
 Yes, Madam President. 
But we have every reason to hope that she's still alive and in pursuit of the terrorists. 
If she's out there, ma'am, we'll find her. 
Hold it right there! 
I'm Agent Renee Walker, F.B.I. 
Agent Walker? 
We just got an alert on you. 
You need to call Larry Moss at F.B.I. Right now. 
Tell him there's gonna be a terrorist attack on the White House. 
Yes, ma'am. I'll call it in right away. 
This is Thompson  Ranger Thompson, please respond and report your location. 
Ranger Thompson. Ranger Thompson, 
please respond and report your location. 
Ranger Thompson. 
Bill. 
The Attorney General wants you transferred to his custody so I can file criminal charges. 
Have you learned anything else about the attack? 
I reached Tony. He couldn't get 
any more information from his guy. 
According to F.B.I., Renee Walker 
followed a lead on her own... 
to an abandoned warehouse on the Potomac. 
Got a visual on a heavily armed commando unit led byJuma himself. 
 But she went missing right after she called in. 
 What do you mean, missing? 
We're not sure. F.B.I. Searching the area, 
but there's no sign of her... 
 or any evidence telling us what the target might be. 
 Burnett knows. 
The president offered him an immunity deal. 
He turned it down. 
 Hasn't said a word since. 
 Damn it, Bill. He was talking 
when they stopped me. 
Put me in a room with him for five minutes, and we can stop this thing from happening. 
Jack, even if I was willing to release you, he's being transported to Kennedy Memorial. 
 You couldn't get access to him. 
 Fine. Then you do it. You can get access. 
 I'm not trained in coercive techniques. 
 This is not a maybe. 
Ryan Burnett is an accessory to a terrorist attack. 
If you don't do this, people will die. 
I'm not arguing about what needs to be done, but I can't do it. It's not me. 
 That's not good enough. 
 Jack. 
Damn it, Bill. That's not good enough. 
You were the one who told me people who stand by... 
they might as well help them plant the bomb. 
You can do this. 
Bill, you have to do this. 
I can't, Jack. I'm sorry. 
Bill. 
I can't. 
   This is it, General. 
Cimbe. 
We're on the other side of the conduit. 
Are you in position? 
Yes, General. 
I will be ready for you. 
   What was that? 
I thought I heard you say somethin'. 
Just, uh, talking to myself. 
Yeah. Hey, I tell you 
we're having people over on Saturday? 
Nothing fancy. 
We're bringing in Chinese. 
You think you're gonna make it this time? 
Oh, Chinese. 
I was looking forward to Sheila's cooking. 
 All clear, General. 
 Excellent. 
We'll have access in 10 seconds. 
Once we're in, we'll have two minutes... 
until the proximity alarms come back up. 
Five, four, three, two, one. 
Move! 
I've accessed the Secret Service tracking grid. 
Where is she? 
Right here, in the Oval Office. 
 Let's go. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Clear. 
 Keep moving. 
We will meet resistance, which we must counter quickly, silently. 
We have nine minutes until the next Secret Service roll call. 
We must find the president by then. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Keep me up on your status. 
Quiet. 
The president is preparing to issue a statement to clarify that. 
Yeah, I'll let you know as soon as it's ready for release. 
Let go of the phone. 
 Huh? 
  Five minutes until roll call, General. 
   Stay with me. 
 I'm on it. 
 Let's get this secure. 
Down that way. 
All the way around. All the way. 
Move it! Go! Go! 
   It's clear. 
Heads up. 10:00. 
Let's go. 
 Juma had your father killed. 
 What? 
Listen to me. I know that Dubaku 
is your father. Juma's been lying to you. 
 Your father is dead. 
 My father is alive! 
Juma had to make sure that your father didn't talk... 
so he sent a man named Udo to murder him. 
No. L- I don't believe you. 
I was there when Udo did it. 
That's how I found you by following him back to the railcar. 
GeneralJuma betrayed you. 
You are lying. 
You are lying! 
 Renee! 
  Set it up. 
I know the target! 
Reissued warrants and order for transport, sir. 
  Transport is set. Stand by. 
 Sorry, Jack. 
    This way, Mr. Bauer. 
 Bill Buchanan. 
 It's Larry Moss. 
Renee Walker says the target is the White House. 
 How good is her intel? 
 Firsthand. 
She says they're getting in via subterranean access. 
I'll initiate a lockdown. 
You alert C.I.R.G. 
This is Bill Buchanan. 
I have confirmation the White House is the target of a terrorist attack. 
Condition red. Repeat. Condition red. 
Secure the president. 
 Get to your posts. 
  All teams be advised. We have breach. 
Jack, I could use your help. 
I need to know you'll do exactly as I say. 
You have my word. 
 Where's the president now? 
 Oval Office. 
 What's the meaning of this? 
 You need to come with us. 
The White House is under attack. 
 What? 
 Madam President, we need to go. 
Ma'am, we need to go right now. 
Ms. Taylor. 
I've got the president's daughter. 
We're on our way to the lockdown. 
Men are down. 
There's no safe path out. 
 We need to secure her in the first floor lockdown. 
 Bill, we're clear. 
 What the hell is he doing here? 
 He's with me. 
Madam President, right now you need all the help you can get. 
How is this happening? 
Where's my daughter? 
Aaron Pierce is taking her to lockdown as we speak. But we need to move. 
Agents in zones five, seven and nine, please respond. 
Five, seven and nine, respond. 
I can't reach anyone in the quadrant. 
Juma's men are headed straight for us. 
They know where she is. 
They're tracking her, Bill. 
Madam President, let me see your tracker. 
 Bill, what's the most direct route to the lockdown? 
 From the east. 
I'll head west with the tracker and draw them away. You go with Jack. 
Mr. Bauer? 
This is your house. 
I'll follow. 
We're moving the president to lockdown. 
Agent Hovis, we've got agents down in multiple quadrants. 
 We need reinforcements, sir. 
 Copy that. 
We're on our way to the lockdown now. 
Let's go! 
General. 
The president has left the Oval Office. 
She's heading down the west corridor. 
Udo, take your team that way. 
We'll trap her in between us. 
We're getting close to the president, sir. 
Up ahead, around this corner. 
The president's tracker, sir. 
They know we're here. 
They're moving the president to the lockdown. 
Find her. 
Take him. We need hostages. 
Start gathering them. 
Let's move. 
 Cleared five. Seven! 
  Code red! Code red! 
Where? 
We've engaged hostiles on the way to the lockdown. 
We do not have a visual on the president. 
We're still two minutes away. 
    Don't shoot! 
Get up! 
Get up! 
 Move! Move! 
  Move it! Go! Go! 
Get up! 
Aaron, it's Jack. I'm with the president, 
approaching the lockdown. 
 Where are you? 
  We're still upstairs, Jack. 
Keep walking! 
 Shut up! Move! 
  Please! Let us go. 
Hostiles are in control of the area. 
Looking for a way past them to the lockdown. 
Copy that. Juma's men 
are closing in on our position. 
You're gonna have 30 seconds to get here before I have to seal this door. 
  Understood. 
 You will not close this door until my daughter gets here. 
Madam President, right now, your life is a priority whether you like it or not. 
 Please, step inside. 
  Madam President, are you all right? 
Aaron, it's Jack. 
We're sealed off in the lockdown. 
We came under attack. 
We didn't have a choice. 
We couldn't have made it anyway, Jack. 
 We'll try to find a way out of the building. 
 Copy that. Aaron 
   Jack. Jack, do you read me? 
Aaron, it's Jack. Do you copy? 
Damn it. Juma's cut off our communication. 
I need to know that my daughter's safe. 
Madam President, I can't answer that yet. 
Abo. 
Yes, sir. 
Let's roll! 
GeneralJuma. 
They brought in reinforcements. 
I don't know how much longer we can hold them off from your position. 
Stand by. 
Ngozi. 
Agents are moving in from all directions. 
We will be heavily outnumbered. 
Does Secret Service know their president is secured in the lockdown? 
The only ones who saw are dead. 
Put me on to their communications channel. 
   Go ahead, sir. 
This is GeneralJuma. 
I have the president. 
Evacuate immediately, or she will die. 
I need proof you have the president before I can give that order. 
 Let us speak to her. 
 Who is this? 
 Special Agent Hovis. 
 Agent Hovis. 
Move your men out of the building and beyond the fence line... 
or I will kill the president. 
And her death will be on your head. 
Agent Hovis? 
We're pulling back. 
All agents fall back immediately. 
Wilson here. Pulling back. 
I repeat: All agents, fall back. 
Copy that. Pull back. A II teams, pull back. 
    General, Secret Service is retreating. 
They are retreating, General. 
 All of them? 
 Yes, sir. 
Gather all the hostages and bring them here. 
Come on, move! 
 Lock down the exits. Move. 
 Sir. 
    Cimbe. Status report. 
Confirming Secret Service retreat in western quadrant. 
 Continue sweep. 
 Copy, General. 
The only reason Secret Service would retreat... 
is if they thoughtJuma had the president. 
But that man Bauer said he got my mother into the lockdown. 
Juma's bluffing them. 
We need to get out of here... 
and let our people know that as soon as possible so they can retake the building. 
Get out of here? How? 
They're everywhere. 
 Move it! 
 Get them in the back! 
Everyone keep moving! 
Keep your hands on your head. 
Move it! 
 Stop lagging! Let's go! 
 Move it! 
Move it! Move! 
 Move it! Come on! 
  Move it! 
Move your feet! 
 Right here! Come on! 
 Keep going! 
 Sit! 
 Everybody down! Get down! 
Turn around! 
Turn around! 
    Can you open it? 
Yes. Assuming the specifications 
Hodges gave us are correct. 
 How long? 
 Fifteen minutes. 
Right here, Agent. 
Copy. 
We confronted them in one of the first floor corridors. 
At that point, Juma ordered us to retreat... 
threatening to kill the president if we didn't comply. 
But he never gave a visual confirmation he was holding the president? 
He didn't, but I felt at that point, I had no choice but to pull back. 
His men were killing civilians and agents. 
Any idea how many people are still trapped inside? 
Cross-checking the evacuees with the White House manifest... 
so far, it looks like 53. 
 Any Secret Service? 
 As far as I know... 
we have no agents left in there still alive. 
Hostage rescue teams are moving into place. 
They'll be prepared to storm the building as soon as the order's given. 
Yeah, well, at this point, that order has to be given by the vice president. 
 What's his status? 
 Secret Service has him en route to a secure location. 
All right. Let me know 
as soon as he's locked down. 
And, Hovis, I need an infrared sat scan of the building. 
 Highest resolution possible. 
 Got it. 
You didn't tell me thatJack was in the White House. 
He was under arrest, being held under guard when the attack took place. 
Under arrest for what? 
He found out an aide to Senator Mayer named Burnett... 
was part of the conspiracy. 
He was caught torturing him in the White House. 
Almost killed the man before he was stopped. 
Renee, the president is our priority, notJack Bauer. 
 Are we clear on that? 
 Clear. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes. 
They're bringing in more hostages. 
 Get in there! 
 Sit down! 
Sit! No talking! 
 No talking! 
 Silence! 
I don't see Olivia. 
Madam President, that's good news. 
I know Aaron Pierce. 
He will do everything in his power to make sure that your daughter is safe. 
This is the White House, for God's sake. 
How was it possible that they were able to get around our security protocols? 
There's only one explanation. 
They had help on the inside. 
From whom? 
Oh, this is insane. 
Juma must realize that there's no way for him to get out of this alive. 
I'm afraid he does. 
This is his endgame. 
He came here to make a statement, and he's willing to die for it. 
As soon as the rescue teams realize that you're secure, they'll move in. 
It's only a matter of time. 
What's he doing? 
 Is that some kind of explosive? 
 No. 
 Mr. Bauer? 
 Oh, my God. 
   They've got the access codes. 
 I need to get into that panel. 
 Is there something I can do? 
Yeah. Get me that toolbox over there. 
Put it on the table. 
Damn it. 
Madam President, plug the cord into the wall, please. 
Now. 
Okay. 
General. 
 What's wrong? 
 It just went dead. 
Somehow, they must have disabled the circuitry from inside. 
Do we use C-4 to blow open the door? 
We'll have to drill sinkholes into each of the 11 locking rods. 
It would take too long. 
Depending on how the steel is hardened, C-4 might not even work. 
Then you will find another way. 
There can be no room for doubt. 
We have the president trapped. 
We open up that door, we become a part of history. 
We will find another way. 
  Despite previous predictions... 
  American forces have met surprisingly little resistance... 
in establishing a protective ring around Sangala City. 
Top military leaders are pleased with the progress Yes. 
Oh. Just a moment. 
Call came in on the dedicated uplink. 
 I heard it. 
 It's him, sir. 
Put him on speaker. 
General, didn't expect to be hearing from you directly. 
 What is it I can do for you? 
 We have a problem. 
The president is secured in the lockdown. 
Well, we prepared you for that possibility. 
We gave you the specs for the locking mechanism. 
They shorted the lock out from the inside. 
I need you to find me another way in. 
General, I've given you everything I have to give. 
My part in this thing's over. 
Are you forgetting that you don't have the shipment yet? 
Now, General, I expect you to be an honorable man. 
We made a deal. 
We held up our end of the bargain. 
We got you in the White House. 
I expect you to hold up yours. 
I don't care about your expectations. 
You help me, or I will destroy that shipment before it ever arrives to you. 
Hang on. 
Well, Seaton, what do you think? 
Can he do what he says? 
Shipment's not due in the port for another two hours. 
His men will have plenty of time to destroy it... 
render it useless. 
General, tell me. 
Who else is in the lockdown with the president? 
My men saw her enter with another man. 
Well, I'm looking at the White House manifest. 
And according to this, Olivia Taylor is presently in the building with you. 
The president's daughter? 
Are you sure? 
Their system logs everyone in and out electronically. 
If it says that she's in there, she's in there. 
Now, you find Olivia Taylor, and you'll get the president to open that door. 
Your shipment will arrive as planned. 
Thank you. 
There, you see? Stress. 
Stress is the fertilizer of creativity. 
Let's play some darts. 
The president's daughter is somewhere in the White House. 
Let's find her. 
Raise your heads. 
Show me your faces. 
Silent. 
Eyes down. 
What do you think's going on? 
I asked you a question, Mr. Buchanan. 
You think I made the wrong call with Bauer. 
You think that if I'd signed off on him torturing Ryan Burnett... 
all of this could have been avoided? 
You don't know what I'm thinking, Senator. 
Your hands where I can see them. 
She's not here. 
Go and find her and bring her to me. 
Our orders are to hold tight and wait for them. 
What happened? 
What'd you see? 
 Door's guarded. 
 There's gotta be another way out. 
There are only three exits to this wing, and they're all covered. 
The windows are sealed and hardened- unbreakable. 
We have to let them know the terrorists are bluffing, that they don't have my mother. 
Our only option is to get a signal out. 
 We can do it from the windows of the residence. 
 Okay, good. 
You'll be safer if I leave you in a secure area. 
I'll get the signal out and come back for you. 
I'm not gonna sit and hide in some damn vent, Agent Pierce. 
Ma'am, it is a long way, and we're probably gonna encounter more ofJuma's men. 
 It's too dangerous. 
 I don't care. 
I'm going with you, and don't try to argue. 
We don't have the time. 
Okay. Stay behind me. 
   Inside. 
Agent Moss, sat scan's all set up here. 
We can see the cluster of hostages, but not the individual bodies. 
The best they can do? 
They can't boost the resolution? 
No, sir. The White House is one of the most 
heavily shielded buildings in the world. 
  You copy? 
 Yeah, I got it. 
Vice president's ready. 
They're initiating communication. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah. 
  Give us the room. 
  Yes, sir. 
You're on with the vice president. 
Mr. Vice President, 
I'm Special Agent Moss... 
head of the F.B.I. D.C. Branch. 
This is Agent Walker. 
I've been briefed on the general situation. 
What are the latest facts on the ground? 
There's nothing further from GeneralJuma... 
but an infrared scan of the building shows he's holding the hostages... 
in a hallway outside the Roosevelt Room. 
 This is very possibly good news for the president. 
 Explain. 
The area's not one of the more defensible places in the building. 
Tactically, it makes no sense forJuma to have chosen it as a base. 
However, the area is adjacent to the ground floor lockdown... 
which we know the president was en route to. 
So you think the president made it into the lockdown? 
That's our best explanation for him being there. 
We're therefore asking you to authorize the rescue operation... 
beforeJuma manages to penetrate the lockdown. 
Do you have any other evidence... 
that supports your theory that the president is in the lockdown? 
There's the fact that he couldn't produce the president... 
when we asked him to prove that he had her. 
Couldn't or wouldn't? 
You can't be certain which one it is, can you? 
Certainty is not possible in this case, sir. 
We're giving you our best estimation... 
and we urge you to allow us to launch. 
What if you're wrong? 
What ifJuma does have the president? 
He will kill her as soon as he realizes what you're doing. 
Inaction has its own risks too, sir. 
The more timeJuma has to reinforce his position... 
the more difficult it'll be to take the building and to save lives. 
I understand... 
but my priority must be the president's life. 
Prudence dictates that I hold off on authorizing the rescue operation... 
till we can be more certain of her status. 
Mr. Vice President, terrorists 
are in control of the White House. 
I would ask you to consider if prudence is the appropriate response in this situation. 
I thank you for your thoughts, Agent Walker. 
But until you can provide me with more intel on what's goin'on in there... 
you are instructed to refrain from launching any action. 
Keep me apprised of any further developments. 
 All he's interested in is covering his own ass. 
 He's the vice president. 
Right now, he's calling the shots. 
It was the right call, sir. 
You can't order an operation that results in the president's death... 
and your own elevation to the job. 
It would be politically untenable. 
Never let anyone hear you talkin' like that, Derek. 
 Understood? 
 Yes, sir. 
Oh! 
Oh, my God, Aaron. 
They would've heard those shots, so you're gonna need to get the signal out before they get back. 
There's a security kit behind that door in the bureau. 
It's got first aid and a flashlight. 
You'll flash Morse code out the window. 
Reach in my jacket. 
I got a pen. 
Here. Give it to me. 
Give me your hand. 
This is called "code green." 
A dot is a short blink. A dash is a long one. 
Code green will signal them to move in. 
Go. 
 General Juma, I have the president's daughter. 
  Bring her to me. 
 Bring him. 
  Come on. Get up. 
Get up! Go! 
Go on. 
 (HDTV SUBTITLES FROM HERE)  added by w3sten Sources have confirmed that the siege inside the white house began approximately 40 minutes ago. 
We do not yet have confirmation on the number of hostages being held, or if the president is among them. 
Behind me, you can see dozen of tactical assault units standing by. 
Government analysts tell us the order to launch any operation in these circumstances would rest with the vice president. 
General, I discovered fiber-optic cameras embedded in the chandelier. 
 Get me a chair. 
 Yes, general. 
He spotted the cameras. 
Give me a secure channel. 
Go ahead, sir. 
President taylor, I see now that you've been watching us. 
Good. There is something 
I think you should see. 
God, no. 
If you don't open the door, I'm going to cut out your daughter's eyes one by one. 
And then I'm going to cut out her tongue... 
 and then her head. 
 Mom, don't listen! 
I know what you're thinking. 
How do you know if you open the door that I won't kill her? 
All you need to know is that I most certainly will kill her if you don'T. 
 open the door. 
 Madam president,  No.Open the door.Open the door! 
 I can't! I can't! 
That is my daughter out there. Do you understand? 
I've already lost my son. 
Have you any idea what it's like to lose a child? 
Madam president, I am genuinely sorry, but I cannot let them take you. 
There is nothing you can do for her now. 
Do you have children, Jack? 
I have a daughter. 
Could you do what you're asking me to do? 
Ju stand by and watch her butchered? 
No, ma'am. But I am not the 
president of the united states. 
Well, i am the president. 
And I am ordering you to open that door. 
You're running out of time. 
mom... 
perhaps this will make your mother decide more quickly. 
mom, you shouldn't have... 
I wouldn't let them hurt you, darling. 
Damn it, bauer. What have you done? 
all right, general, you've got me now. 
There's no reason to hold anyone else. 
Let them go. 
You... don't give orders to me. 
Get the camera ready for her statement. 
What statement? 
The last one you'll ever give. 
What the hell is this? All our screens 
for the eastern quadrant are locked. 
I took out your control units. 
I want you to see what we can do. 
Get ready to make the course change. 
 G.S.A. 117, this is Northeast Three Control. 
 Go ahead, Air Traffic Control. 
We have a new runway assignment for you. 
Sid, there's another plane landing on 4 Right. 
It crosses 31 Left. 
G.S.A. 117, pull up. 
4 Right, pull up. 
That was just a warning shot. 
Whatever we do next, it'll be the real thing. 
 Get the module ready. 
  As promised. 
GeneralJuma will be pleased. 
Perhaps now would be a good time to make your demands known to President Taylor. 
Make the preparations. 
Your government is about to pay... 
a very steep price for interfering in our affairs. 
They assumed my son killed himself. 
They didn't look deeply enough at anything. 
The authorities have already questioned your son's girlfriend, sir. 
You're not going anywhere till I get the truth. 
 Sir. 
 You know who murdered my son. 
He killed himself. 
I'm gonna find out what you're hiding. 
And when I do, God help you. 
You're right. 
He's not one of ours. 
 We'll follow him, see if he leads us to Almeida. Dornan! 
 That's not the right move. 
You can't bring anyone else into this. 
 What the hell's goin' on? 
We're following up on a lead, and I will fill you in if and when we find something. 
I do not like this. 
I just flat-out lied to my boss. 
I told you I would help you find Tony Almeida, but you're gonna have to let me do it my way. 
Tony! Stop! 
The device is gone. 
The locator files have been deleted. 
Where is it? 
What the hell happened to you? 
 The following takes place between 10:00 a.m. And 11:00 a.m. 
 Where's Almeida now? 
 He's in transit to F.B.I. Headquarters. 
 He'll be formally interrogated there. 
 I don't understand. 
Almeida was orchestrating these attacks. 
Lfhe doesn't have the C.I.P. Device, 
who does? 
 The F.B.I. Has learned that Almeida 
handed off the device to someone else. 
 They don't know who. 
 I may have an answer to that question, Madam President. 
 I'm listening. 
 Almeida's working for theJuma regime. 
Approximately five minutes ago, an audio message was routed to the State Department subnet. 
It's from Colonel Ik� Dubaku. 
He's Juma's right-hand man. 
He's known as the Butcher of Sangala. 
 Over 300,000 people were murdered. 
 I know who he is. 
What did the message say? 
Think you should hear it yourself. 
President Taylor, this is Colonel Ik� Dubaku. 
As you have no doubt confirmed... 
the near collision atJ.F.K. 
International was no accident. 
We have the C.I.P. Device. 
We have the capability... 
to kill tens of thousands of Americans... 
and we are prepared to do so. 
We demand the complete and immediate withdrawal of the U.S. Naval strike force... 
to a position west of the 23rd meridian by this time tomorrow. 
In order to meet this timeline... 
we require satellite confirmation within three hours... 
that the carrier air wing is in full retreat. 
Don't sacrifice your fellow countrymen... 
Madam President. 
Allow the people of Sangala to determine their own destiny. 
Stand your forces down. 
Voiceprint's an 89% match. 
It's Dubaku. 
 There's little doubt. 
 Looks like your suspicions were correct, Madam President. 
 This is about Africa. 
 My God. 
Dubaku should have been tried for war crimes years ago. 
Now he's giving us ultimatums. 
We cannot let this monster hold our country hostage. Where do we stand on the planes? 
There's still 2,500 planes in the air. 
We have got to shore up the firewall... 
so that the C.I.P. Device 
will be rendered useless. 
We now think we can reengineer the code in six days. 
Six days? We don't have 
the luxury of six hours. 
I'm sorry, Madam President, but there's no way we can rebuild the firewall in that time frame. 
I want you to instigate a series of restricted alerts. 
Keep it to first responders only. 
We want people to be ready in case we're attacked again... 
 but we don't want to start a panic. 
 Yes, Madam President. 
And gentlemen, Almeida is our only lead. 
Make sure the F.B.I. 
Is aware of the demands. 
They need to work Almeida from the Africa side... 
 and they need to know we don't have a lot of time. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
Come on. 
Keep your head down. 
Get him ready for questioning. 
I want an explanation. 
You went after that shooter without backup or authorization, and then refused to tell me why. 
 Now, I wanna know. 
 Look, we didn't know who might be listening. 
 Someone in this office is helping Almeida. 
 What? 
The F.B.I. Has been compromised, Larry. 
There's a leak. 
Based on what? 
Excuse me! This is private. 
Tony knew we were going to Schector's office before we even got there. 
That's how he managed to get a sniper in position. 
The tip had to come from your office. 
And whoever it was helped Schector's assassin get out of the building. 
He's right, Larry. 
That's why we couldn't tell you. 
You had a full perimeter, right? 
Covered every exit? 
How else do you think he got out of there? 
All right. Assuming this is true, 
you got any idea who it could be? 
No. We didn't see it. 
But we know that it went down. 
It could be anyone in the Bureau. 
You need to tighten your circle around Tony. 
You can't let any information that he gives you get back to the people he's working with... 
otherwise you will never get that C.I.P. Device. 
 All right. 
  We'll limit access to Level Four clearance and above. 
HaveJanis run the security protocols. 
 See if she can track down this lead. 
   It's Moss. 
  Sir, I have the White House calling. 
 Yeah, I'll I'll take it in my office. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Yeah. 
  It's the White House. 
From now on, keep me in the loop. 
And he doesn't do a damn thing without telling me. 
 We had to tell him. We had no choice. 
 You trust him? 
No question. 
There's no one I trust more. 
Where are they gonna hold Tony? 
I am gonna have to lift up your shirt. 
Is that comfortable for you? 
Take that as a yes. 
  Is he hooked up? 
  Yeah, we're ready to go. 
Janis, I'll run this session. 
I want you to handle something else. 
 What else? 
 Plugging a security leak. 
What? 
We think someone in this office has been helping Almeida. 
They've kicked this up to Level Four clearance. 
I want you to vet all communication and information flow. 
Red tag every data point that has to do with Almeida. 
 Okay. Well, do we have 
any idea who it is? 
 No, we don't. 
I'm hoping you can help us find out. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, there's a 0.2 deviation 
on the blood pressure monitor... 
and you're gonna have to compensate for that. 
Thanks, Janis. 
Sorry about your friend, Jack. 
I know you were hoping... 
he wasn't capable of doing something like this. 
Yeah. 
 Hey, what's going on? 
Why are we in Level Four lockdown? 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Just do your job. 
 How am I supposed to do my job... 
when I can't get through to half the server nodes in the building? 
You're sifting through the evidence gathered at Almeida's arrest site. 
That does not require Level Four clearance. 
You have everything you need to do your work. Please. 
Nichols. 
It's confirmed. 
The F.B.I. Has Almeida. 
Then we should move on. 
There's nothing we can do. 
No. We have assets inside the Bureau. 
We use them to help get him out. 
No, it's too risky. We'd be 
jeopardizing the entire mission. 
 Almeida's not that important. 
 What about the next operation? Tony's prepped. 
 He's ready to go. 
 You'll just have to find someone else. 
I realize you and Tony are friends. 
I don't like throwing him to the wolves any more than you do. 
But he knew what he was getting into. 
I just spoke with Juma. The American troops 
are still in position near our country. 
TellJuma to be patient. 
President Taylor just received your demands. 
Then perhaps it is time for a more forceful demonstration. 
If it comes to that, we'll be ready. 
For now, let's give the White House a little more time to respond. 
For now. 
    Agent Walker. 
Almeida's working for theJuma regime. 
 What are you talking about? 
 The president just received a set of demands. 
 They're from Colonel Ik� Dubaku. 
 Dubaku? 
Looks like he contracted Almeida to build the C.I.P. Module. 
 And now, he's using it to blackmail the White House. 
 How? 
 Excuse me? 
 How is he gonna blackmail the White House? 
By insisting we stand down the invasion force off the coast of Sangala. 
If the president doesn't comply with his demands... 
Dubaku is gonna start killing Americans. 
I can get you your C.I.P. Device. 
Just let me talk to him. 
I know him. I know how he thinks. 
We have a history. 
I can use it against him. 
He's gotten us this far, Larry. 
It makes sense. 
You're running out of time. 
You don't have a better option. 
    Give us the room. 
I watched you die in my arms. 
You want to explain to me how you're still alive? 
 Didn't think so. 
Why don't I tell you what I know. 
I know that you're working for theJuma regime. 
The White House just got their demands... 
and you have to know that I will never let that happen. 
So why don't you save yourself some time... 
and some pain... 
and tell me where the C.I.P. Device is. 
 I can't tell you that, Jack. 
 Damn it, Tony. 
You are not just facing charges for domestic terrorism. 
You are gonna face international charges for aiding and abetting a genocide. 
They will give you the death penalty. 
Come on. Just work with me on this. 
I could help you cut a deal. 
I can maybe even get you immunity. 
You're wasting your breath, Jack. 
If I were you... 
I'd tell the president to withdraw those troops, because Dubaku's serious. 
He's ready to take thousands of American lives unless his demands are met. 
Why the hell are you doing this? 
Juma wanted the C.I.P. Module, 
and he was willing to pay for it. 
 I don't believe you. 
 Come on, Jack. 
Don't act so surprised. 
Money is the only reason I have left for doin' anything. 
The government took care of that. 
The government did not kill Michelle. 
Charles Logan did. 
Charles Logan is a product of his environment. 
The government poisons everything in its path. 
You know that better than me, Jack. 
Look what they did to you. 
Damn it, Tony! 
We are not talking about me! 
Oh, we're not? 
You're asking me why I'm doing this. 
I could ask you the same question. 
Here you are, working for the same people who wanna put you in prison. 
The same people who killed everything you love and left you with nothing. 
 Your daughter wants nothing to do with you, Teri's dead  Shut up. 
 Audrey Raines, Miles  I said shut up! 
No, Jack! No! You need to hear this! 
You need to start living in the real world! 
Because every second you help the government, you're spittin' on Teri's grave! 
Get up! 
 He's losing it. 
 Hold on. Hold on. 
 Tell me where the device is! 
  So help me God, I will kill you, and you will stay dead this time. 
Where is the device? 
This is your last chance. 
Where is it? 
 Where is it? 
  Deep Sky. 
What did you just say? 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Give him a few more seconds. 
 Few more seconds, he'll be dead. 
 Deep Sky. 
Jack, let him go! 
Get him out ofhere! 
   Get him out of here, now! 
I need a medic in here to check him out. 
 Keep an eye on him. 
 You got it. 
   Deep Sky. 
Hello. 
 This is Jack Bauer. 
 Yes? 
 I was told to call you. 
 By whom? 
Tony Almeida. 
He gave me this old C.T.U. 
Emergency phone code- Deep Sky. 
It's Bill, Jack. 
Bill, what the hell's going on? 
 Where is Tony? 
 F.B.I. Headquarters. He's been arrested. 
Arrested? 
He orchestrated a terrorist attack on the United States today. 
I was interrogating him. 
 How'd you get involved in this? 
 The F.B.I. Brought me in to help track him down. 
We need to talk, Jack. 
I'll call you back on a secure V.P.N. Line. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 I need 10 minutes to set up the V.P.N. Line. 
 I don't have 10 minutes! 
 Ten minutes, Jack. 
I can't believe this. 
LfTony's been arrested, it's over. 
Are you gonna tellJack everything? 
We wanna get Tony back undercover, we'll need his help. 
I don't thinkJack's in a very helpful frame of mind. 
He's our only hope. 
 Hello, Henry. 
 Ethan. 
I got your message about Sangala. 
 Where's Allison? 
 She's in her office. 
Henry The president is in an impossible situation right now. 
She needs your support, but you can't give it to her... 
if you keep going off on these paranoid fantasies about Roger. 
I know about Samantha Roth. 
I know you accosted her in her office. 
She's hiding something about my son's murder. 
Roger wasn't murdered. 
He committed suicide. 
The coroner's office made that determination, and the F.B.I. Confirmed it. 
They didn't look hard enough. 
Ethan, I know my son. 
He did not kill himself. 
 He wasn't depressed. He had no reason. 
 What if he did have a reason? 
 I would have known. 
 Not if he didn't tell you. 
Not if he was too ashamed to tell you or the president. 
What are you talking about? 
Roger was about to be investigated by the S.E.C. For insider trading. 
He'd used information he could only have gotten... 
through his access to the president. 
Before the S.E.C. Opened the investigation, 
he killed himself. 
I don't believe it. 
It's all in here... 
in the S.E.C. Case file. 
Why is this the first time I'm hearing about this? 
Frank Boylan agreed to bury the case... 
as a political favor to the president. 
My wife knew about this, and she didn't tell me? 
She wanted to. But she also wanted 
to protect your memory of your son. 
 You were in so much pain  Damn it, Ethan, he was my son. 
I deserved the truth. 
And keeping it from you was a terrible mistake. 
I realize that now. 
But the president and I both thought... 
you were moving on with your life. 
Mr. Kanin. 
The president wants to see you. 
Does she know you're telling me this now? 
No. And I think it best 
we keep it that way... 
at least till this crisis is resolved. 
I felt I had to tell him, sir. 
I'm sorry. 
All right. Thank you. 
Madam President, you wanted to see me? 
Admiral Smith laid out the timeline for withdrawing our forces. 
He's saying to meet Dubaku's demands... 
we need to order the pullback by 1:00 p.m. 
  That's not much time. 
 No, it isn't. 
Well, maybe this man Almeida will tell us where to find the C.I.P. Device. 
No. Tim Woods 
just heard from the Bureau. 
So far, Almeida's refusing to cooperate. 
 Well, maybe he's just positioning for a deal. 
 Tim doesn't think so. 
He said we shouldn't count on Almeida to talk. 
I see. 
So... 
unless I order our forces to stand down... 
I'll be condemning innocent Americans to death. 
And if we capitulate... 
thousands of Sangalans will be slaughtered. 
How did this happen, Ethan? 
How could we have been so caught off guard? 
And now, to have to decide between two impossible choices. 
Well, at least one of those choices... 
does stand a good chance of preserving American lives. 
 You mean withdrawal. 
 We are nearing the time where we may have to consider it. 
We're not there yet, Ethan. 
I can't discuss this... 
not until we have explored every possible option. 
Tell the F.B.I. To keep 
working on Almeida. 
Yes, Madam President. 
Mr. Buchanan, 
I've got the secure line. 
 All right. Dial the number. 
  Bill, stop screwin' around. 
Tell me what the hell is going on. 
Jack, Tony is not a terrorist. He's working 
deep cover. He's working with me. 
We have proof that he tried to bring down two commercial airliners. 
You don't know the whole story. 
It's part of an ongoing operation. 
Operation? What kind of an operation puts 
hundreds if not thousands of lives in danger? 
Jack, please. You need to listen. 
Our government is corrupted. 
There are people on the inside who are actively aiding Dubaku and theJuma regime. 
Point is, Tony was supposed to be near the C.I.P. Module the whole time. 
With him in custody, we've lost our ability to control it and to attack this conspiracy. 
Who's a part of the conspiracy? 
Give me names. 
We don't know the extent of it, but we have reason to believe... 
that members of the president's inner council are on payroll. 
Who's shepherding the investigation? 
Which agency? 
That's just it, Jack. 
There's no shepherd. 
There's no agency. 
This corruption runs deep and wide. 
We're working outside the government. 
That's why we have to get Tony back undercover. 
He's at F.B.I. Headquarters, Bill. 
I never said it was gonna be easy. 
But we have to try. 
 Chloe's already into their system. 
 Chloe's working on this? 
 Hi, Jack. It's good to hear your voice. 
 Yeah, you too. 
I saw the hearings on C-SPAN. 
I can't believe what the senator said to you. 
You looked good, though. 
 Jack, we need your help to get Tony out of there. 
There's an agent at the F.B.I. 
Renee Walker. 
 She could help. 
 No, the F.B.I. Been compromised. 
Somebody in the Bureau is aiding Dubaku. 
You don't understand, Bill. 
I trust her. 
If you think you need to use her to get Tony out of F.B.I. Headquarters, then do it. 
But you'll be making her a target. 
No, you're right. 
You're right. We'll do it your way. 
I can get to Tony myself. 
 But Chloe's gonna have to get us out of the building. 
 We're already on it. 
 Get back to me as soon as you're ready. 
 I'm on my way, Chloe. 
Hey, Sean, you know those data-mining plug-ins we downloaded last week? 
Where did we file those? 
Where did we file those? 
Uh, yeah. 
File folder A-76. 
 Do you need help with something? 
 No. Why? 
You seem confused. 
I just don't like havin' to dance around this Level Four lockdown. 
Oh. I thought you'd welcome the opportunity 
to complain about something. 
   Hello? 
Mr. Taylor, it's Samantha. 
I was going to call you. 
I owe you an apology, Sam. 
 I was wrong to confront you like that. 
 Uh, no, you weren't. 
 I wasn't completely honest with you. 
 What do you mean? 
Roger didn't commit suicide, Mr. Taylor. 
He was murdered. 
I need to see you, alone. 
Will you meet me? 
Of course. 
Where's the C.I.P. Device, Tony? 
Who'd you give it to? 
The people you're taking money from thought you'd might like to see some of their handiwork. 
You know how many people they've killed since they went back into Sangala? 
Huh? 
200,000 and counting. 
Most of them women and children. 
Tony. 
You really want this on your conscience? 
My conscience is clear. 
And nothing you can say or do will change that. 
So why don't you do the smart thing... 
and tell President Taylor to stand down the strike force. 
Because unless she does, planes will be falling from the sky. 
And then you'll have a whole new batch of photos to look at. 
Only this time... 
they'll be of dead Americans. 
Larry, we need to talk. 
     Almeida's not gonna break. 
 We don't know that. 
He's a trained C.T.U. Agent. 
He's conducted interrogations just like this one. 
There's nothing you can say to him that he hasn't said himself a hundred times. 
 So what are you suggesting? We give up? 
 No. 
I'm suggesting we might need a more forceful approach. 
 You mean torture. 
 There are methods of coercion we haven't even considered. 
 Pharmaceuticals  I can't believe you want to have this conversation. 
 You're not hearing the argument. 
 The argument is crazy. 
It's illegal, and it's over. 
As a matter of fact, I want Bauer out of here. 
He's a wild card. He's dangerous. 
I want him out of the building. 
Go. Process him out. 
I will continue here. 
Go, go, now. 
Renee, I was just about to call you. 
I may have found the leak. 
Someone did a runaround on the Level Four lockdown. 
They circumvented the security fence and they hacked into the F.A.A. Database. 
 F.A.A. Are you sure? 
 Positive. I don't know what 
they were doing in there... 
but they had to navigate some very sophisticated tagger software. 
 When was this? 
 Just a few minutes ago. 
 Any idea who it was? 
 No, but I might be able to pull a user I.D. Out of the terminal. 
 Okay. Which terminal? 
 Mainframe room, terminal three. 
 Check it out. Let me know what you find. 
 Okay. 
Agent Teller. I need you to prepare 
a debriefing packet forJack Bauer. 
 And bring me his personal effects. 
 I'll bring 'em right to you. 
Thanks. 
I'll be in my office. 
       What are you doin'? 
What's the matter? 
S-You just stay where you are. 
Janis, stop it. 
Would you just talk to me? 
I know you've been helping Tony Almeida. 
What? 
Are you crazy? 
No. You broke into the F.A.A. Database. 
That's your server I.D. 
Yeah, it's my server I.D., 
but I'm not helping the terrorists. 
You wanna know why I was in there? 
I'll tell you. 
I was worried. My wife is on one of 
those planes up there. 
 I had to see if her flight had been grounded yet. 
 You expect me to believe that? 
 Why are you sneaking around? 
 Because of the Level Four lockdown. 
It cut me out of the F.A.A. Database. 
I couldn't monitor her flight. 
Look. 
See for yourself. 
   Flight 112 out of Las Vegas. 
 Christina Hillinger. 
 Okay. Just stay there. 
God, Sean! 
You scared the hell out of me! 
Why wouldn't you just tell me that? 
'Cause what I was doin' was borderline illegal. 
I didn't wanna get you in trouble. 
Plus, you looked like you had enough on your plate. 
Damn it, I told Renee I'd found a security leak. 
Is that what's going on around here? 
There's a security leak? 
Don't worry about it. 
Go back to your station. 
Keep this to yourself, and I will clean up your mess. 
Go. 
   Idiot. 
   Go ahead. 
Jack, Agent Walker is on her way. She's 
heading down the corridor toward your room. 
Copy that. 
How you doing with the loops? 
I'm dropping the first one in now. 
I have a series of loops. 
I'm gonna drop them as you go. 
Security won't see a thing. 
  That's all right. 
I'll take it from here. 
 Understand. 
Standing by. 
Hey. 
Sorry, Jack. We're proceeding without you. 
It wasn't my decision. 
We wouldn't have Almeida without you. 
We owe you a lot. 
Thanks. 
 That paperwork for me? 
 Yeah. Need you to fill this out. 
I want you to know I'm gonna put in a good word with theJustice Department for you. 
 Maybe it'll help. 
 Thanks. 
Jack! 
 Don't fight it. 
 Jack! 
Don't fight it. 
 Jack just took out Agent Walker. 
He has her key card and her weapon. 
He's going to get Tony. 
What's your location? 
 About 10 minutes out. 
 Did you get my rendezvous point? 
   Just showed up on my G.P.S. 
 Okay, great. 
  I've gotta go. It's Jack. 
Jack? 
I'm ready. 
I've got access to Interrogation One. 
 What's Bill's E.T.A. 
 About 10 minutes. 
 How's the corridor? 
 Clear. 
Wait for my call. 
     Put your weapons down. Now! 
 What the hell do you think you're doing? 
I said do it now! 
 Do it, or I will kill him. 
 Okay. A II right. 
 Put it down. It's all right. Do it. 
 Slowly. 
Slowly! 
Now you. 
Do it! 
All right. 
All right. 
Kick your weapon over to me. 
 Come on! 
 Okay. All right. 
Uncuff him. 
 Where's Agent Walker? What did you do to her? 
 Shut up. 
 Bauer, you're not gonna make it out of here. 
 I said shut up! 
 I talked to Bill. 
 How much did he tell you? 
Enough. We're gonna get you out of here. 
Chloe's tapped into their security. 
She's gonna walk us out of this building. 
 All you need to do is follow my lead. 
 All right. 
 Chloe, it's Jack. Do you copy? 
 Copy, Jack. 
I got Tony at the door of Interrogation One leading out to the hallway. 
Okay, I see you. I'm gonna 
direct you to the southwest exit. 
Right now, you're in the least populated area of the building... 
but you're gonna run into a lot more resistance before you get out of there. 
 Copy that. You ready? 
  Clear to move. 
Let's go. 
Hold up. There's two people 
coming out of the elevator. 
Copy that. Come on. 
Listen, Jack, I'm sorry about the stuff I said back there. 
I just needed to get you close enough to give you Bill's code name. 
I'm just glad I didn't break your neck. 
Well, uh, you came close. 
Yeah. 
Sorry about that. 
  Okay, clear. 
 We're clear. 
I cleaned up your trail. So we'll just keep 
this little transgression between us. 
Although I don't know what I'm gonna tell Renee. 
Have you heard one thing I've just said? 
Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. 
Take a look at this. 
 What? 
 There's a performance hit on one of our signal routers. 
It's down 0.7%. 
You're right. 
Somebody's riding our bandwidth. 
Hacking in? Is that possible 
with all the safeguards? 
Anything is possible if you know what you're doing. 
They're inside our security subnet. 
They've accessed the surveillance system. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Lock them out. 
Okay, Jack, you're gonna make a left down the next hallway. 
There's an emergency stairwell at the end. 
 Will that stairwell get us down to the ground level? 
 Yes. 
Copy that. 
 Hold on. 
 What's wrong? 
 I've lost my feed. 
 Chloe's feed just went down. 
What'd you do? 
I pinged the line, and it automatically reset. 
Someone was hacking in. 
They were taking out our surveillance cameras. 
 Janis, take a look at this. 
 Send it to me. 
   Security, this is Janis Gold. 
We have a code 12 in progress. 
We need a team to Interrogation One. 
Yes, ma'am. Right away. 
    All agents, security breach, code 12. 
 We gotta keep moving. Let's go. 
 Security breach, code 12. 
Security team's between us and the southwest exit. 
Chloe, what have you got? 
We're boxed in. 
Someone at F.B.I. Blocking my every move. 
It's really starting to piss me off. 
You need to get back into their system. 
Otherwise, we're not gonna make it out of here. 
Jack, I'm sorry. 
I'm trying. 
All nonsecurity personnel  We gotta make a move, Jack. 
 I know. 
 Copy that. 
 Okay. 
Let's go. 
 Come on, Chloe. Talk to me. 
 I'm still locked out. Trying to work around it. 
 Jack, we're sitting ducks if we stay here. 
 I know. 
Chloe, we have to take the stairwell. 
We don't have a choice. 
 Quietly. 
  All clear! 
Where are they? 
 We're lookin'. 
 Find 'em! 
Ow! 
 You all right? 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 They're still in the building. 
We're trying to locate them. 
 I can't believe this. 
 What the hell is Jack doing? 
 He's helping his friend escape. 
 That's what he's doing. 
 I'mI'm sorry, Larry. 
I shouldn't have trusted him. 
 It's all right. 
 I got 'em! 
 Southwest stairwell. 
Security, this is Agent Moss. 
Suspects are in the southwest stairwell... 
descending past the fifth floor. 
Lock down the building perimeter and deploy two teams in the first floor service corridor. 
Be aware. The suspects are armed. 
We need 'em alive. 
 Okay, I'm back up, Jack. 
 Copy that. 
 What was that? 
 Hacker's back in. 
 Whoever this is, they're very good. 
 Well, lock 'em out. 
I'm trying! 
 Jack, hold up. 
 What is it? 
You're heading into an ambush. 
It's a six man team. 
 They're heading up toward you on the stairwell. 
 Understand. We'll evade. 
 They're coming up the stairs. 
  Pass me that fire extinguisher. 
 We're on the roof of the parking lot. 
 I see you. Good work. 
Go to the north end, Jack. 
Bill's almost there. He's in a blue van. 
Copy that. 
They're outside. They went through 
the third floor window. Let's go! 
Perimeter teams, they're in the parking garage. 
Notify Metro Police. I want them 
to cordon off a five-block perimeter. 
On our right! 
Get down! 
We gotta get you out of here and back undercover. 
I'll be right behind you. 
Go! 
Go! Go! 
They went inside. Let's go! 
This is gonna hurt. 
Tony, let's go! 
Come on, Jack! 
Get in. 
Let's go, Bill! 
Agent Moss, they're gone. 
They got outside the perimeter. 
All right, Chloe, I got 'em. 
 Any sign of pursuit? 
 Not so far. They must still be mobilizing. 
 We caught them off guard. 
 Traffic cams? 
I'm cycling frequencies to clear a path now. 
Good. Are you all right? 
 I'm fine. Where are we going? 
 It's not far. 
Bill, I did what you wanted. I got Tony out 
of there. Tell me what the hell is going on. 
When we get there, I'll tell you everything. 
Season 7 Episode 13 Mr. Burnett you are a traitor 
and a terrorist. 
Where's the target? 
Where's the target?! 
(loud bang) Take Mr. Bauer away. 
He's under arrest. 
Have you learned anything else about the attack? 
Renee Walker followed a lead on her own. 
Got a visual on a heavily armed commando unit lead by Juma himself. 
Bill Buchanan. 
Renee Walker says the target is the White House. 
BUCHANAN: Condition red. 
Secure the president. 
There's no safe path out. 
Weeed to secure her in the first floor lockdown. 
(gunfire) Hostage rescue teams are moving into place. 
They'll be prepared to storm the building as soon as the order's given. 
Mr. Vice President, 
terrorists are in control of the White House. 
HAYWORTH: Until you can provide me more intel on what's going on in there, you are instructed to refrain from launching any action. 
President Taylor is locked in the safe room. 
What is it I can do for you? 
I need you to find me another way in. 
Well, I'm looking at the White House manifest, and according to this, Olivia Taylor is presently in the building with you. 
You find Olivia Taylor, and you'll get the president to open that door. 
JUMA: President Taylor... 
(softly): God, no. 
...if you don't open the door, 
I'm going to cut out your daughter's eyes one by one. 
Open the door. 
Madam President... 
No, open the door. 
Open the door! 
I can't do that. 
I can't! 
TAYLOR: Do you have children, Jack? 
I have a daughter. 
Could you do what you're asking me to do? 
Just stand by and watch her butchered? 
No, ma'am, but I am not the President of the United States. 
Well, I am the president, and I am ordering you to open that door. 
All right, General, you've got me now. 
There's no reason to hold anyone else. 
Let them go. 
Now, what we do know is that the president was in the building when the attack took place, and she may have been taken hostage along with numerous other White House personnel. 
Vice President Hayworth was not in the building, and we're told he was moved to a secure location. 
The FBI has cordoned off a nine-block perimeter... 
Mr. Vice President, 
that was Agent Moss. 
What does he have to say? 
He's still requesting that you authorize a rescue operation. 
Does he have any more intel about what the hell's going on in there? 
No, sir. He deployed two units 
with deep-band parabolics, but all they were able to get what static. 
They think Juma's using some kind of jamming equipment. 
They've also got spotters at every possible angle around the building, but they haven't been able to see inside. 
we still don't know whether Juma has the president, or whether the president is locked inside the safe room? 
No, sir, we don't. 
(sighs) I will not authorize any action until I know the status of the president. 
Relay that to Agent Moss. 
Yes, sir. 
(Livia sobbing) Mom, I know that I hurt you. 
I'm so sorry for cutting you out of my life. 
It's okay... 
No, it isn't. 
You were right to fire me off the campaign. 
I felt so betrayed, I turned my back on you. 
Olivia, don't worry about it. 
It all seems so stupid now. 
I hope you can forgive me. 
Darling, I forgave you a long time ago. 
Livy, you have to listen to me. 
We really are going to be okay. 
Just keep your eyes open and be ready. 
Abo. 
No, no. 
Get up. 
Leave her alone! 
Get away from her! 
Get back! 
OLIVIA: I said leave her alone! Please! 
TAYLOR: Olivia, it's okay, darling. It's okay! 
Bill, we need to me to try to save the president. 
How? 
In the lockdown room, there were five canisters of CH-4. 
Before we surrendered ourselves over to Juma, I opened the valves. 
Within the next few minutes, that room is going to be saturated with natural gas. 
It's going to take one spark to set it off. 
I think the explosion is going to be large enough to take out most of Juma's men. 
That's when you can make your move How do we set it off? 
I'll me a run for the lockdown room. 
Try and draw their fire. 
All we need is one stray bullet. 
That's a suicide play, Jack. 
We don't have a choice. 
Just make sure you can get to the president and get her out of here. 
She knows about the plan; she'll be ready. 
What are you planning? 
Are you going to do something? 
When it happens, you'll know about it, Senator. 
Damn it, if you're planning something, I want to know what it is. 
Senator, shut up. 
JUMA: Read this statement. 
It is a confession of your crimes against my country. 
The atrocities that you have committed will now be seen by the whole world. 
I'll read your statement, General, but I need you to release the other hostages. 
You got what you came for. 
You have the President of the United States. 
As a sign of good faith... 
I will release one of the hostages. 
You... 
Stand up. 
(hostages screaming) Do you want me to release any more hostages, President Taylor? 
You son of a bitch. 
You will read this statement or I will do the same thing to everyone here... 
starting with your daughter. 
General, the uplink is complete. 
All right. 
JUMA: The world is waiting, Madam President. 
"This is the president of the United States." 
"Six hours ago, I ordered our armed forces" "to invade Sangala without warning and without provocation." 
"This attack was a criminal act motivated solely" "by America's desire" "to exert its power and influence." 
Tell me you're shutting this down. 
We can't, sir. 
It's a live feed straight to the Internet. 
I don't care. 
Shut it down. 
It's going out on multiple servers, sir. 
It would take hours just to trace them. 
(phone ringing) This is Derek Watts. 
Hold on. 
Sir, it's agent Moss on teleconference. 
Put him on. 
Sir, are you getting this? 
Yes. So is the rest 
of the damn world. 
Mr. Vice President, 
I believe Juma came here to humiliate the president and stage a public execution. 
We have a rescue operation in place. 
All we need is your authorization. 
You don't know what Juma's intentions are. 
This could be a prelude to a set of demands. 
There are no demands here, sir. 
This is about revenge. 
Juma knows he'll never get out of the White House alive. 
You're speculating, Agent Moss. 
My advisorare telling me the most prudent course of action is to try to initiate communication with Juma. 
We've been trying to do that. 
He hasn't responded. 
Sir, Juma has no desire to negotiate anything. 
Hes going to kill the president. 
Sir, we have a tactical plan in place. 
It's a two-pronged assault, and we're confident that it stands a good chance of catching Juma off guard, but we're losing time. 
We have to initiate now. 
I can not authorize any action at might result in the president's death. 
Keep trying to open dialogue with Juma. 
Hold your position till you're told otherwise. 
I will keep this feed open. 
TAYLOR: "General Juma has demonstrated" "that even a tyrant state like the U.S..." 
Be ready. 
Jack, listen to me. 
Juma's not solely coordinating this attack. 
What do you mean? 
I heard him talking on his sat phone. 
He's coordinating with someone on the outside. 
They were giving him real-time intel. 
You think it's someone in the White House? 
I don't know. 
But even if we take Juma down, the president may still be in danger. 
You're the only one I know who can do this, Jack. 
Find out who Juma's working with. 
(loud explosion) (panicked screams) Agent Moss, a device has been detonated in the West Wing. 
Mr. Vice President, there's been 
an explosion at the White House. 
An explosion? 
Yes, sir. 
The president's Internet feed has gone dark. 
We saw that. What's happening? 
I don't know, sir, but we're going in under my authority. Let's go. 
That is not your decision. 
All teams, Attack Plan Delta. 
Agent Moss, you're under orders! 
Agent Moss! 
Code Green. 
Go, go, go, go! 
(automatic gunfire) (gunfire) Pierce, get to the president! 
Madam President, are you okay? 
Mm-hmm. 
We need  get out of here right now. 
Both of you, come with me. 
Let's go. This way. 
(Olivia whimpering) (gasping) Madam President, get down. 
Stay low till I know we're clear. 
Ngozi... 
kill the hostages. 
The president is mine! 
Udo... 
Udo? 
No, no, no, no! 
Don't move! 
Don't you move! 
(gunfire) Clear. 
We're clear! 
PIERCE: Secret Service! 
I have the president! 
Aaron Pierce, Secret Service. 
Let's go, ma'am. 
(whimpering) Madam President, this way! 
We have the president. 
The president is secure! 
Repeat: We have the president. 
This way, ma'am. 
Renee! We gotta get 
the president out of here now! 
This way, ma'am. 
It's all right, darling. 
It's gonna be all right. 
Move! Move! Move! 
This way. This way. 
Madam President... 
we're still sweeping the West Wing. 
but we do believe all the hostiles have been accounted for. 
Now you and your daughter will stay here until we finish securing the building. 
TAYLOR: I understand. 
Now once we get the all clear, we're going to move you to Andrews Air Force Base. 
No, I'm staying right here. 
Ma'am, it's for your own safety. 
TAYLOR: Do what's necessary to make sure this building is safe because I'm not going anywhere. 
The American people need to know that the president is in the White House. 
Yes, Madam President. 
How many people did we lose? 
It's too early to tell. 
Medical teams are on their way to treat the wounded. 
We're going to set up a triage unit in the East Wing. 
All right. 
I'd like to speak to the vice president as soon as possible. 
Yes, ma'am. 
And I need to know how my husband's doing. 
Would you please contact Dr. Lee Schulman 
at West Arlington Hospital? 
Yes, Madam President. 
Thank you. 
How's Agent Pierce? 
They said he's gonna be okay. 
What about you? 
I'm not sure. 
I still can't believe this happened. 
I thought they were gonna kill all of us. 
I was so scared. 
It's over... 
and we're safe... 
thanks to a lot of brave people. 
Excuse me, Madam President, the vice president is on a secure line. 
I'll be right there. 
Did you mean what you said about putting the past behind us? 
Of course I meant it. 
I don't ever want to lose you again. 
You won't. 
(indistinct conversations) The president's safe, Jack. 
She's in the residence. 
She's secure. 
I'm so sorry, Jack. 
I know that he was your friend. 
It was supposed to be me. 
I was supposed to set off the explosion so that he could secure the president. 
He died protecting his country. 
Yeah. 
This isn't over yet. 
Agent Moss... 
Juma and his men were not working alone. 
What are you talking about? 
When I was in the lockdown with the president, Bill said he heard Juma talking on a sat phone. 
Said he was getting real-time intel from someone on the ouide. 
Who? 
I don't know. 
The point is, I don't think this threat is over, and I don't think the president is safe. 
You sure Buchanan heard this right? 
He wouldn't told me unless he was sure  And right now the only lead we've got is Ryan Burnett He knew about the attack on the White House, and chances are, he's gonna know who Juma was talking to. 
All right, all right, I'll talk to him. 
No, the president already offered him immunity. 
He turned it down. 
He's not gonna tell you anything, but he will talk to me. 
Why is that, Jack, 'cause you tortured him? 
I don't need to touch him. 
I just need him to think I'm there to finish what I started. 
And I promise you he will tell us everything we need to know. 
Larry, please, the last thing Bill asked for before he died was for me to follow this through. I owe him that. 
Look, I give you my word. 
I will not touch Burnett. 
Jack, look, I understand about your friend, I do, but I got standing orders from the president to take you into custody. 
I gotta get you back to FBI, but I promise you I'll look into this, all right? 
Agent Powell, handcuff Mr. Bauer. 
Take him down to Staging Area B. 
Sir, put your hands on top of your head. 
Larry... 
If you're gonna tell me he's right about this I don't want to hear it. 
Yes, that's the problem. 
You're not listening to what he's saying. 
When are you gonna stop defending this guy? 
I'm not defending him, I'm defending a good idea. 
I just said I will look into this! 
Now do your job: finish locking down the building. 
Agent Reynolds. 
I need to speak with the president. It's urgent. 
She's in a secure location. 
You'll need to go through Ethan Kanin. 
Where is he? 
He just arrived. 
He's on his way to see the president. 
Thanks. 
The president's in the residence with her daughter. 
They've both been checked over and they're in good condition. 
Thank God. 
I want a conference with the SECNAV and the Joint Chiefs as soon as possible. 
We're routing all White House communications to the residence, and we're setting up a temporary command post. 
Good. 
Mr. Kanin, 
I need to speak with you. 
I'm on my way to see the president. 
Yes, I know, sir, but it's extremely urgent. 
It'll only take a few moments. 
(sighs) All right. 
What is it, Agent Walker? 
Some new intel has just come to our attention and we need to act on it immediately. 
I tried to reach the president, but I couldn't get through. 
I'm listening. 
Sir, the threat to the president may not be over. 
We've reason to believe that General Juma was not acting alone. 
Before Bill Buchanan died, he saw General Juma communicating with someone on a sat phone. 
NEWSMAN: At this point, we can confirm that FBI agencies entered the White House moments ago, and there were reports of sustained gunfire. 
It appears that authorities are now in control of the West Wing, and we are expecting word from our FBI source of the status of the hostages. 
While there has been no official comment... 
So what have we got? 
The president's alive. 
Are you sure? 
We've been monitoring interagency servers. 
Word just went out. 
Juma's dead, Taylor survived. 
What happened do you think? 
We don't know any details yet, but we'll keep monitorg. 
(sighs) Well... you gotta admire 
the damn bitch. 
She doesn't give up easily. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
We, uh, just didn't have enough control over the situation. 
Greg, you look tense. 
Do me a favor. 
Have a drink, relax. 
NEWSMAN: Our FBI source speculated that thereere as many as 20 terrorists, all heavily armed... 
Juma held up his part of the bargain. 
We're getting what we wanted. 
As far as I'm concerned, everything's still on track. 
NEWSWOMAN: The shocking events of this day... 
Where are the weapons now? 
A shipment should ready for pickup in the next couple of hours. 
Good. 
Get Chapman on the phone. 
I want to nail down some targets. 
Sir, the chopper you requested is on its way. 
It'll be here in ten minutes. 
You'll be escorting Mr. Bauer  
back to FBI. 
Hold him in the command center. 
Yes, sir. 
(phone rings) This is Larry Moss. 
This is Ethan Kanin. 
I understand you're taking Jack Bauer back to FBI? 
Yes, sir. 
He's gonna be debriefed and remanded into federal custody. 
I want you to put that on hold. 
Sir? 
I just spoke with Agent Walker. 
She told me Juma may have been working with someone on the outside, and that there may be an ongoing threat to the president. 
Yes, that's true. 
I want you to send Jack Bauer to question Ryan Burnett. 
Agent Moss? 
Sir, I think that's a mistake. 
Yes, Agent Walker shared your concerns with me, and I've given this some thought. 
If Burnett does know who Juma was working with, Bauer's approach may be our best chance to get that information. 
With respect, sir, Bauer almost killed this man. 
I was there, Agent Moss, but this will be a controlled interrogation. 
We're gonna play on Burnett's fears. 
Bauer's presence alone should be enough to intimidate him into talking. 
Sir, Bauer is a wild card. 
We have no idea what he'll do when he gets in that room with Burnett. 
I realize there's a risk. 
That's why you're going to do this under my authority and my authority alone. 
You're not taking this to the president? 
No. If something 
does go wrong, I want to make sure the president is protected. 
With respect, sir, I think you're not telling the president 'cause you know she'd never allow this. 
You've made your objections clear, Agent Moss. 
I'm not going to debate this with you. 
I want you to take Bauer to question Burnett. 
That's a direct order. 
Do you understand? 
I understand. 
And I'm counting on you to supervise every second of that interrogation. 
I'll expect a full report as soon as you're done. 
Yes, sir. 
I want to speak personally to the families of everyone we lost tonight, so... 
keep me informed as they're notified. 
Absolutely, Madam President. 
And the minute Angela Nelson gets here, send her straight up to me. 
We need to start working on the speech to the country. 
Of course, Madam President. 
Patrick, you have just been through a terrible ordeal. 
Are you sure you're okay? 
I'll be fine. 
It helps to focus on work. 
I understand. 
(knocking on door) Thank you, Patrick. 
(both sighing) Thank God you're all right. 
How you feeling? 
(sighs) Like I just woke up from a nightmare. 
It was unbelievable, Ethan. 
I can't even imagine it. 
How's Olivia? 
She's shaken up, but she's going to be okay. 
I'm glad to hear it. 
We lost some good people tonight, Ethan. 
We're going to need all the help we can get. 
I'm thinking about bringing Olivia on as a special advisor. 
Madam President, I can understand your not wanting to be separated from your daughter after what's happened. 
Especially after what's happened, we need people who can do the job. 
I'm not disputing Olivia's competence, we need people but she's also a political liability. 
Nobody's forgotten what she did during the campaign, leaking damaging personal information about your opponent to the press. 
Olivia knows what she did was wrong. 
She almost cost you the election. 
She's changed. 
We talked about it, Ethan, and she is accepting full responsibility. 
She has learned from her mistakes. 
I'm willing to put the past behind us so we can move ahead. 
I still think it's a mistake. 
I don't care what you think! 
I am so sorry, Ethan. 
You know I don't mean that. 
But I've made up my mind. 
I want Olivia to join my administration. 
And I want it to come from you. 
Me? 
Your offering her this position would be a good way to extend an olive branch. 
I need the two of you to make peace. 
All right, Madam President. 
I'll talk to her. 
Thank you, Ethan. 
I understand Agent Walker was trying to reach me. 
That's right, but I spoke to her. 
What did she want? 
Just some procedural matters, Madam President. 
I took care of it. 
Larry, you wanted to see me? 
I just got off the phone with Ethan Kanin. 
Look, I didn't want to go behind your back, but you didn't leave me any choice. 
I didn't leave you a...? 
How about you choose to follow orders? 
I'm sorry, Larry. 
No. I don't think you are. 
Larry, I've seen Jack do some terrible things today. 
Things that I still can't justify. 
But he has been right every time. 
And you know what? 
I can't help but think that maybe if we had just stayed out of his way, none of this would have happened. 
Look, I am sorry that I went behind your back, but I... I promise you 
this play with Burnett will go down just the way Jack says. 
If you think you're going with Bauer, you are out of your mind. 
You may have gotten a White House order, but I'm still running this operation. 
I'll take Bauer to see Barnett. 
You're going back to FBI. 
I want you to clean out your office and hand in your badge. 
I'm suspending you indefinitely. 
Okay. I know that you're upset 
Larry, but this isn't over. 
You're going to need me. 
What I need are people that I can trust. 
I thought that was you. 
Look, you may think you got what you wanted, getting Renee to go behind my back, but Ethan Kanin ordered me to let you question Burnett. 
I'm going to be watching you every second you're in there. 
You do one thing I don't like, you're finished. 
You understand me? 
Understood. 
You should leave Renee out of this. 
She was just doing what she thought was right. 
Yeah? Well, 
she may lose her job over it. 
She's the best agent you've got. 
She circumvented my authority. 
I can't just ignore that. 
I've known this woman for nine years, and I've never seen her do the kind of things she's done in the last nine hours. 
We've narrowed the list down to 12 targets along the eastern seaboard. 
They're all within 300 kilometers of the base. 
How many people? 
10,000 to 15,000 in each target zone. 
And our kill ratio would be what? 
Well, we've chosen these areas for maximum population density, so the ratio could be as high as 80%. 
Let's hope we never have to find out. 
Get these coordinates down to the boys in Tac-Ops. 
Have them start programming them in. 
Yes, sir. 
We just intercepted a flash memo from the FBI. 
Jack Bauer is on his way to Kennedy Memorial Hospital to question Burnett. 
Bauer was arrested. 
How is this possible? 
There was an executive order from the White House giving Bauer access to Burnett. 
Bauer will finish what he started. 
Burnett will tell him everything. 
No, he won't, sir. 
I have already sent somebody to the hospital to deal with Burnett. 
He can take care of Bauer at the same time. 
Who did you send? 
Quinn. 
Oh. Quinn's good. 
Bauer's good, too. 
Agent Moss, we've locked down the entire floor. 
We equipped Burnett's room with two cameras and audio surveillance. 
Where is he? 
Down the hall. 
It's going to be a moment. 
Doctor has to revive him. 
Why? What happened? 
He was given a heavy sedative. 
He was in pretty bad shape when he got here. 
Dr. Wyndam, 
Special Agent Larry Moss, Jack Bauer. 
I understand you're here to interrogate my patient. 
That's right. 
Well, he's still recovering from his last interrogation, so if you're here to brutalize him again, I won't be party to it. 
Doctor, your patient was involved in a terrorist attack against the White House in an effort to kill the President of the United States, and I believe the people he's working with want to try it again, so if you've got a problem... 
We won't harm him, Doctor. 
This will be a controlled interrogation. Please, 
we need your cooperation. 
It's going to take him a couple of minutes to come out of it. 
Who are you? 
Shh. I'm a friend. 
What's your name? 
Robert. 
Robert? 
Yeah. 
You're recovering from heart surgery? 
Yeah. 
Do you have a wife, Robert? 
No. She passed away. 
Children? 
Grandchildren? 
No. 
What about this man? 
Does he have family? 
(chuckling): Yeah. 
Lots of grandkids. 
Make a hell of a noise when they visit. 
(mfled screaming) (muffled screaming) (muffled protests) (monitor beeping rapidly) (monitor beeping rapidly) (beeping) How's your arm? 
I should be back on my feet in a couple of hours. 
And you, ma'am? 
Oh, it's nothing a little aspirin won't take care of. 
I want to thank you for what you did. 
You took a bullet for me. 
You saved my life. 
There is no need to thank me, ma'am. 
Right, you were just doing your job. 
Only in this case, it wasn't really your job since you retired four years ago. 
Yes, ma'am, that's true. 
Do you mind if I ask you why? 
Did it have to do with Martha Logan? 
Martha and I were... close. 
It must have been hard for you what happened to her. 
I'd prefer not to talk about it. 
I'm sorry. 
You don't have to apologize. 
I hope you won't be a stranger, Agent Pierce. 
Thank you. 
And, uh... 
it's Aaron. 
Okay, Aaron. 
You get some rest. 
I'd like to head back to the residence now if that's okay? 
KANIN: Olivia... 
I was just coming to see you. 
I'm glad you're all right. 
Thank you. 
you have a moment to talk? 
Sure. 
(sighs) The blunt fact of the matter is... 
this administration has just suffered some terrible losses, and we need help. 
The president and I would like you to consider coming on board as special advisor to the president. 
I, uh... 
I have to say I'm a little surprised. 
Surprised? 
Oh, that you'd sign off on this. 
You mother said she's ready to put the past behind her... 
and so am I. 
I overstepped my bounds during the campaign and I was wrong. 
I'm glad you see it that way. 
But it's not the past that concerns me, Ethan. 
It's what's happening right now, and what's been happening ever since my mother took office. 
Excuse me? 
Do you think any of this would have happened if my mother had a chief advisor who knew what the hell was going on in her administration? 
What are you talking about? 
Her government was corrupted on every level, and it all happened right under your nose. 
Even you have to admit, it's an unconscionable failure on your part. 
Frankly, I'm surprised you haven't tendered your resignation. 
You have no right to speak to me that way. 
You don't know what you're talking about. 
You don't have the facts. 
I intend to get the facts. 
I'm going to find out exactly who failed my mother, and I am going to make sure that that person never is in a position to do it again. 
Excuse me. 
Okay, let's go. 
I'll be watching. 
You lay one finger on him, it's over. 
Right. 
He's coming around. 
Good. 
Wake up. 
Wake up. 
Remember me? 
Oh, my God. 
What the hell are you doing here? 
I've just come from the White House. 
Juma's attack failed. 
He's dead, and so are his men. 
A lot of innocent people died today. 
Good people. 
Including a friend of mine-- Bill Buchanan. 
You might have met him. 
You stay the hell away from me. 
And I want to talk to a lawyer right now. 
Do you hear me? 
I want to talk to a lawyer! 
Somebody get me the hell out of here! 
You're not going anywhere. 
It's just you and me, pal. 
Did you really think you were going to get away with it? 
Somebody please, help me! 
JACK: You're wasting your breath. 
They're not coming for you. 
Please don't hurt me. 
I'll tell you anything you want. 
Do you hear that I'm ready to talk. 
I'll tell you anything you want to know! 
Just get him out of here! 
I'm ready to talk! 
They're done talking to you. 
That's why they sent me. 
Please, you can't do this! 
You have no right! 
This isn't legal! 
(transmission static) What happened? 
I don't know. 
Looks like we lost the sound feed. 
Give me a second. 
There are no laws in here, Mr. Burnett. 
You aided and embedded terrorists, who then tried to kill the President of the United States. 
You have no right... 
Now you have to answer for that. 
The rules don't apply to you anymore. 
No, please, please, you can't let him touch me! 
Please, you can't let him do this...! 
Shut up! 
(static crackling) It could be a glitch in the trunk line. 
(metallic clatter) (shrill hissing) (yells and groans) (gasps) (Jack and Burnett gasping for air) (static crackling) (static cracklg) (breathing heavily) Damn it, fix the thing! 
I'm trying, sir. 
(flatline tone) (static crackling) (gasping) (coughs and gasping) Bauer? 
He jammed the electronic bolt. 
Is there another way in? 
No. 
Jack! Jack! 
Damn it, Bauer, open the door! 
(loud banging) (kicking door) Have security lock down the hospital. 
I want a high-priority APB issued for Jack Bauer. 
All agencies. 
(phone rings) It's done. 
Good. Thank you. 
It's done. 
Burnett's dead. 
And Bauer? 
They'll think, he killed Burnett. 
So, nobody will know that we we're involved. 
Good. 
Yeah. 
Now 're having some fun. 
(phone ringing) Agent Moss. 
Larry, it's Jack. 
Listen to me. 
Where are you? 
I didn't kill Burnett. 
I'm being set up. 
Set up? 
A man released some kind of nerve agent into the room. 
It immobilized me. 
He came through the ceiling and killed Burnett. 
I swear to you, I'm not lying. 
I watched him do it. 
Get back in here, we'll work this out. 
I can't, you know that. 
You can if you're innocent. 
Look, there is a reason why they wanted me framed and didn't kill me. 
They're trying to keep you distracted by dealing with me so they can finish what they started. 
Don't let them get away with this. 
This threat is not over. 
(sirens wailing) Jack... 
(sirens wailing) Jack?! 
Damn it! 
Tanner, Emerson spoke to his man inside the Bureau. 
 He says you're clear. 
 Good. 
I need to prep my men on the nextjob. 
Tell me what we need. 
I'll give you the specs when I get there. 
I'll engage him. Cover my flank. 
I can handle it. 
I don't understand. 
Almeida was orchestrating these attacks. 
If he doesn't have the C.I.P. Device, 
who does? 
Almeida's working for theJuma regime. 
 This is Colonel Ik� Dubaku. 
We demand an immediate withdrawal... 
of the U.S. Naval strike force 
by this time tomorrow. 
The American troops are still in position near our country. 
President Taylor just received your demands. 
Then perhaps it is time for a more forceful demonstration. 
 I know about Samantha Roth. 
 She's hiding something about my son's murder. 
 Roger wasn't murdered. 
 I wasn't completely honest with you. 
 What do you mean? 
 Roger didn't commit suicide, Mr. Taylor. 
He was murdered. 
Jack, Tony is not a terrorist. 
He's working with me. 
We're working outside the government. 
That's why we have to get Tony back undercover. 
Bauer, you're not gonna make it out of here. 
Shut up! I said shut up! 
Get down! 
We gotta get you out of here and back undercover. Go! 
 Tony, let's go! 
   The following takes place between 11:00 a.m. And 12:00 p.m. 
Renee. Security 
saw Bauer and Almeida... 
getting into a dark-colored panel van. 
 What direction were they heading? 
 West. 
What's happening with D.O.T. Cameras? 
I've been trying. 
Traffic images aren't loading. 
What do you mean, not loading? 
Just what I said. 
The server's not responding. 
 The hacker must be jamming the transmission. 
 How the hell can they do that? 
If I knew, I'd be able to get around it. 
Continue checking ancillary security cams A.T.M., parking garages. 
There has to be something. 
Well, keep canvassing the area. 
Someone else may have seen the vehicle. 
  That's what we're doing. 
 Fine. 
 Let me know. 
 No luck on municipal cameras. 
 Looks like they have someone running interference for them. 
 Damn it. 
Bauer must've worked out this escape with Almeida's people. 
I'm so sorry, Larry. 
That son of a bitch played me. 
Had me believing the Bureau was compromised... 
someone on the inside working against us. 
I realize now it was him all along. 
Don't... put this on yourself. 
 He played us both. 
 No. I should have seen it. 
This is fine. 
Take it downstairs, will you? 
Bauer's facing a federal indictment, years in prison... 
and Almeida must have offered him a way out. 
Agent Moss? 
The White House is on line one. 
Yeah, I'll take it in the conference room. 
Thanks, Erika. 
I'm gonna make this right, Larry. 
Whatever it takes, I will find Bauer and Almeida. 
Throw in the C.I.P. Device 
and maybe we'll be off the hook. 
Janis, what's the status of that shooter? 
He hasn't regained consciousness yet. 
But a print match is just coming up now. 
His name is Alan Tanner. 
He was former Special Forces, discharged after Desert Storm. 
 Discharged why? 
 Medical reasons. 
He made claims to having Gulf War Syndrome. 
Tried to sue the government. 
Case was dismissed. 
 I wanna be informed the minute he's awake. 
 Mmhmm. 
Sir, I'm connecting you now. 
Agent Moss, this is Ethan Kanin. 
I'm here with the president. 
What are you and your folks doing about this situation? 
We put out an all-agency alert. 
Everyone understands apprehending Almeida is our top priority. 
How did he escape? 
He had the help of a former C.T.U. Agent 
that we mistakenly trusted. 
 A man by the name ofJack Bauer. 
 Bauer? 
Thought he was in the middle of a Senate investigative hearing. 
Uh, yes, sir. That is correct. We issued 
a subpoena a few hours ago... 
excusing him from the hearings in order to enlist his help in apprehending Almeida. 
 Now you're saying that these two men are allied? 
 It would appear so. 
My God. You and your people have 
royally screwed up, Agent Moss. 
Without Almeida, we have no way of finding Dubaku... 
and no chance of recovering the C.I.P. Device. 
Ethan, let's stay on point. 
Agent Moss, are you working any other leads? 
Yes, Madam President- a confederate of Almeida's who was wounded earlier today. 
Uh, he's just out of surgery. We're waiting 
for him to regain consciousness. 
Do we have a time frame from the hospital on when that might happen? 
No, ma'am, not really. 
Let me be clear, Agent Moss. 
Recapturing Almeida and Bauer isn't just your top priority. 
 It's your only priority. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Keep us posted, Agent. 
  Bottom line, the Bureau is not going to be the answer to our prayers here. 
I'm afraid not. 
How much time does that leave us? 
Less than two hours. 
Dubaku's demand is that our forces retreat behind the 23rd meridian within 24 hours. 
Now, in order to meet that timetable... 
the fleet and carrier air wing must start withdrawing by 1:00 at the latest. 
Which would effectively end our mission in Africa... 
and condemn another 100,000 Sangalans to a certain and brutal death. 
On the other hand, if you authorize the invasion... 
Dubaku will undoubtedly engage the C.I.P. Device. 
How far has the F.A.A. Gotten 
with grounding aircraft? 
Still over a thousand planes in the air across the country, waiting for clearance to land. 
Dubaku could bring down any one of them at any moment... 
or use the device for something far worse. 
I ran for office on the principle of non-negotiation with terrorists. 
How can I abandon that now, the very first time I'm tested? 
And if I do so, won't I be telling Dubaku... 
and the rest of the world that blackmailing America works? 
Madam President, those are questions for the future. 
We have a decision to make now. 
What do you call this place? 
We like to think of it as C.T.U. 
What's left of it, anyway. 
 Jack. 
 Chloe. 
It's good to see you. 
It's good to see you too. 
I'm glad you're with us. 
I'm not with anyone until someone starts answering some questions. 
Might as well start with you. 
Why the hell are you not dead? 
I was dead, Jack. 
For almost 10 minutes, or so I was told. 
 By who? 
 By him. 
 His name's David Emerson. 
I don't know who he paid off at C.T. U... 
but it was his people who injected my body with a hypothermic compound... 
was able to revive me. 
 Who is he, and what does he want? 
 Independent contractor. 
Enlists ex-military and intelligence operatives, jobs 'em out to clients. 
 Apparently, I fit the profile. 
 What profile? 
Former employees with grievances against the federal government. 
Emerson had been keeping tabs on me ever since I left C.T.U. 
After Michelle was killed, he figured I'd make a good recruit. 
And everyone else thinking you're dead, so much the better. 
Yeah. 
And since then you've been working undercover to expose his operation? 
 No, Jack. 
 What? 
I was really working for him. 
I was angry. 
I hated the federal government for what it took from me. 
I ran Emerson's crew for more than three years... 
and I did some pretty bad things. 
What made you turn against him? 
The C.I.P. Device. 
Emerson had my crew stealing components to breach the firewall. 
I knew what that meant. 
 Innocent Americans would die, and I didn't sign up for that. 
 Damn it, Tony. 
 Why didn't you call the authorities? 
 He couldn't, Jack. 
 Why not? 
 He found out Emerson's client was Dubaku. 
That's who you believe has agents inside the government. 
TheJuma regime controls Sangala's vast diamond wealth. 
Dubaku hasn't been shy about throwing it around. 
 How widespread is the corruption? 
 Pervasive. 
That's why Tony came to me. He didn't know 
how far or high up this thing went. 
Dubaku's the key to this thing, Jack. 
If we're gonna uncover the conspiracy... 
we have to get to him before he leaves the U.S. 
That's why I have to get back under as soon as possible. 
There's a new job in the pipeline for me and my crew. I don't have all the details... 
but I do know that it'll get me in the same room with Dubaku himself. 
Challenge is going to be reinstalling Tony with Emerson. 
We have to assume Emerson knew Tony was in F.B.I. Custody and somehow managed to escape. 
 Emerson's gonna think Tony made a deal with the U.S. Attorney. 
 That's right. 
 I can help you with this. 
 Yes, you can. 
Outside of the three of you, who else is involved in this operation? 
It's just us. This is it. 
Please at least tell me that you've got some proof that this conspiracy exists. 
Yes, we do. 
But only at the lowest level. 
At this point, we've just begun to scratch the surface. 
Okay. I'll work with you. 
But only because right now, you are the only people that I trust. 
You give me one reason to question that, and I swear I will turn you in. 
You understand? 
All right. Chloe, 
set up the call with Emerson. 
I found two freelancers who might work- ex-Rangers. 
 Trust 'em? 
 Yeah. 
I've worked with them before. 
They're close. Litvak knows them too. 
 Okay. 
 They may want to know more about the job before they sign on. 
Only thing they need to know is what it pays. 
 All right. 
   Yeah? 
  It's me. 
Tony. 
 Where are you? 
 I'm at a parking garage, getting a car. 
 I got away from the F.B.I. 
 Yeah, I heard. 
I also heard it was Jack Bauer who broke you out. 
 That's right. 
 That doesn't make any sense, Tony. 
Bauer's working for them. 
He helped capture you. 
It's only because he didn't have a choice. 
He's on board now. 
What do you mean, on board? 
 You heard about the Senate hearings this morning? 
They're gonna file criminal charges against him. 
I told Bauer that if he helped us out with the mission... 
we could get him out of the country. 
Look, David. If it weren't forJack, 
I'd still be in custody. 
We can use him. I'm tellin' you. 
I don't know, Tony. 
Morgan's hiring new men now. 
Morgan's a thug! He can't run point 
on something this important. 
Let me do it like we planned. Bauer could take 
Tanner's place, and we're good to go. 
All right, bring Bauer. 
We're at 2211 Chesterfield. 
 It's right off Nolan. 
 Got it. 
 He buy it? 
 We'll see. 
Mr. Taylor. I understand 
you were looking for me. 
Yes, Agent Gedge. I have to go out, 
and I'm gonna need some transportation. 
 Certainly. Where will we be going? 
 I'll direct you on the way. 
Need a destination for the manifest, sir. 
As before, I'd like you to keep this off the manifest. 
And no driver this time. 
Just you and me. 
Thought we were through with all the subterfuge, Mr. Taylor. 
 Please, just do as I ask. 
 I'm sorry, sir. Not without an explanation. 
It's Samantha Roth. 
 She says she has new information regarding my son's death. 
 Mr. Taylor 
I thought I was done with this too. 
Believe me. 
I didn't initiate this. 
She called me. 
Brian, I know you felt obligated to report my... prior activities... 
and rightly so. 
But I would still like to think that I can count on your loyalty when I ask for it. 
Could lose my job, sir. 
This will be the last time. 
I promise. 
Henry? 
Please. 
 I'll call you as soon as I secure a vehicle. 
 Thank you. 
 Who was that? 
 Staff. Nothing. 
 Here. Can you help me with this? 
 Sure. 
 It was a gift from my father. You remember? 
 Mmhmm. 
The day I won back his seat in the Senate. 
Prime Minister Matobo has asked to see me. 
He's gonna want to know why I haven't authorized the invasion yet. 
 What are you gonna tell him? 
 I don't know. 
The American people elected you because they trust your judgment, Allison. 
And they're gonna trust you to make the right call on this too. 
I don't know what the right call is. 
The right call... 
is whatever you decide it is. 
 How many units in the field? 
 Seventeen. 
All available agents are deployed. 
Widen the grid. 
We have to assume Bauer and Almeida... 
have gotten outside of our perimeter by now. 
 On it. 
   Sean Hillinger. 
  Sean, it's me. 
Christina. Where are you? 
 I'm calling from the plane. 
 You haven't landed yet? 
No. The-The pilot says we're 
in a holding pattern, but but we just keep circling and circling. 
And I can see other planes out the window too eight or nine, at least. 
Christina, sweetheart. Relax. 
But- But the woman sitting next to me says... 
she-she heard something about a-a near miss... 
and a problem with the air traffic control system. 
Sean, do you know anything about this? 
Yeah, it's true. 
The F.A.A. Has grounded some planes. 
 But it's only a precaution. 
 Really? 
Yeah. It was an isolated incident. 
 You're gonna be fine. 
 Okay. 
I just- I got worried there for a minute. 
 You know how I am. 
 I do. 
Now, listen. I want you 
to call me as soon as you land. 
 I will. 
 I love you. 
I love you too. 
Was that your wife? 
Janis told me her plane's still in the air. 
 You okay? 
 Okay? 
There's a maniac out there with the capability of bringing down planes at will... 
so no, Erika, I'm not okay. 
Her flight is number 18 in the queue... 
so it'll be another two hours at least before hers gets clearance. 
I'm sorry. 
Is there anything I can do? 
No. No. 
There's nothing anybody can do. 
That's the problem. 
 Yes, she's right here. 
I'll let her know. Thank you. Bye-bye. 
Renee. I just got off the phone 
with the hospital. 
 Tanner's regained consciousness. 
 Is he well enough to talk? 
He's well enough to ask the doctor to make a phone call for him. 
 Who did he call? 
 Gage Whitney Pace, which is a law firm, I think. 
Second largest in D.C. Go grab your laptop, 
Janis. You're coming with me. 
 I am? Why? 
 Because we have to get to Tanner before his lawyers do. 
Because if I can get Almeida's location out of him... 
I want you on-site to vet the intelligence to our field teams. 
 Go. 
 Okay. 
Tell me about Emerson. 
He's British, former S.A.S. 
Urban warfare, sniping, close-quarter combat. 
Saw action in Beirut and Mogadishu. 
 So he's good. 
 Extremely. 
But he's not some wack job or ideologue. 
He's about two things money and personal loyalty. 
Sounds like you still admire him. 
Listen, Jack. He treated me like a brother 
when I thought I had nobody else. 
Is this gonna be a problem? 
No. 
I know he's on the wrong side of this. 
I'll do what has to be done. 
We're here. 
 Where's Emerson? 
 Inside. Come in. 
 David. 
 Good to see you. 
Take Mr. Bauer downstairs. 
I need to talk to Tony. 
 What's going on? 
 Bringing in Bauer is not worth the risk. 
What are you talking about? 
Have a seat. 
Mr. Emerson'll be right with you. 
I'd still be in F.B.I. Custody 
if it wasn't for him. 
 Tony, you already made your case. 
 We can use him. 
I considered it. 
But I'm going a different way. 
I owe him, David. 
You understand that? 
 Yeah, I appreciate your sense ofloyalty. I always have. 
But this is business, Tony. 
You can't have a- an unknown factor like Jack Bauer comin' in and messing things up. 
So what? 
You're gonna kill him? 
No, you are. 
 They're gonna kill him. 
 He'll get out of it. 
What if he can't? 
Then Jack's death solidifies Tony's position in the crew. 
Tony was in F.B.I. Custody. 
If he'd gone back in there by himself, suspicion would have rested on him alone. 
So by deflecting it ontoJack We keep Tony's cover viable. 
You knew this might happen the whole time. 
Yes. 
So did Jack. 
    Put your weapon down! 
Put your weapon down, or I will kill him! 
I came here to do a job, not be double-crossed by you! 
You're already short-handed. You need 
good men-not like these two traffic cops. 
Look what I've done to them! 
I am here because I've got nowhere else to go. 
Tony said if I helped you, you could get me out of the country. 
Look, if you don't believe me, pull the trigger. 
 What are you, crazy? Kill him. 
 No. 
Kill him or I'm out of here. 
Fine. 
    Keep it. 
Right. I need Flight 112 reassigned 
for immediate landing. 
So you're requesting a priority landing for Flight 112 out of Las Vegas? 
This is not a request. I'm forwarding 
an urgent protocol from the White House. 
And your name was? 
Larry Moss, Special Agent in Charge. 
This is a matter of national security. 
Agent Moss, may I have your Level Five access number? 
 6223510. 
 Thank you, sir. 
Flight 112 is moved to the head of the queue and should be on the ground shortly. 
 Thank you. 
  President Taylor, this is Colonel Ik� Dubaku. 
As you have no doubt confirmed... 
the near collision atJ.F.K. International was no accident. 
We have the C.I.P. Device. 
We have the capability to kill tens of thousands of Americans. 
 And we are prepared to do so. 
  I wanted you to hear it for yourself, Prime Minister... 
so that you would understand my dilemma. 
I see. 
You are recalling the invasion force. 
Well, that determination has yet to be made. 
And this device over which Dubaku has control... 
it poses a significant risk to your people? 
Yes. It's a technology that has 
the potential for mass civilian casualties. 
And it puts the infrastructure of my country in grave jeopardy. 
What of Sangala? 
Believe me. No one is more aware 
of what's at stake than I. 
So you've been informed of the situation in Kasanga Province? 
Juma's troops are advancing on a refugee camp. 
Over 2,000 lives are threatened. 
Mostly women and children. 
There's also the matter of those soldiers who have, on the promise of American support... 
deserted the regime and joined my freedom fighters on the ground. 
Please, provide us the weapons we need in order to defend ourselves. 
You've been patient with us before, Mr. Matobo. 
I can only ask that you be patient again. 
Now please, if you'll excuse me. 
Madam President, I implore you. 
 Do not abandon my country. 
 Mr. Matobo, I will do everything that I can. 
I count on you. Thank you. 
You didn't think that I would want to know about the refugees in Kasanga? 
Madam President, you have enough to think about without being burdened with details. 
Especially details that might push me toward proceeding with the invasion. 
Ma'am, you have to start focusing on alternatives to the invasion. 
Give me a good alternative and I'll consider it. 
I'm not saying it's a good alternative, but it's the only one. 
Comply with Dubaku's demands. 
Stand down the task force. 
 That's your recommendation back down? 
 It is. 
Damn it, Ethan. 
You heard Matobo. 
He has fighters on the ground counting on us. 
Do you want me to be responsible for another Bay of Pigs? 
Kennedy survived the Bay of Pigs, and you'll survive this. 
A superpower has to act first and foremost in its own best interests. 
 Always? 
 Always. No apologies. 
What about allowing a third party to dictate its foreign policy? 
Does a superpower do that? 
Yes, if there's no other option. 
And right now, there's not. 
What have we heard from the F.B.I. 
About the search for Almeida and Bauer? 
 Nothing, ma'am. 
 Check with them anyway. 
No hard feelings, Jack. 
Forget it. 
Have to be careful in our profession. 
I'm sure you understand. 
 Yeah. 
 We all know the drill. 
Disagreements are fine, but... 
when a decision's made, fall in or you're gone. 
I've heard a lot of guys say that. 
Good to know you mean it. 
Before you were subpoenaed, you traveled the world, place to place, for more than a year. 
Why? 
 What were you looking for? 
 Doesn't really matter. 
Whatever it was, I didn't find it. 
You must have known what was waiting. 
Why'd you come back? 
Wanted to know what it was like to walk into a propeller. 
That's funny. 
But no, really. 
Why? 
This is my home. 
That doesn't explain why you turned yourself in to theJustice Department. 
Tony said you were in Beirut and Mogadishu. 
And Afghanistan, two tours. 
Went back a third time as a private contractor. 
Be polite, professional... 
and have a plan to kill everyone you meet, right? 
Pretty much. 
That's the question, isn't it where do the rules of engagement end and the crimes begin? 
You wanna know why I came back. 
That's why. 
I'm not sure I follow. 
Just got tired of talking to myself. 
See, I actually believe everything I did was right. 
So I wanted to start a dialogue, come clean, set the record straight. 
 First mistake. 
 So I found out. 
No one who hasn't been to the edge and looked over could ever understand. 
 Yeah. 
   It's good to have you on board, Jack. 
  Yeah? 
Okay, let me check. 
What was that about? 
He's just trying to get a handle on me. 
Watch yourself around him, Jack, and do not underestimate him. 
I won't. 
Okay, I got it. 
 Yeah. All right, listen up. 
  Just got the call. We're a go. 
 For what? We don't even know 
what the hell thejob is. 
Picking up a package, delivering it to our client. Here's the location. 
A residence at 167 Foxhall Road? 
It belongs to the State Department. 
Memorize the layout. 
We don't know the exact spot of the pickup yet, but probably the master suite. 
 Package is a person. 
 Yeah, it is. 
Former Prime Minister Matobo of Sangala. 
Assignment is to grab him, deliver him to Colonel Dubaku. 
Colonel wants to ask him some questions. 
And, as you can imagine, the colonel can be quite persuasive. 
 Now, Matobo has tight security, so finish arming up. 
Be prepared to engage. 
 We'll roll in two minutes. 
 They're gonna kidnap Matobo. 
 We have to alert somebody and stop this. 
 No. We do nothing. 
But you heard them. They're gonna 
torture him and probably kill him. 
Unfortunately, yes. 
Matobo single-handedly led the fight against genocide in his country. 
 He doesn't deserve this. 
 I understand that, Chloe. 
But if we don't go along with the grab... 
Jack and Tony will not find Colonel Dubaku... 
and we will not get to the bottom of this conspiracy. 
Agreed? 
Agreed. 
 I don't want you to wait for me. 
 Sir? 
Just drive away. 
I'll call when I need you. 
You know I can't do that, Mr. Taylor. 
We're already off the manifest, Brian. 
She won't talk to me unless I'm alone. 
All right. I'll take up a position 
on the bridge. 
She'll never know I'm there. 
All right. 
 Mr. Taylor. 
 Sam. 
 I can't stay long. 
 What you told me on the phone Is it true? 
 Yes. They killed Roger and 
made it look like a suicide. 
 Who? Who did this? 
The same people who provided false documents to the S.E. C ... 
to show he'd been trading on inside information. 
 Who are they? 
 I don't know who they are. 
 They just said they would kill me if I said anything. 
 Easy, easy, Sam. Easy. 
 I loved him. 
 I know you did, Sam. 
But right now, I really need to know what happened. 
Roger was tasked with auditing the brokers in his department. That's how it started. 
 When was this? 
 January. Uh, earlyJanuary. 
The compliance officer at his firm asked him to flag any undisclosed ownership... 
 in securities positions. 
 I don't understand. 
Basically, kickbacks. But what he found 
was something else. 
Two of his portfolio managers had taken on a new client: The Bahamas branch of Switzerland's oldest bank, Bank Lausanne International. 
 What was wrong with that? 
 Bank Lausanne's records revealed... 
that it was actively trading with firms doing business in Sangala. 
 Sangala? 
 It jumped out at Roger too, for obvious reasons. 
And digging deeper, he uncovered other blind accounts that were copying the bank's trades. 
Which accounts? 
Accounts that were traced to a senior member of your wife's administration. 
 Who? 
 I don't know. 
But whoever it was had a vested interest in the proposed military action. 
Somebody who was betting against her... 
who didn't think she'd be able to pull it off politically? 
Betting heavily, in 10,000-share blocks. 
Roger was a day or two away from presenting her with the evidence. 
It's all here account numbers, trading records, everything that he knew. 
 I'm sorry that I can't help you out more. 
 Samantha. 
I've given you all I can. Do what you 
have to do, but leave me out of it, please. 
Okay. 
Thank you. 
Dr. A nderson, 2924. Dr. A nderson, 2924. 
 Tanner in there? 
 Yes. His condition is still listed as critical. 
 Are his lawyers here yet? 
 No. But they will be, any minute. 
Okay. Get down to the lobby 
and keep an eye out for them. 
 Call me as soon as they enter the hospital. 
 Got it. 
Portable X-ray to E.R. 
    Hello, Mr. Tanner. I'm Agent Walker. 
This is Agent Gold. 
We're with the F.B.I. 
I think you remember me. 
I know you're in pain, so I'll make this brief. 
Tell me where Tony Almeida is. 
Does Almeida have another base of operations? 
Is that where the C.I.P. Device is? 
 My lawyers  Cannot help you, Mr. Tanner. 
You're going to spend the rest of your life in prison if you don't cooperate. 
But if you do, I give you my word, I will personally vouch for you. 
Helping me find the device... 
 can go a long way towards reducing your sentence. 
  I'm sorry. 
Is something funny? 
They'd never let that happen. 
Who is they? Colonel Dubaku? Is that who 
Tony Almeida takes his orders from? 
Do you work for him too? 
Go away. 
Open your eyes, Mr. Tanner. 
I said open your eyes. 
Look at me! Is Dubaku here in this country? 
Does he have the device? 
Renee! Renee. 
Renee, please. 
Renee. 
 I don't know what you're doing. 
What are you doing? 
     Walker. 
 Tanner's lawyers just arrived. 
  All right. Thanks. 
His legal team is here. 
I need you to stall them. 
 Me? How am I supposed to do that? 
 I don't care. 
Make something up. 
Just keep them out as long as you can. 
 I'm not comfortable with this. 
 Comfortable with what? 
We are breaking about 50 federal guidelines just by being here. 
Listen to me, Janis. 
This man is our only lead. 
That man asked for legal counsel. 
I heard him. 
Thousands of lives are at stake here. 
We either bend the rules a little bit right now or we lose this chance forever. 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
I just- I can't. 
Look. Tony Almeida and Jack Bauer 
escaped custody on my watch. 
I have to make this right. 
Now you either help me or you don't. 
Okay. 
Excuse me, gentlemen. 
    You're out of time, Mr. Tanner. 
Tell me what you know. 
You can do what you want to me. 
I'm not gonna tell you a damn thing. 
   Who do you work for? 
You can't do this. 
Where is Almeida? How do I find 
the C.I.P. Device? Tell me now! 
My lawyers. 
You can't do this. 
You're F.B.I. 
This is illegal. I have rights. 
I suggest you use your last breath wisely. 
Go to hell. 
 (HDTV SUBTITLES FROM HERE)  added by w3sten I assure you, I'm taking this very seriously. 
Then tell us where our client is. 
As I said, he was moved for security reasons. 
Into the annex? Yes, sir. 
Then why isn't he there? 
Listen, if I can just get on the phone, I'll call my office. 
We'll get to the bottom of this... 
We've had enough of your help, agent Gold. 
I... I'm genuinely confused too. 
Excuse me. Uh-huh. 
We're trying to find our client, Mr Alan Tanner. 
Just a minute. 
I've got a ventilator malfunction. 
Damn it! He's coding! 
Get a team and a crash cart over here, stat! 
Room 421, tanner. 
It's blocked or something. 
We have to get in there! I'm trying to! 
It won't push. Hello?! Open this door! 
This is an emergency! 
I can't get the door open. It's jammed! 
Is somebody in there with him? 
He's all yours, counselor. 
Wait a minute. 
We need to talk to you! 
Renee... You don't want to know, janis. 
Don't ask. 
Have agent alves drive you back to the office. 
Hillinger. 
Let me speak to larry. 
Sir, I've got walker on the line. 
Did you get anything? 
I may have a lead on almeida. 
Apparently, there's a plot in place Against the former prime minister sangala. Matobo? 
Tanner says almeida's crew has a plan to abduct him. 
When Pretty much now. 
Listen, larry, if almeida's still a part of this And we can get there before him, we can set a trap. 
All right. I'll alert the prime minister's 
Security detail and scramble a tac team. 
Matobo's housed Is in the state department residence 167 Foxhall road. 
I'm on my way. 
Renee, do not go in alone. Wait for backup. 
Right. 
Yes. 
Is this major etolo? 
It is. 
This is special agent larry moss, fbi. 
This is not a drill. 
Alpha alpha delta. Lock the prime minister down. 
I repeat, lock him down. 
Yes, sir. 
We're clear. Go. 
Where's Matobo?! 
I don't know... 
Where is he?! Where is he?! 
I got him! 
Drop the weapon! Now! 
Put the gun down! 
On your knees! 
Where is Matobo? 
You will not be able to get to him now. 
What is happening, Ule? 
Who is doing this to us? 
Stay calm. 
It's going to be all right. 
It's dead. 
What you got? 
It's a safe room; reinforced concrete. 
Why the hell didn't we know about this? 
You have three seconds to open the door. 
One... I can't. 
Two... 
It can't be unlocked from the outside. 
It can only be opened from the inside. 
Jack, if we leave here without matobo, We lose our only chance of getting at Dubaku. 
You want me to blow up a couple of dozen FBI agents? 
You got a problem with that? 
Agent Walker, this is Jack. 
Get your men out of the building... It's a trap. 
You got the canister? 
Clearly, Hodges is behind this. 
I want him taken to the FBI for interrogation. 
He's a sociopath, mom. 
He's not going to talk... he's going to want 
To make some kind of deal in exchange for his cooperation. 
 Mom, you're not considering that.  Olivia... 
You know what this man is, what he did to Roger. 
I've upset the cart, have I? 
That bioweapon that you developed For us was not intended for personal use. 
I think we can both agree That there's no reason for your family To pay for your mistakes. 
This will induce a cardiac arrest And leave no trace in your system. 
We are rerouting to west arlington hospital. 
Have you heard from Almeida? 
I called him before I met with Hodges. 
Has he secured the canister? 
 Soon.  He's your guy. 
He better not screw this up. 
I have faith he'll come through. 
Why don't you go back to FBI medical and let them treat you? 
There is no treatment. 
There is no cure. 
Almost like they knew, Jack. 
They would have needed time To wire this building with explosives. 
This is the last sector we were due to search. 
Jack, what is it? 
What is your involvement? 
You're not thinking straight. 
The toxin's starting to affect your judgment. 
 Now, why don't you put the gun down.  Don't you move! 
I never wanted to hurt you, Jack. 
I told you to stay out of it. 
We get some help here? 
This man's having a seizure. 
The following takes place between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. 
Mr. Bauer, you should be feeling better already. 
I'm giving you five CC's of intravenous Pendopamine. 
It'll de-constrict your muscles. 
Just hang in there. 
Don't talk. Your vocal cords are in spasm. 
What the hell happened? 
Tony Almeida found him in full seizure. 
What about the medication pack you gave him? 
Wasn't carrying it. 
S-s-stop. 
Mr. Bauer,please don't speak. 
Stop... 
Tony... 
Tony? 
I don't understand. 
He's second man. 
 Jack, what...  Put out an APB. 
How do you know this? 
Do it! 
Attention, all patrols and perimeter teams, This is Alpha one. 
I'm issuing a priority APB on Tony Almeida. 
Approach with extreme caution. 
He's colluding with Galvez And should be considered hostile. 
All units who engage the suspect should do so with extreme caution. 
You really need to give yourself more time to recover. 
Here's another med pack. 
Make sure he doesn't lose it. 
I need to go tend to the other wounded. 
All right,tell me what the hell is going on. 
Tony was working with Galvez all along. 
He used us, all of us, so that he could get to the canister. 
So, wait, what are you saying, that... 
Tony killed larry? 
Yeah. 
They must have ambushed him as the chopper was setting down. 
Tony stayed behind so he could monitor our search, Set the trap and make sure Galvez could get beyond the perimeter. 
Oh, god. 
I'm so sorry. 
This is my fault. 
I vouched for him to you, to the president. 
I made a terrible, terrible mistake. 
I felt that something was wrong. 
Things weren't adding up. 
I just... 
I just wanted to believe him. 
Alpha one, this is agent Kilner. 
Alpha one... go ahead. 
Agent Walker, I'm at checkpoint Delta. 
I've got two agents dead, shot point-blank. 
Their vehicle is missing. 
Okay, he's made it past the perimeter. 
Tracking on the vehicle has been disabled. Position is unknown. 
Widen the perimeter, and keep looking for almeida. 
If we lose him, we lose the canister. 
You're not gonna find him... he's gone. 
We need to phone the president. 
Let's go. 
You made it. 
You sound surprised. 
After bauer called you out, I wasn't sure you would. 
You don't have to worry about Jack Bauer. 
He's not gonna be a problem. 
So, where is the canister? 
Where's the money? 
Hey, that was our agreement. 
Money first. 
There you go. 
It's all there, wired into your account. 
You can check it if you want. 
I want. 
Everything okay? 
Yeah. 
So, where is the canister? 
Right here. 
So, what are you planning on doing with it? 
Not really your business, is it? 
You gonna sell it? 
You don't want to do this. 
Hey, who's the damn buyer? 
Where's the canister? 
Where is the damn canister?! 
One of the marines that was guarding Hodges Noticed he was trying to swallow something. 
He intervened, got him to the hospital Before the poison could be completely ingested. 
So, he'll survive? 
Yes, ma'am, but the doctors are surprised he pulled through. 
That's because they never met the son of a bitch. 
How did Hodges get this poison? 
We suspect from a woman who claimed to be his attorney. 
Claimed to be? 
She was an impostor. 
DC police found the body of Hodges' real attorney About five minutes ago. 
We're still trying to determine How she managed to breach security. 
Madam president, agent Walker and Jack Bauer. 
 Put them through.  Yes,ma'am. 
This is president Taylor. 
I'm here with tim woods. 
Madam president... 
Have you secured the canister? 
I'm afraid not, ma'am. 
Our suspect escaped beyond the perimeter. 
I was told that the area was locked down. 
What happened? 
He had help, madam president. 
From Tony Almeida. 
Almeida? 
Yes, ma'am. 
He was working for us. 
It only appeared that way. 
Apparently, he was pursuing his own agenda, Trying to get his hands on the canister. 
Madam president, I know I vouched for him. 
All I can tell you right now Is that I was wrong and I'm sorry. 
Now that we know he has the canister, Do we have any idea what he intends to do with it? 
 No, not yet.  Or where he is? 
We're all hands on deck here, sir, regrouping to develop leads. 
I may have one. 
As Hodges was taken into custody, He yelled at me about some larger group That would continue on after his arrest. 
Something that I wouldn't be able to stop. 
What do you think he meant? 
Well, all I know for sure Is that someone doesn't want Hodges to talk. 
Shortly after he was arrested, Hodges was visited by a woman impersonating his lawyer. 
She apparently gave him some kind of lethal drug, Because ten minutes later, He tried to commit suicide. 
Tried to commit suicide? 
Oh, he's still alive. 
Jonas Hodges was completely unrepentant. 
Now, this suicide attempt must have been coerced. 
Well, obviously, they're holding something over him, Most likely his family. 
If that's the case, madam president, We need to talk to him. 
Jack, even after everything that's happened today, I will not allow any kind of coercive interrogation. 
Madam president, that won't be necessary. He'll talk. 
How can you be sure? 
Because we can offer Hodges something that he needs. 
And what's that? 
Proof of death. 
We can convince the people that wanted him dead that they succeeded. 
It's the only way Hodges can protect his family. 
Madam president, right now, He's the only lead we've got. 
I'll assume that was necessary. 
Don't start with me. 
I'm not in the mood. 
All right. 
Mr. Galvez decided to hide the canister from me, 
So, uh, I had to find out where it was. 
We've got a delivery to make. 
Shall we go? 
No, I don't think we should. 
They're expecting us. 
Yeah, well, the way I see it, They're gonna take this canister that I sweated blood for And sit on it for six months. 
Not sit on it. 
They're gonna use it to make more pathogen. 
We had 27 canisters; now we have one. 
Yeah, and I say one's enough. 
Look... 
The government's reeling. 
The FBI is stretched thin... 
Scrambling, making mistakes. 
Another attack today is all we need To push this thing right over the edge. 
This is no time to pull back. 
I say we take that canister, And finish the job off today. 
I don't disagree with you But it's not our decision to make. 
Fine. 
Then run it by your group or your gang or whatever the hell they are. 
But they'll know one thing. 
You finish your enemy off when he's down. 
You don't let him get back up and reload. 
I guarantee you,this thing's gonna be A hell of a lot harder To pull off six months from now. 
And you can say what you want about Jonas Hodges, The fact is, He gave us an opportunity today. 
Let's take it. 
I'll contact the group. 
Good. 
What did she say exactly? 
Only that she needs to see you And that it's urgent. 
I heard rumors about the fbi operation. 
I'm sure your mother will fill you in Olivia. 
Is it true the FBI perimeter was breached? 
I'm afraid so. 
The canister is now outside the cordon. 
What are we doing to get it back? 
Tim,would you excuse us for a moment? 
Of course. 
What is it? 
I need you to call the attorney general And draft a witness protection agreement for Jonas Hodges. 
Witness protection? 
You can't be serious. 
Less than an hour ago, Hodges tried to kill himself. 
And we all believe that he must've been coerced. 
By whom? 
You remember his rant... 
That he is a cog in a larger conspiracy, That there are others who will carry on. 
You think they're the ones who took the canister? 
Well,we need to find out. 
Which is why we need to get hodges to talk. 
Olivia,we feel confident that he will If we can assure him that these people will believe That his suicide attempt actually succeeded. 
We need to make him disappear. 
Which is why I need the protection agreement. 
There is no other way he'll talk. 
Designate him an enemy combatant, Then treat him like one. 
We don't do that. 
Not in this administration. 
And it's not as if he's getting a free pass. 
He'll be under federal supervision For the rest of his life. 
Oh,yeah, On a hundred acre ranch in colorado! 
This man murdered your son! 
My brother. 
Not to mention Hundreds of innocent civilians. 
I don't need you to tell me what he's done. 
Apparently you do. 
Olivia,stop it! 
What would dad say? 
I bet you're afraid to ask. 
I said stop! 
You think it doesn't tear me apart? 
I'm Roger's mother. 
But I am also the president of the united states And I placed my hand on a Bible And swore to protect and defend the constitution. 
You are my chief of staff. 
I need you to act like one. 
Now,Jonas Hodges Is at the FBI,and Jack Bauer will be there shortly. 
I need an agreement drafted. 
Do that please. 
The plan is straightforward... 
An attack today this morning During rush hour using the bioweapon That tony almeida retrieved from starkwood. 
You should have each received a data pack When you logged on to this call. 
Please open it now. 
The attack will be attributed to this man, Jibraan al-zarian. 
Whose body will be left at the scene. 
The evidence trail implicating him Will include fabricated e-mails, Phone records, And a large wire transfer to his account Via our favorite yemini bank. 
I'm looking at the briefing materials And I'm not seeing how this man is actually connected To any terrorist group. 
He isn't. 
As previously discussed, There are considerable tactical advantages To using an innocent. 
But what about his unpredictability? 
Al-zarian has no agenda of his own. 
He'll in fact be easier to control and manipulate Than a real terrorist. 
So what are The casualty estimates? 
Page three describes the casualties estimates As well as secondary effects. 
As you can see,we've listed Hold on Forget about What casualties may or may not be. 
We're talking about launching a new operation In the next few hours. 
Without any planning. 
And with only one canister. 
The plan for this operation was already in place. 
We'd just be accelerating the timetable. 
We were going to have six months to prepare. 
There's no way to pull it together in a few hours. 
I believe there is. 
With the support of this group. 
Support for whom? 
This tony almeida we barely know? 
And what about postattack plans? 
How's this group going to end up where we need to be? 
I agree. How we handle ourselves politically 
In the aftermath of this event Is just as important as the attack itself. 
It always has been in your opinion Is there time then to achieve All our objectives in the current scenario? 
Not with the same level of certainty. 
Or anonymity. 
That's right. 
Well,then,maybe it's,uh,definitive. 
What do you mean? 
There's no downside to waiting. 
There's a huge downside to going in unprepared. 
Things go wrong, We're looking at exposure for all of us No,no,I still don't see it that way. 
Gentlemen. 
Ladies. 
I've listened to your comments And there's wisdom in what I've heard. 
But there's also wisdom in something I haven't heard. 
Jonas hodges was a loose cannon, And the group is well rid of him. 
But,in his lunacy,he did us a favor. 
He did half our job for us. 
More than half. 
He pushed this country to the brink. 
You don't get many gifts like that. 
I say we take it. 
We have a quorum,I'd like to call for an immediate vote. 
Tony. 
How'd it go? 
Take a look. 
We're a go. 
 Where's Hodges now?  Down the hall. 
We've set up a medical suite in secure. 
And the death certificate? 
Done. 
As far as the world knows,he's molding on a slab  At the coroner's.  Keep it that way. 
No one knows he's alive unless they have to. 
No,just the ambulance driver, The medical team and three security. 
All trustworthy. 
Wait. 
Are you sure he's up for this? 
I know what happened out there. 
Medication worked. He'll be okay. 
I'm not talking about the seizure. 
I'm talking about the tony almeida situation. 
What about it? 
His former partner betrays him, He tries to have you all killed... 
Jack must have some feelings about that. 
Yeah. 
Yeah,I think it's what's keeping him going. 
Listen to me. 
Listen to me. 
Is anyone listening? 
I know you're watching. 
I see the cameras! 
I know you're watching. 
Do you realize what you people have done? 
You didn't save me, You killed my family! 
You killed my family! 
You killed them! 
Killed them. 
 How long has he been conscious?  Ten minutes. 
He's been talking about his family ever since. 
Biometrics are over here. 
Cardiac,respiratory,plus dermal infrared. 
Good. We'll know if he's lying. 
Jack, The president is monitoring this. 
Sergeant,I'm asking you, Soldier to soldier,let me have your firearm. 
I'll use one... one bullet on myself. 
Please. 
Relax,Mr. Hodges. 
You're already dead. 
Sergeant. 
Who are you? 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
And right now,I'm the only chance Your wife and children have to stay alive. 
Explain that to me. 
The people that wanted you dead don't know you survived. 
Tell us who they are, And we'll keep it that way. 
The president has agreed to provide you with a death Certificate and witness protection in exchange For actionable information. 
I can't watch this anymore. 
If you refuse,it'll be released To the press that you are alive and in our custody And that you're cooperating. 
We'll let your friends take care of the rest. 
My family is innocent. 
The president would never allow that to happen. 
She doesn't have the stomach for it. 
You might be right about that. 
But make no mistake about it,sir. 
I do. 
Trust me. 
Do your family a favor. 
Just tell me who you've been working with. 
I am... 
I was... 
Part of a larger group of like minds. 
You mean,other companies like starkwood. 
I mean people who can protect this country Better than any government ever could. 
There are hundreds of private military companies In this country,we're talking tens of thousands of people. 
But only a handful With the guts and the vision to do what was necessary. 
And what is that? 
The plan was to launch simultaneous attacks Early next year. 
Multiple cities. 
So the public would finally see That the government can't protect them. 
They'd demand drastic measures and we'd step in. 
How would you justify that to the American people? 
Simple. 
Offload the blame. 
We were going to supply the enemies That want to destroy this country. 
Muhammed this,achmed that. 
From sleeper cells the apologists say don't even exist. 
You of all people should understand. 
Understand what? 
I watched the senate hearing yesterday, And I was disgusted with how you were treated. 
You should be regarded as a hero, Not a criminal. 
I broke the law. 
You were following Your instinct to protect your country,just like me. 
Mr. Hodges,I need the names 
Of the people that you are working with. 
I have spent my entire life protecting this country From enemies large and small. 
I created Starkwood from the ground up. 
And the government used us to great effect. 
And now they think they can just throw us away. 
Are you telling me that this has been About protecting your contracts,about money? 
I tried to tell the politicians how vulnerable we are, And they wouldn't listen. 
So we decided to show them. 
By attacking your own country with a biological weapon? 
By killing innocent people? 
Yes,a few innocent lives would be lost, But only to save the greater number. 
Having the courage to make those hard choices Gives us a lot in common,Mr. Bauer. 
Let me explain something to you. 
You and I have absolutely nothing in common. 
All that you have done today is create a scenario By attacking your own country That has made you valuable again. 
Today has been nothing short Of a desperate grab for power, And it has failed. 
You have failed,and unless You want me to go public With the fact that you are still alive, You are gonna give me the names Of the people that you've been working with. 
 II don't have them.  I want the names. 
 I don't have any.  I want the names! 
I don't know any! 
Fine. 
Patch me through to Amy at the washington post. 
No. 
Amy,it's jack. I have a statement I need to make. 
Wait! 
 Wait! wait! wait! wait!  Give me the names! 
I swear... I swear I don't have them. 
This whole project was... was based on anonymity. 
We never met in person. 
Everything was handled through an intermediary,a woman. 
She never told me who she was. 
She never told me her name. 
I never asked her. 
The same woman that gave you the poison? 
Yes,yes. 
Amy,I'm sorry. something's come up. 
I've got to call you back. 
You tell yourself whatever you want. 
You are a traitor. 
Witness protection was your promise. 
Yeah. 
Madam president,did you hear everything That Hodges had to say? 
Yes. Is any of it even credible? 
All of it is. Biometric monitors here indicate 
That he was telling the truth. 
Whoever they are,this group just went Through an awful lot of trouble To get their hands on that last canister. 
It seems very clear to me that their plan is still on. 
 You mean another attack?  Yes,ma'am. 
I think you should proceed under the assumption That they might strike immediately. 
Hold on. 
Hodges said some time next year. 
No. Hodges said that was the plan. 
Given the chaos that he created today, The smart strategic move would be to act right now. 
Now,I believe the canister is still in this area, So we're gonna have to alert homeland, Have them start identifying and raiding targets. 
Hodges said that the plan was To enlist parties with terrorist ties. 
At this point,I think that might be our most solid lead. 
Madam president,I agree with agent Walker. 
We need to make an immediate threat assessment With focus on all known terrorist activity. 
The fastest way for us to get that information Is to gain access to the CTU servers That have been sealed as a result Of senator Mayer's investigation. 
I'll have them recommissioned immediately. 
And consider the resources of this government At your disposal,Jack. 
Thank you,ma'am. 
I need those servers right away. 
They're in doj evidence lockers on the third floor. 
I'll have I.T. break them out. 
Okay,good. 
We have a new shift of analysts coming in, If you can tell them what you're looking for. 
No,we don't have time. 
We need someone who already knows the protocols. 
I'll take care of it. 
Just get me those servers. 
Who is it? 
Hey,it's me Jack. 
Jack,where the hell are you? 
The FBI headquarters. 
I've been trying to reach you all night. 
No one will tell me anything. 
Is it true about Bill? 
Yeah,I'm afraid so. 
What happened? 
He was killed during the white house siege. 
Chloe,you should know, Bill sacrificed his life to save the president. 
Listen to me. This threat is not over. 
We believe that there's going to be a biological attack somewhere in the area. 
Soon. I need your help to stop it. 
How? 
I need you to reconstitute the CTU servers. 
They were seized when the CTU was decommissioned. 
I don't have access to them. 
You will by the time you get here. 
Who's doing this? 
We don't have all the players. 
I'll fill you in with as much as I know when you get here. 
I'm sending a car over to your hotel. 
Chloe? 
Send a car. 
Thank you. 
Morris,wake up. 
What? Are you speaking to me again now? 
I have to go. 
I need you to take Prescott and get out of the city. 
Why? I just spoke with Jack. 
There's going to be another attack. 
This time,it's biological. 
Okay,then we'll all get out of here together. 
I can't. FBI needs me. 
But the last time you worked for these people, They arrested you. 
I know. 
But I'm the only one that can get the servers back online. 
Well,I'm not gonna leave you here. 
Not with the possibility of a biological attack. 
Please. 
I'm the only one that can do this. 
And Jack needs me. 
And I just need for you and Prescott to be safe. 
Okay? 
I'll see you back at home. 
Just... be careful. 
I will. 
All right,before we begin,everyone make sure You have your updated briefing packets, And the latest CDC abstract. 
Jack,whenever you're ready. 
Thank you. 
I know many of you have lost friends and colleagues today. 
I have,too. 
Unfortunately,the time to mourn these brave men and women Is going to have to wait. 
'cause,as many of you are already aware, We are facing the threat of a terrorist event Somewhere on the eastern seaboard. 
We don't have specific intel As to the time table of this attack, But we do have reason to believe that The people that are behind this will want to strike immediately? 
Excuse me. 
Tim Moran,field ops. 
Who are the people behind this? 
Right now,we only have two confirmed suspects. 
Tony almeida And the woman he's been working with. 
We're still trying to identify her. 
The assumption is,the two of them are part of a broader Conspiracy as outlined in your briefing material. 
And the nature of the attack? 
All it says here is biological. 
The actual pathogen is a prion variant,designed to attack The central nervous system and ultimately destroy it. 
Do we know what the target is? 
No,not yet. We're also unclear 
On the specifics of the delivery device. 
Well,what leads do we have? 
Right now, We are solely working off an operational theory That the people that are behind this Will need to manufacture evidence In an effort to offload the blame for this attack To either another group or an individual With terrorist sympathies. 
During the ensuing panic, These people will move in and seize power Under the guise of creating and maintaining stability. 
So,our job here is to look for traces Of that manufactured evidence. 
How exactly? 
Pattern searches of suspicious financial transactions. 
Keyword intercepts of existing wiretaps, Websites and e-mails. 
And data-mining all NSA and CIA intelligence On jihadist activities over the past six months. 
Excuse me. 
Not only is that type of blanket surveillance illegal. 
We don't have the capacity to pull it off. 
The search algorithms  Simply don't exist. yes,they do. 
 At CTU.  Those servers were decommissioned. 
Not anymore. They're here. 
We're in the process of installing them now. 
Well,what does that make us,CTU-lite? 
Last I heard, The bureau was a federal entity bound by federal statute. 
Janis, do this or I will find someone else who will. 
I do not have time to argue. 
I'm not arguing. I'm asking. 
Moving on. 
I've got her from here. Thanks. 
Jack. Hey. 
Thanks for coming. 
You look like hell. 
 Are you all right?  I'm fine. 
You don't look fine. 
Maybe a little tired. 
Did you get the report I sent you? 
Yeah. I read it on the way over. 
 It's terrifying. How real is this?  Real. 
We're getting access to the CTU servers, right? 
Yeah. They're coming online now. 
Shouldn't I be supervising this? 
Yeah. Look, 
There's something I need to talk to you about before we get started. 
There's no easy way for me to say this. 
But tony's been responsible for these attacks. 
That's not possible. 
He was using you and Bill all along. 
He's really been working for a group of private military firms Trying to destabilize this country in an effort to seize power. 
So far today, His actions have cost the lives of hundreds of people. 
But he's threatening thousands more. 
It doesn't make any sense. 
I know he was devastated over michelle, but... 
Chloe, he's not your friend. 
The Tony that you knew... he doesn't exist anymore. 
There has to be a reason. 
A reason for what? 
Bringing down two passenger planes? 
Trying to ambush 25 federal agents? 
Chloe, he tried to kill me. 
He betrayed us all... you, me, 
And Bill, And right now our only responsibility Is to stop him. 
Now, I need to know that you can treat him As an enemy combatant, that you are with me on this. 
Okay, I'll do whatever you say. 
No, I need to know that you are with me on this. 
I'm with you. 
Okay. 
Let's go. 
His name is jibraan al-zarian. 
27 years old. 
He's a day laborer at cabrera granite construction. 
Immigration status? 
Illegal. 
His visa expired as of january. 
Ties to any extremist groups? 
No, none, but there's definitely anger there. 
Both parents were killed in a U.S. Air strike by the pakistani border. 
He was 11 at the time. 
Fits the psych profile. 
Bit of a loner, a mystery to his coworkers, And we build the rest. 
What about the family? 
One younger brother, who he's pretty much raised on his own. 
It's perfect, huh? 
Though it is doubtful that anyone sleeps very well in D.C. tonight, 
A certain calm was set over the streets. 
After an unprecedented series of terror attacks Left people all over the country shaken and demavery hungry. 
In her speech, president taylor went a long way... 
Morning. 
Pour yourself some orange juice. 
I'm not really very hungry. 
Sit down,eat some breakfast for once. 
It's unhealthy not to. 
What are you doing up anyway? 
I,uh, Couldn't sleep. 
Listen,uh,I want you to come home straight after the work today? 
Okay? 
No delaying. 
Why? 
Just in case. 
In case of what? 
These attacks,this terrorism... 
It's all over the news. 
Okay,it's not a good day to be a muslim. 
Jibraan,muslims had nothing to do with it. 
Doesn't matter. 
Nobody cares,believe me. 
Most of the guys at my work think I'm puerto rican anyway. 
It's about time. 
Come in. 
Excuse me,Ms. Taylor. 
What is it? 
The attorney general asked me to check in with you. 
He is waiting to sign off on a document I was told you were reviewing. 
Anyone happen to mention to you What this document is about? 
No,ma'am. 
No,I imagine they wouldn't. 
It's a secret,Highly classified. 
Not that I give a damn. 
It's a get-out- of-jail-free card For Jonas Hodges, The bastard responsible for my brother's death And so many others. 
I don't understand. 
Mr. Hodges died in the hospital. 
I wish that were the case,but no, And once the A.G. Signs this witness protection agreement, 
Hodges is going To live out his days in comfort and anonymity While my brother lies in his grave in arlington cemetery. 
Does that sound like justice to you,aaron? 
No,ma'am,it does not. 
And yet my mother saw fit To reward this monster for his cooperation. 
Well,I'm sure it was a difficult decision For the president to make. 
Not difficult enough. 
My mother may be able to live with it, But I'm not sure I can. 
Ms. Taylor,I have seen the guilty walk free many times. 
I understand your anger and frustration, And I am genuinely sorry. 
Tell the A.G. I've reviewed the agreement 
And we can move ahead. 
Thank you,ma'am. 
Is there anything else that I can do for you? 
Other than kill Jonas Hodges,no. 
I'm sorry,aaron. 
I didn't mean that. 
I was just venting. 
Ma'am. 
Hello? 
Martin? 
It's olivia taylor. 
Did I wake you? 
Well,as a matter of fact,yes. 
What time is it? 
Almost 4:00. 
Actually I didn't expect to catch you at home. 
I thought you were in Florida Doing opposition for the Gainor campaign. 
No,that didn't really work out. 
Why not? 
Let's just say that my methods were a little hardball For the governor's taste. 
So... what can I do for you,Olivia? 
You heard about the attack on the white house? 
Yeah,I watched your mother's address to the nation. 
Really impressive. 
She continues to surprise,doesn't she? 
Listen,martin,I need your help. 
Can we meet? 
 Now?  Yeah. 
Well,what's this about,Olivia? 
I can't talk about it over the phone. 
Well,it's the middle of the night,you know? 
Y-you got to do better than that. 
We were in a dive hotel bar in Atlanta Right after we picked Hayworth To be the running mate on the ticket. 
There was an issue regarding his abuse of a certain prescription drug And a local reporter who couldn't be persuaded to shut up about it. 
I remember you turned to me and said There was no problem That couldn't be handled or eliminated. 
Well,I was drunk. 
You were serious. 
You know,you're right. 
We shouldn't be talking about this over the phone. 
How soon can you be at the white house? 
How's 15 minutes sound? 
Good. 
You done with that yet? 
I'm not familiar with these commands. 
Oh,you don't want to boot the subnet with server two. 
It has a faulty bus that we weren't able to fix Before you guys impounded it. 
Well,maybe you'd like to take over. 
Only if you want it to work right. 
I don't like this either. 
 Is there a problem?  Yes,there is. 
I'm not comfortable doing this. 
I agreed to it,but I don't like it. 
What exactly aren't you comfortable with? 
Uh,well,the bill of rights being violated,for one, So if you're going to be doing anything Grossly illegal,please... 
We'll make sure we notify you So you can leave the building. 
Hello,big brother. 
Look,if you think your need To complain is more important than the lives of the people That are counting on us,go whine somewhere else! 
President David Palmer recommissioned these servers Because he felt it was vital to national security! 
President Palmer made the call! 
Is that going to be good enough for you?! 
Answer me! 
Yes. 
There's something really wrong with him. 
He said president Palmer. 
He meant taylor. 
He said it twice. 
What is this now? 
Probably a fuse. 
Here,you do what you can to finish up. 
I'm gonna go check the box. 
Jibraan! 
Hamid? 
Jibra... 
Hamid? 
Keep your mouth shut and no one gets hurt. 
 Who are you? What do you want?  Shut up! 
What did you do to my brother? 
 Hamid!  One more word, 
I put a bullet in your brain. 
Understand? 
 You understand?!  Yes!

24 Season07 Episode02 ********* We're done debating this, joe. 
The un's been issuing reprimands and economic sanctions while benjamin juma has slaughtered over 200,000 of his own people. 
That number will continue to grow if we don't stop him now. 
Did you find something? 
I did. It doesn't confirm how your 
son died, but it is suspicious. 
I'm listening. 
His girlfriend, samantha, received a large lump sum deposit about three days after roger's suicide. 
You mean his alleged suicide. 
I'll talk to her myself. 
Sorry for interrupting, senator. 
We have a subpoena for jack bauer. 
He's being questioned by the united states senate. 
We need mr. Bauer immediately. 
The cip firewall protects every major infrastructure system in this country. 
If it were breached they would all be vulnerable. 
The department of justice is about to file criminal charges against me. 
I'm not exactly in a position to help you. 
One of the men behind this threat is someone you know. 
You think tony's looking for justice by attacking this country? 
Help me find almeida, and you can ask him yourself. 
Where's tony almeida? 
I'm not talking to you. 
 This is your call. 
 Do whatever it takes. 
All right! All right! All 
right! I'll tell you what I know! 
Last time I saw almeida... 
there's nothing you or the fbi can do about this. 
Just stay away. 
Tony, just talk to me. tony! 
Gsa 117, this is northeast three. 
Go ahead, air traffic control. 
Advise passing 7,000. 
Should be a smoother ride for you down there. 
Roger that, northeast three. 
Gsa 117, enter descent for 1,500. 
I've lost comm with gsa 117. 
Call back fbi. 
Tell them we have a 767 on approach no longer under our control. 
*********** Anybody get through to global skies 117 yet? 
Not yet, sir. We're trying everything. 
Where's the plane? 
120 miles miles southwest of jfk. Right here. 
All right, we have to alert them somehow. 
Analyze the projected flight path. 
Figure out if there's any way we can contact them visually from the ground. 
Todd, access the passenger records. 
Get as many cell numbers as you can and try calling them. 
Yes, sir. 
Nothing on the emergency channels? 
They're not trying to contact anyone, but they just descended to 1,500. 
I don't know on whose directions. 
 Sir, I think I've got it. 
 Got what? 
Listen to this. This was recorded 
right after we lost comm with them. 
Gsa 117, this is northeast three. 
Go ahead, air traffic control. 
Advise passing 7,000. Maintain 1,500. 
Traffic ahead reporting minor turbulence. 
Should be a smoother ride for you down there. 
They think they're communicating with us. 
Bureau. 
This is air traffic control, northeast three. 
I need to talk to agent moss. It's urgent. 
I'll put you through. 
Agent moss, I'm transferring air traffic control again. 
What's your status, sid? 
Larry, the people that broke through the firewall are controlling one of my planes. 
They're talking directly to the pilot as if they're air traffic control. 
As long as the pilot thinks he's talking to one of us, he'll do whatever they tell him. 
My god... 
Gsa 117, this is northeast three control. 
go ahead, air traffic control. 
Standby for new runway assignment. 
Turn right, heading zero-six-zero. 
Intercept radar vectors for runway three-one-left. 
Northeast three, we're showing jfk weather systems unchanged. 
Yeah, we've had a change in wind direction. 
Locally, there's danger of wind shear. 
Roger that, northeast three. 
We're turning to heading zero-six-zero now. 
All right, they're changing course. 
I just got off the phone with sid paulson at northeast three air traffic control. 
Almeida's group is definitely in their system. 
Larry... nsa just detected it. 
They're trying to locate the point of entry, but they're not optimistic. 
Forget where they got into the system. 
How the hell do we get them out? 
They don't know. They've never 
seen anything like this before. 
I got the alley. 
Larry, go to channel two. 
Yeah, go ahead. 
I hope you got information from schector. This thing has escalated. 
"Escalated" how? 
Almeida's group has picked out a 767 in flight. They're controlling it. 
What? Why, to what end? 
I don't know, but we've got to find this guy. 
What did schector say? 
 Not much before he was killed. 
 What? 
Sniper across the street. We sealed off the 
building immediately; we know he's in there. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, it was surgical. 
I'm sending you swat teams to search the building. 
Thank you. Swat teams are on their way. 
I think you got a problem. 
Almeida called that office seconds after schector was killed. 
How do you think he knew I was there? 
I'm assuming he had him under watch. 
 I think it came from your office. 
 What? 
Someone from inside the fbi had to tip him off. 
They were the only people who knew I was going with you. 
No, I can't believe that. 
Yeah, and I didn't want to believe tony almeida was a terrorist, but at some point we have to deal with the facts, not what we want to believe is true. 
Look, jack, I read your file. 
I know you have a propensity for not trusting people, but my team has been working around the clock to find almeida; they are all good agents. 
Explain to me how they got a sniper on the roof that quickly. 
I told you, almeida had schector staked out. 
We were in schector's office for ten minutes. 
There is no way they got a shooter in position that fast. 
Now, until you know where the leak is, you have to assume that you've got a bad agent, and you need to work around him. 
No offense, jack, but I brought you here to help with schector, not to co-manage this operation. 
You brought me here to help you find almeida. 
And I am warning you, you better be careful who you let in. 
Mr.Bauer, I need you 
to surrender the gun. 
Agent kilner... jack bauer, put 
him in your vehicle till I get back. 
Yes, ma'am. This way, sir. 
What's your status? 
We secured the building; all exits are covered. 
When swat team gets here, we'll have video feed and we'll sweep the building room by room. 
 If the shooter's in there, we'll find him. 
 He's in there. 
Janis, whatever you've got on faa, leave it with to sean. Come here. 
 Wait a minute. I need her here. 
 So do I. 
There was sniper fire at schector's office. We've got three dead bodies. 
 Where renee was? 
 Yeah. 
 Is she okay? 
 She's fine. Listen, I need you to provide support. 
Renee thinks s has the sniper locked in the columbia building. 
 There are swat teams on the way; coordinate with them. 
 Okay. 
Anything else from nsa on how we get through to that plane? 
No, but we talked to one of the men who worked with latham, who said that based on the way the firewall was breeched, he doesn't think we can contact. 
 yeah? 
 Yeah, it's agent moss. 
Hey, got any help for us? 
Nsa's nowhere. What about you? 
We're trying to contact passengers. 
So far we haven't been able to get through tanyone. 
What about air force? 
They've scrambled an f-16 to intercept, but it's still about 13 minutes out. 
 Look, let me get back to you. 
 Yeah. 
Gus, have you been able to break into their channel yet? 
No, but I can hear almeida talking with the pilot. 
He's landing him on runway three-one-left. 
It can't be that simple. 
These people didn't take control of this plane just so they can land it on a different runway. 
Todd, what do you got on your radar that's on approach? 
Everything looks good. 
And gsa 117? 
Nothing near it. 
what the hell is this? 
What happened? 
All the scres for the eastern quadrant are locked. 
Try the backup systems. 
they're not working. 
 Todd! It's locked! 
 Mine, too. 
Okay, they're blind. 
All right... send their sunrise flight into 
an intersecting landing pattern with 117. 
Sri35, this is northeast three control. 
We have a new runway assignment for you. 
Set your vectors for final: Runway four-right. 
Roger that, northeast three. 
He's changing course. 
 paulson. 
 How do your screens look over there? 
 Who is this? 
 That doesn't matter. 
What matters is that I took out your control units. 
Call the bureau. Trace this call. 
 What the hell do you want? 
 Want you to see what we can do. 
Why don't you pull up the surveillance cameras at jfk tower. 
Give me the cameras at jfk. 
Sid, there's another plane landing on four-right. 
It crosses three-one-left. 
Oh, my god, they're on a collision course. 
Scramble emergency at jfk. 
Gsa 117, pull up. Safety alert, pull up. 
 Traffic on runway four-right. - Pull up. 
sir,we have screens and communication back. 
Phil... 
we're good. 
yeah. 
That was just a warning shot. 
Whatever we do next will not be a demonstration. 
It'll be the real thing. 
What do you people want? 
You'll find out soon enough. 
it's emerson. 
Emerson's here. 
Get the module ready. 
Uncuff him. 
What happened to those planes? 
Don't worry about that. 
Did you crash them? 
How many people did you kill? 
Get him cleaned up. 
Hey,tony. 
David. 
I take it everything went as planned. 
Yeah. The off-site testing 
the module worked perfectly. 
Let's see it good. 
That's our genius,huh? 
Yes,it is. 
Had to be encouraged? 
Yeah,but...I've got him to a place 
where he'll do whatever you want. 
Can I talk to you a second? 
Take the module. 
So,tell me how the fbi managed to find schector. 
They used an old colleague of mine. 
An agent I worked with at ctu named jack bauer. 
I know who bauer is. 
Yeah,well,he's not going to be a problem. 
I took care of schector before he could tell the fbi anything. 
I'll take care of jack bauer,too. 
I n't want you distracted from this new job. 
Speaking of which,you haven't told me what that is. 
Tanner has the specs. 
He'll brief you when he gets here. 
Why don't you just tell me now? 
'Cause you don't need to know yet. 
Tony,we've been doing this three years. 
The less information any one of us has,the safer we all are. 
Come on,after this next job,we're done. 
Cash in our chips,do whatever we want. 
All right. 
I'll call you when tanner gets here. 
Okay. 
Let's go. 
Come on,let's go. 
I'm about to make a statement,sir. 
Are there any changes I should know about? 
No,this is fine. 
Just remember,don't indicate when the go-ahead to invade will be given,no matter how hard they push. 
But it's acceptable to mention that the president is meeting with former prime minister matobo? 
Yes. 
And when they ask whether the president sees him as juma's successor? 
No need to hide that fact. 
President wants maximum exsure on her support for matobo. 
Thank you,sir. 
good morning,ladies and gentlemen. 
Despite obal condemnation and un-imposed economic sanctions, general benjamin juma has refused to stop the genocide that his brutal dictatorship has been perpetrating since he took power. 
President taylor has made a persuasive case to the world that a full-scale military intervention by us forces and a complete overthrow of the juma regime would be the only way to stop the continued slaughter of the innocent men,women and children of sangala. 
yes,you there. 
Angela,has the president formulated a timeframe for this intervention? 
Hello. 
Jfk? 
How long ago did this happen? 
I can tell you that president taylor and former prime minister ule matobo are meeting as we speak to formulate a post-invasion strategy. 
I know how hard you fought to get the support needed to launch this military operation. 
And I want you to know my country will be eternally grateful. 
Our soldiersre the ones truly deserving of your gratitude. 
They're the people putting their lives on the line. 
Still,I know you are taking a great political risk. 
I have no reservations. 
Stopping juma is the right thing to do. 
But once he's been removed from power,it is critical that he be dealt with in a court of law. 
And not in a way that would perpetuate the cycle of violence. 
Juma has killed over 200,000 of our people,including two of my own brothers. 
So no one knows more about the "cycle of violence" than I do. 
But my countrymen will want to see juma punished. 
Then punish him according to the rule of law. 
That's the only way democracy will work in sangala. 
If no one is treated outside the law. 
Not even juma. 
You have my word. 
And now,I'd like for us to go over some last-minute operational points with my secretary of defense. 
All right. 
Excuse me,mr.Matobo. 
What's the emergency,ethan? 
Northeast air traffic control just reported a near-miss between two commercial flights at jfk. 
Fortunately,no one was hurt. 
And we think this man almeida was behind it? 
It's him. 
We verified his voice print. 
He contacted air traffic control and told them this was a demonstration; a shot across the bow,so to speak. 
What does he want? 
His exact words were: "You'll find out soon enough." 
Oh,this is unacceptable. 
I mean,it's just technology. 
We should be able to unplug these bastards. 
Well,we're trying everything we can think of,but it's not that simple. 
What's being done to find almeida? 
The fbi believes they're closing in on one of his associates. 
What's their timeframe? 
That's unclear. 
Let's go ahead with grounding all nonessential air traffic,and set up a meeting with homeland,fbi,and dod. 
Yes,madam president. 
Yeah. 
Who is it? 
Hold on. 
Tanner. 
Hey,tanner,what's going on? 
I'm trapped in the columbia building. 
Fbi's sweeping it right now,floor by floor. 
I don't know how the hell I'll be able to get past them. 
I understand. Exactly where 
in the building are you? 
The basement. 
Near the west stairwell. 
We're on 12th. 
Roger that,alpha. 
M Sixth floor's clear. We're moving. 
Charlie two,moving to the fifth floor. 
Proceed. 
Mr.Bauer? 
Yeah? 
I just wanted to tell you what they're making you go through at that senate hearing,it's wrong. 
No,it's not. 
It's better that everything comes out in the open. 
We've done so many secret things over the years in the name of protecting this country we've created two worlds: Ours and the people we promised to protect. 
They deserve to know the truth. 
Then they can decide how far they want to let us go. 
Still,you don't deserve to be treated that way, not after what you've done for our country. 
And I'm not the only one who thinks so. 
Thank you. 
Entering the basement from the west stairwell. 
Roger that,agent lennert. 
I'm here to get you out. 
Tony sent me. 
How? 
Put this on. 
A swat unit just cleared the stairwell. 
Take it up to the lobby. 
There's a gray ford parked next to the kiosk in the lot behind the building. 
Go. 
This is lennert. 
Basement level is clear. 
Roger that. 
Alpha team is clearing the first floor.You can hook up with them. 
On my way. 
Agent walker,she's good,huh? 
Yes,sir. 
She understands what it takes to get the job done. 
You mind if I step out and get some air? 
It's been a hell of a morning. 
Yeah,sure thing. 
Just stay close,sir. 
Yeah.Thanks. 
Just got an update from headquarters. 
Your friend,tony almeida,just used the device to orchestrate a neariss between two planes. 
He's threatening to do it for real ne time. 
Are all your men represented on the deployment grid? 
Yeah.Why? 
I don't want you to do anything now,but see that man walking away? 
That's your shooter. 
How can that be possible? 
If one of your people helped him get through the perimeter.Check the grid. 
Look out. 
You're right.He's not one of ours. 
We'll follow him,see if he leads us back to almeida-- dornan. 
No,that's not the right move. 
You can't bring anyone else into this,not until you know how badly the bureau's been compromised. 
Okay,so what are you suggesting? 
We can do this on our own. 
Yes,agent walker? 
Ma'am? 
Put more agents on the eastern edge of the building.The perimeter looks light. 
On it. 
 You made the right call. 
 We'll see. 
I need your vehicle. 
We have some breaking news to tell you about right now. 
The faa nfirms a near-miss between two planes at jfk international airport just a short time ago. 
As a result,outgoing flights nationwide are now grounded. 
Planes already in the air will be grounded once they land. 
The faa... 
listen to me,latham. 
Do as you're told,you'll stay alive. 
You understand? 
Put him in storage.Watch him. 
an effective demonstration,wouldn't you say,mr.Dubaku? 
Very effective. 
General juma will be pleased. 
Is that the module?As promised. 
And I've brought the man who constructed it here in case there are any modifications necessary. 
Well,now that we've impressed upon the white house what we can do,mr.Dubaku, 
perhaps now would be a good time to make your demands known to president taylor. 
Make the preparations. 
Your government killed my other and they tried to kill me. 
Now they are going to pay a very steep price for... 
interfering in our affairs. 
Faa is landing flights,so far without incident, but these people have proven what they can do, and at any time,can sabotage air traffic or any of the infrastructure systems we have beyond the firewall. 
Does nsa have a timeframe on fixing it so we can keep these pele out permanently? 
Madame president,the cip firewall was the result of a multi-year project. 
Reengineering the code could take weeks or months. 
At this point,nsa just doesn't know. 
Exactly what systems are vulnerable,dr.Cornell? 
At the top of the list would be the national power grid. 
If disabled,we could end up being unable to deliver power to many millions of people. 
A blackout of that scale would almost certainly result in rioting in the major cities. 
Even more critical are the water treatment and distribution systems. 
By sabotaging key dams and sewage processing plants, they could contaminate drinking water on a massive scale. 
Deaths from poisoning would be substantial up front and massive casualties would follow soon thereafter as people began to die from dehydration. 
Is there any way to protect these systems? 
The only way would be shutting them down,and then,within a short time, it would be impossible to supply the population with sufficient food and clean water. 
The resulting civil unrest would undoubtedly aggravate the situation. 
Here are the latest projections. 
Thank you. 
Ethan kanin. 
Mr.Kanin,this is agent gedge. 
I'm with the first gentleman. 
With him where?What's he doing? 
Mr.Taylor is on his way to 
confront roger's former girlfriend. 
I thought he gave up on all of this. 
Sir,he's consumed by the idea that his son was murdered,and for the past two months, he's been pursuing that belief through a private detective he hired without the president's knowledge. 
My god. 
Why is this the first time I'm hearing anything about this? 
I take full responsibility for that,sir. 
Mr.Taylor enlisted me in keeping his 
activities off the official manifest, but,uh,it's gotten out of hand. 
And at this point,I'm worried about mr.Taylor'S... 
state of mind. 
I think the president needs to know what's going on. 
All right. 
Thank you,agent gedge. 
Agent gedge? 
 Sir? 
 Everything all right? 
Yes,sir.Just checking in. 
Building disaster preparedness scenarios is not enough. 
I want the governors to put the national guard on a pre-deployment footing. 
And until we find and stop the people behind this, I think we should talk about raising the alert level. 
Yes,sir,we have the building locked down,and we're searching for the suspect as we speak. 
It's our higst priority,sir. 
Understood,sir. 
The white house is all over this.Homeland's leaning on us. 
We have got to find this guy now. 
Dornan's team is almost done with their first sweep through the building, but he said it's his gut feeling that the sniper is not in there. 
I don't care about his gut feeling. 
Renee said they had that building locked down right after the shots were fired. 
 He's got to be in there. 
 Yes,sir. 
Tell them to search every square inch. 
what? 
Dornan also wants to know if we know where agent walker is. 
She's not at the scene? 
She left ten minutes ago without logging her destination. 
What about bauer? 
He left the scene with her. 
He's coming up on heavy traffic.You 
can drop back a little more. 
It's all right.I've got him. 
 it's larry. 
 Don't answer it. 
Then he'll get worried or suspicious. 
Dornan said you left the scene. 
Why?What's going on? 
Swat has the operation well in hand.I'm following up on a lead. 
What lead? 
A weapon we found at schector'S.There's 
a partial serial number. 
I want to run it past a source. 
 With bauer? 
 Uh,yes,he's accompanying me. 
Renee... 
what the hell's going on? 
What are you talking about? 
Getting our hands on that shooter is our best chance of finding almeida and finding that device. 
And I don't think you'd turn your back on that operation for a lead you could easily have passed off to another agent. 
 I'm not sure what you're getting at. 
 Neither am I. 
Has bauer gotten you involved with something? 
Larry,do you trust me? 
You know the answer to that. 
Then please just accept what I'm telling you. 
We're following up on a lead,and I will fill you in if and when we find something. 
all right. 
Damn it. 
I do not like this. 
 I just flat out lied to my boss. 
 Did he buy it? 
Are we in the clear? 
Yeah,I think so. 
Good.Thanks. 
is renee's comm unit active? 
Yeah.Her walkie's on. 
Can you do a triangulation on it? 
Well,that's not really what the system is set up for. 
But I can try. 
Do more than try.I want 
to know where she is. 
 Can you not just call her? 
 Janis... 
 just do it. 
 Okay. 
Back at schector's office,when I told you to get almeida's locatio out of him, how far were you planning to go with that? 
You told me to do whatever it takes. 
Yeah,I said that for schector's benefit,to scare him,but you were actually planning to do it. 
How far would you have gone? 
It doesn't matter now. 
It does to me. 
I just put my career on the line because of you,and I'd like to know who I'm dealing with. 
Yeah,well,you read my file. 
Your file doesn't tell me how you justify the thingshat you've done. 
You know,I've been answering a lot of questions lately about my past and,frankly,I'm done. 
I told you I'd help you find tony almeida. 
I even agreed to do it your way. 
Since the fbi's been compromised,that's no longer an option. 
Now,I can still help you find him,but you're going to have to let me do it my way. 
Is that going to be a problem? 
We'll see. 
I know you think this is a mistake. 
It's not my place to say that,sir. 
And if it was? 
The authorities have already questioned your son's girlfriend,sir. 
Not about this. 
They assumed my son killed himself and didn't look deeply enough into anything. 
This way,sir. 
Well,even though the market's been soft,you don't want to hedge your buy on this. 
It's really all I can do today. 
You know 10,000 shares isn't going to cut it. 
excuse me a moment. 
Samantha roth. 
Miss roth,there is a secret service agent here to see you. 
What? 
He's at reception. 
Would you like me to have someone show him to your desk? 
No. 
Um,I'll be right there. 
All right. 
let me call you back. 
Ma'am. 
Mr.Taylor? 
This is quite a surprise. 
How are you? 
I wanted to have a word with you,sam,in private. 
Of course. 
I'm-I'm really sorry we haven't spoken since roger's funeral. 
It's just...it's been so difficult for me. 
I know about the money,sam. 
Excuse me? 
$400,000 wired to an offshore account in the cayman islands three days after you found my son's body. 
There's no point in denying it. 
I just want to know who paid you and why. 
Paid me? 
You know something about my son's death, and somebody's paid you to keep quiet about it. 
Mr.Taylor,that is just not true. 
Please,just answer the question! 
The money... 
it... 
it isn't mine. 
What do you mean,it's not yours? 
It belongs to my aunt. 
She's had financial difficulties since my uncle passed away last year. 
It's from his divested real estate holdings. 
I suggested she move it to an offshore account to hide it from the irs. 
You want me to believe you had the presence of mind to commit tax fraud three days after my son died, the man you supposedly loved? 
I did love him. 
And I'm telling you the truth. 
You have to believe me. 
I don'T. 
You're lying. 
Well,if that's what you think then we have nothing left to talk about... 
you're not going anywhere till I get the truth. 
Let go of me. 
Sir! 
You know who murdered my son. 
No one murdered him. 
He killed himself. 
Mr.Taylor,we need to go. 
Right now. 
I'm going to find out what you're hiding, and when I do,god help you. 
tanner. 
I'm out. 
Copy that. 
Emerson spoke to his man inside the bureau. 
He says you're clear. 
Good. 
Look,I need to prep my men on the next job so why don't you tell me what we need. 
I'll give you the specs when I get there. 
Where are you? 
I'm just pulling in right now. 
We'll be standing by. 
When tanner gets here,we'll take off. 
Why don't you start the deletion program while we pack up? 
Damn it.We can't go any farther.He'll make us.Hold on. 
agent walker,we need to go! 
Here.You're going to need this. 
Thank you. 
I'll engage him.Cover my flank. 
I can handle it. 
Okay,let's go.Now. 
put the weapon down. 
Now! 
is tony almeida on the boat? 
Is tony almeida on the boat? 
I don't know. 
jack!It doesn't matter. 
Almeida's not the priority. 
The device is. 
We have to go in now. 
surveillance camera went out. 
Go check it out. 
cover me. 
Deletion Complete damn it! 
Tony! 
Stop! 
Damn it. 
the device is gone. 
The locator files have been deleted. 
Where is it? 
okay. 
What happened to you? 
What the hell happened to you? 
 No! 
 Sir, it's Senator Mayer. 
He's dead. 
Are you telling me thatJack Bauer just killed a United States senator? 
How could you have let this happen? 
Mr. Kanin, you are not gonna 
lay this one at my feet. 
What is it, Ethan? What's wrong? 
Madam President, I'm afraid I have no choice but to resign as your chief of staff You're taking this too far. 
Where's Jack? 
We don't have him. 
The man who framed Jack for Burnett's murder... 
was John Quinn, a Starkwood contractor. 
Jack went to Mayer to get the evidence to prove it. 
Starkwood was involved with everything that's happened today. 
They helped Juma and his men bring down those planes and attack the White House. 
In exchange, they were allowed to develop and manufacture a W.M.D. In Sangala. 
The text message I got off their agent's cell phone... 
said " Port of Alexandria, Lot C, 10:15 p.m." 
 Go red! Go red! 
 Engage. Engage! 
  Get that truck outta here, now! 
 Tony! The truck 
I'm going after it! Cover me now! 
I'm in possession of a biological weapon interdicted at the Port of Alexandria. 
What's your status? 
The package is secure. We're inbound. 
 What about Bauer? 
 He's at the scene, sir, but he sought cover nearby. 
We have to assume that he contacted the authorities... 
so we better be on an accelerated timetable. 
 Get over here. 
 Starkwood reacquired the bioweapon. 
They airlifted the freight right outta here. They 
were headed due west from my current position. 
Jack, I can't assault a private compound unless I have proof that a weapon exists. 
 Where's the C.D.C. 
 They're scrambling a team right now. 
Send 'em to me. 
You'll have all the proof you need. 
 Jack, what happened? 
 I was exposed. 
 The following takes place between 11:00 p.m. And 12:00 a.m. 
We're ready for, you, sir. 
Come with me. 
Mr. Bauer, Dr. Macer, C.D.C. 
We need you to get undressed. 
You're the one that talked to Agent Moss? 
He brought me up to speed. Said you had 
some information about the bioweapon. 
All I know is that it was developed in Sangala. 
According to rumors from the village that it was tested on... 
all the victims suffered from dementia and paralysis. 
Check neurological vectors and pathogens. 
How much was released? 
I'm not exactly sure. 
The weapon was stored in a pressurized canister. 
It was breached for maybe two minutes before I could seal it off. 
This is not a reaction. 
I've had these scars. 
This is a full-spectrum antibiotic. It should 
counteract a wide range of known pathogens. 
Step inside, sir. 
Raise your arms, close your eyes. 
 Janis, where are we? 
 Metro closed down a sixmile stretch of Highway 236. 
The C.D.C. First responders are on site. 
What the hell's going on? 
One of the bioweapon canisters was breached. 
 Jack may have been exposed. 
 Oh, my God. 
Starkwood took the canisters. 
They're probably flying 'em back to their main compound in Virginia... 
 along with Tony Almeida. 
 Almeida? 
He was working with Jack. We think he might 
have been taken captive. Hang on one second. 
I need you to put together a briefing packet on Starkwood. 
I want every division caught up to speed on what we might be dealing with. 
Planning to move on Starkwood? That place 
is enormous. It's practically a military base. 
We're not gonna do anything until we have concrete evidence on the bioweapon from C.D.C. 
Then I'll inform the president, and she'll decide how to proceed. 
Wait till I say! 
Easy! Easy! 
Almeida's not going to talk. 
He's not the type. 
He's the brave type. 
"Know the psychology of your subject." 
That's in our manual. 
Here we go. 
Mr. Hodges. 
We isolated the damaged canister. 
We got lucky. 
They know we have the weapons. 
That's not so lucky. 
How fast can you have them ready? 
 It's gonna take me at least two hours. 
 Too long, Tom. 
 Sir, we don't know what the government knows. 
 They're coming. 
And they'll be coming with everything they've got. 
And the only thing that's gonna stop them is getting these weapons ready to deploy. 
Yes, sir. I'll do my best. 
I know you will. 
Okay, let's go! 
    What does the F.B.I. Know? 
I'm not gonna ask you again. 
    Okay. 
You're a good man, Tony. 
I know your profile. 
You've had some hard breaks. 
I don't want to see you hurt. 
So you just tell me what the F.B.I. Knows... 
about what we're doin' here. 
And I can't say you'll walk away smiling. 
That would be unrealistic. 
But you'll be alive. 
You hear me? 
But I don't know anything, Mr. Hodges. 
I'm giving you a way out, Tony. 
Sir. May I speak to you for a moment? 
 Not now, Greg. 
 Please, sir. Just for a moment. 
What is it? 
This was supposed to be a covert operation. 
That is not the case anymore. 
The government knows that we have these weapons... 
and they're not just gonna sit on that information. 
What are you suggesting, Greg? 
Maybe we should destroy the evidence while we still have some time. 
I can't believe that I'm hearing this from you. 
I'm just trying to help, sir. I care about 
this company as much as you do. 
Oh, I doubt that. 
We've invested a lot of blood and treasure to get these weapons... 
and I'm not gonna give them up. 
Think about what you're risking, sir- everything. 
Everything you built. 
You say you're trying to help. 
You know what I think? 
I think you're worried about your own ass. 
Get him out of here and do what you have to do. 
Think about what I said, young man. 
You're a little nervous, Greg. 
We'll, I've got a news flash. We're all nervous. 
Keep your doubts to yourself. 
I'm not gonna tell you again. 
We're gonna need more blood and saliva samples, and I'd like to collect a spinal fluid specimen. 
Until we know what we're dealing with, we need to keep you under quarantine. 
How long till you know whether or not I've been infected? 
We should have the preliminary results in the next 15 minutes. 
 Okay. 
 Dr. Macer. 
 Yeah? 
 We've detected trace amounts of an airborne pathogen. 
It's concentrated near the truck. 
We're also picking it up from the surrounding environments in much lower concentrations. 
 Can you identify it? 
 No. But we're analyzing a sample now. 
These levels shouldn't present any danger to the nearby population... 
but I still want atmospheric monitors set up. 
It's a good thing you sealed off the canister, Mr. Bauer. You saved a lot of lives. 
You're gonna have to transport me back to F.B.I. 
I'm still material evidence in an ongoing terrorist threat. 
 Those were our orders. 
We can run our tests from there. 
 Okay. 
BobJustman's been associate counsel for the past three years. 
He and Ethan worked very closely together. 
He's certainly qualified to be chief of staff. 
But? 
After what's happened today, I think you should be looking outside your administration. 
An insider has a leg up. 
Chief of staff has a steep learning curve. 
I think you're underestimating the value of a fresh perspective. 
You have someone in mind. 
I do. Rick Berman. 
Would Rick even consider leaving the private sector? 
He's made his fortune. I think he'd jump 
at the chance to serve his country. 
 Let's sit down with him. 
 Great. 
But keep Bob on the list. 
I still have a good feeling about him. 
I'll start to set up meetings tomorrow. 
Livy, it could take weeks to find Ethan's replacement. 
In the meantime, I'm going to need a provisional chief of staff. 
I'd like that to be you. 
 Um     Madam President? 
 Yes? 
Tim Woods is here to see you. 
 Just give me a minute, please, and then send him in. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
Livy, I need someone I can trust... 
especially after everything that's happened today. 
You're not going to say no to your mother, are you? 
Of- Of course not. 
 Good. 
  Madam President, I have Larry Moss at F.B.I. Calling for you. 
 What's this about? 
 I don't know the specifics... 
but he says it involves an imminent homeland threat. 
Put him through. 
It's all right, Tim. 
I've made Olivia acting chief of staff. 
Agent Moss, you're on with the president. 
Madam President, we have a situation developing. 
First of all, you need to know thatJack Bauer... 
did not kill Ryan Burnett nor Senator Blaine Mayer. 
 He was framed for their murders. 
 I knew it. Who framed him? 
Our operational theory is that he was set up by Starkwood. 
I don't understand. 
Why would Starkwood frameJack? 
To cover up the fact that they helped Juma stage the terrorist attacks today. 
 What? 
 Ma'am, we have evidence that Starkwood provided Juma... 
with technological support and intelligence. 
In return, Juma allowed Starkwood to use Sangala... 
as a base to operate without having to worry about any oversight. 
 A base for what? 
 To manufacture weapons of mass destruction. 
Specifically, biological weapons. 
What kind of bioweapons are you talking about? 
We're not sure, but it could be some kind of neurological pathogen. 
C.D.C. Obtained a sample. 
They're analyzing it now. 
Agent Moss, you said there was an imminent threat? 
Yes. A large shipment of bioweapons 
was delivered to Starkwood. 
We believe they're in possession of them now. 
Are you saying these weapons are on U.S. Soil? 
We suspect they're at the Starkwood headquarters in Virginia. 
You're not suggesting Starkwood intends to use those weapons to attack this country? 
We don't know. 
But given their actions today... 
we need to move on Starkwood immediately. 
Madam President? 
Assemble the cabinet and theJoint Chiefs. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Jack was right about Starkwood. 
You find evidence that they've been supporting Juma? 
Yeah. 
Did you find out why? 
What could Starkwood possibly get from Juma? 
The infrastructure to develop and test biological weapons. 
We think they're holding 'em somewhere on the Starkwood compound. 
Okay. Where's Jack? 
He's... on his way over here. 
What, Larry? Larry? 
He managed to secure the weapons... 
but then, uh, Starkwood got 'em back. 
And when that happened, um... 
Jack was exposed. 
He may have been infected. 
He's being placed under quarantine. 
Listen, he's on his way here, and we need to find out... 
everything that he learned about these weapons... 
and I think you should be the one who debriefs him. 
And I owe you an apology. 
I was wrong not to trust you. 
L-I let my prejudice about Bauer get in the way. 
But, Renee, you should have kept me in the loop. 
You should have trusted me. 
I know. 
I should have. 
When are we moving on Starkwood? 
Aaron. Uh 
I'll check in with you guys later, okay? 
Thank you. 
 May I speak with you for a moment? 
 Of course. 
I heard you finished your debrief and were on your way out. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Well, I need you to stay. 
 Ma'am? 
 I've been appointed acting chief of staff. 
The Secret Service is going to assign an agent to handle my security detail. 
I'd like that to be you. 
Well, I'm truly flattered, ma'am, but as you know, I'm retired. 
I can have you reinstated. 
There are plenty of fine agents on the roster. 
But I don't want them. I want you. 
I can't go into the details now, but the threat to this country isn't over. 
We're in the middle of a crisis, and I need people around me I can trust. 
I trust you, Aaron. 
I can't say that about a lot of people. 
I'm running into a meeting with the president. 
I'll assume your answer is yes. 
 Gentlemen, ladies, please take your seats. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
Here's the packet. 
Now those of you who haven't had a chance to finish your briefing packets, please keep reading. 
As we've all just learned, this day is not over. 
Our national security is still being threatened... 
and we are here to consider our options. 
Mr. Woods. 
Your briefing materials include F.B.I. Intelligence... 
about a cache of biological weapons on Starkwood's main compound in Northern Virginia. 
This is a recent satellite view of the compound. 
Over three square miles, 259 structures. 
The weapons could be hidden anywhere on the facility. 
What kind ofbioweapons are we talking about? 
This is Ben Landry. 
He's director of C.D.C. 
He's here to answer any questions you may have in regards to the pathogen. Ben? 
I've just received a preliminary report from our agents in the field. 
They've identified the pathogen as a prion variant indigenous to the East Congo. 
It's a form of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. 
It attacks the brain and the nervous system... 
causes dementia, physical deterioration... 
ultimately death. 
Now, standard C.J.D. Kills within several months, 
but this strain kills more quickly. 
 How long? 
 A day. Maybe two. 
There's no treatment for this disease. There's no cure. 
If dispersed over a populated area, the results would be catastrophic. 
But it goes without saying we cannot allow a private military force, these killers... 
to possess weapons of mass destruction. 
We need to find these weapons and arrest those bastards in Starkwood... 
who are responsible for bringing 'em here. 
Uh, Madam President. 
Given the size of the compound, it would take a considerable force to locate these weapons. 
Not to mention the fact that there are 1,500 highly trained mercenaries on that base. 
God forbid they decide to resist. 
We could have a small war in our own backyard. 
I share those concerns, Madam President. 
We also have to consider... 
the possibility that Starkwood might use these biological weapons against our own forces. 
What about an air strike? 
A facility that large would require multiple bombing runs. 
We'd be looking at massive casualties on the Starkwood base... 
with no guarantee of destroying the bioweapons. 
For all we know, they've been buried underground or in fortified facilities. 
There's also a risk that hitting these weapons... 
with insufficient force could release the bio-agent into the atmosphere. 
We can'tjust ignore the law here. 
All these scenarios... 
would be in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. 
I mean, we can't deploy military personnel in a law enforcement capacity... 
not without congressional approval. 
Now, what I'm hearing is that there are no good options. 
I don't accept that. 
Until we find a way to contain this threat... 
we are risking another attack on this country... 
and that is an option I won't consider. 
Mr. Hodges wants to know 
if you've given any thought to his offer. 
Why this loyalty to a government that screwed you over? 
I don't get it. Just tell us what 
the F.B.I. Knows, and you can walk. 
For the record, I bet Mr. Hodges 
a pair of Redskin tickets... 
you wouldn't talk. 
Looks like I'm gonna be sitting on the 50-yard line. 
Hey. 
Hey, what the hell's going on? 
 I need your help. 
 My help? 
We need to stop this. It's gone too far. 
Look, I'm not goin' anywhere till you tell me why you're doin' this. 
I'm not spending the rest of my life in prison becauseJonas Hodges has lost his mind. 
 You know where the weapons are? 
 Yes. 
 Then you better tell me right now. 
 I want immunity. 
I can't promise you anything. 
We can call the F.B.I. 
And negotiate a deal. 
Immunity in exchange for your help in recovering the weapons. That's the best I can do. 
I can set up a secure landline in my office. 
Okay. Let's go. 
We're pulling up to F.B.I. 
We have to put you in an isolation suit to transfer you to the quarantine area. 
 I understand. 
 How are you feeling? 
No different. 
 We have the results of Mr. Bauer's blood work. 
 Thank you. 
Open it. 
Thank you. 
Excuse me. Larry wanted me to tell you 
that C.D.C. Arrived with Jack Bauer. 
 I'll meet them down in quarantine. 
 He's not in quarantine. 
 I don't understand. 
 That's all I know. 
They just cleared security. 
He's on his way up. 
Jack. Are you okay? 
My blood work came in positive. 
I'm infected. 
 Mr. Bauer, 
there's a room for you to change in. 
Thank you. 
It's fine. 
But he's not in quarantine. 
We've learned the disease isn't contagious. 
It was engineered that way to prevent blowback on the people deploying it. 
Okay, but there has to be something that you can do to help him. 
There's no cure. 
But he's patient zero. 
Whatever we learn from the pathogen will come from the tests we still need to run. 
Excuse me. 
   This is Macer. 
He's stable for the moment. 
   Yeah? 
Jack, um I don't know what to say. 
You can tell me that Agent Moss followed up on Starkwood. 
Sorry. 
Larry debriefed the White House... 
and we're waiting on the president to decide on a course of action. 
Good. Any word on Tony? 
Sorry. We don't know anything yet. 
I need to debrief you on the canisters that you saw. 
 You okay with that? 
 Yeah. 
Okay. 
I've read the statement from the port authority cop. 
He said that you risked the mission to save his life. 
You did the right thing. 
Thanks. 
Uh, it's the lab. 
It's probably Hodges. 
I should talk to him. 
Put it on speaker. 
Seaton. 
Where the hell have you been? 
I've been trying to reach you. 
I was, uh, checking on Almeida. 
 Did Stokes get him to talk? 
 He's still working on that, sir. 
I told him to put Almeida down if he didn't start talking. 
I think we should give him a few more minutes, sir. 
We're busting our asses to get these weapons ready before the government makes their move. 
I want all hands on deck. 
 We'll be there soon, sir. 
 See that you are, Greg. 
Call F.B.I. 
I need to set up the secure landline, make sure nobody's listening. 
 All right. Well, do it. 
  I never thoughtJonas would take it this far. 
I mean, the man's a patriot. 
He founded Starkwood to protect this country. 
Yeah? Well, why's he attacking it? 
It's complicated. 
I don't understand it myself. 
I should have done more to stop this. 
I should have called F.B.I. Months ago. 
Well, you're doin' the right thing now. 
I pulled together everything we have on Starkwood. 
Structural specs, aerial maps, topography, company rosters- the whole works. 
All right. Upload it onto 
the interagency servers. 
Let's get everybody on the same page. 
That's good work, Janis. Renee. 
I heard aboutJack. I'm sorry. 
I'm still debriefing him, but I brought a full description of the canisters. 
Good. 
Get this out to the field agents. 
How's he doin'? 
Hard to tell. 
Larry, so many people have died today. 
We cannot let their deaths be for nothing. 
 We won't. 
 Larry? 
I've got Tony Almeida on the phone. 
 Almeida? 
 He says he's calling from inside Starkwood. 
Put him through. Go ahead, Tony. 
 Who am I talking to? 
 It's Larry Moss. What's going on? 
I'm on the Starkwood compound. 
I was being held by a man named Jonas Hodges... 
but I was released by one of his executives a man named Greg Seaton. 
He wants to cut a deal. 
He wants immunity. 
 What's he offering in return? 
 He knows where the weapons are being held. 
All right, Tony, I gotta run this by the president. 
Wait, Larry. Do you know what happened toJack? 
He's here. He's in medical. 
 Was he hit? 
 No. One of the canisters was breached. 
He's been infected. 
Tony, I gotta call the White House. 
Stand by. Janis, set up a secure connection 
in the conference room... 
with Almeida and the White House for signature. 
And get me the president on the phone. 
  What is this? 
 Footage recovered from Sangala. 
It was smuggled out of the remains of a biological weapons lab... 
about 45 minutes ago. 
It's a confirmation thatJuma was experimenting... 
with biological weapons on the local population. 
These poor people were suffering from the effects of the weaponized prion variant. 
And that's what we allowed Starkwood to bring into this country. 
We didn't allow this. 
Starkwood is a monster we created, Olivia. 
We have been feeding it for years. 
We gave them military contracts. 
We relied on their paid mercenaries instead of our own soldiers... 
outsourced intelligence gathering operations. 
My God, we even passed a law so that they could build a military base... 
13 miles from the nation's capital. 
You fought against all that. 
You've been trying to limit Starkwood's power ever since you took office. 
I didn't do enough... fast enough. 
 And now it may be too late. 
   Madam President, Tim Woods and Admiral Smith are here to see you. 
 Send them in. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
Madam President, Larry Moss at F.B.I. 
Is calling in. He says it's urgent. 
 Put him through. 
 Agent Moss, the president's here. Go ahead. 
Madam President, we've been contacted by someone inside Starkwood. 
 Ma'am, it's Tony Almeida. 
 Almeida? 
He's been working with Jack Bauer to recover these weapons. 
He was taken captive, but then released by someone on the inside. 
His name is Greg Seaton. 
He's part ofJonas Hodges's inner circle. 
Ma'am, he says he's willing to tell us where the weapons are in exchange for immunity. 
I've already started mobilizing for a targeted raid. 
We can catch 'em by surprise and lock down these weapons. 
But I'm gonna need you to sign an immunity agreement for this man. 
How confident are you of Seaton's intel? 
We believe it's genuine, ma'am. 
Madam President, we may not get a chance like this again. 
 Admiral Smith? 
 I concur. 
But I would suggest we supplement the F.B.I. With a SEAL squad. 
They're ready to move on my order. 
The Attorney General will raise hell about us involving the military in this operation. 
We'll deal with him later. 
Agent Moss, you have my direct authorization to move on Starkwood. 
How soon can you be ready? 
We've already drafted an executive pardon and set it up via WebEx. 
You'll be able to give a secure digital signature, and we're good to go. 
We have the document set up at your assistant's computer. 
Agent Moss, the president is prepared to sign. 
Go ahead, ma'am. 
All right, it's done. 
 Did you get a signature? 
 Yeah, we're good. 
 When can you be at Starkwood? 
 We can be there in 10 minutes. 
Agent Moss, thank you, and good luck. 
Thank you, ma'am. Let's go. 
Madam President, we may have just caught a lucky break. 
Until this plays out, I want everyone to keep looking for other options. 
All right, Mr. Seaton, go ahead. 
The weapons are in a warehouse on the northeast quadrant of the compound. 
3244.23 North... 
11710.42 West. 
Mr. Seaton, it would help to have someone 
on the ground doing recon. 
 Can you get Tony to that warehouse? 
 I think so. 
See if you can get ahold of a hand radio. 
We'll be on 480 kilohertz. 
All right. We'll be there. 
We land here, we'll be within 50 yards of the warehouse. 
Yeah. Support teams here and here, 
shore us up. Coordinate with the navy. 
 Get moving. I'll meet you upstairs. 
 Let's move. 
You're mobilizing. What's going on? 
We got a call from Tony. He's working 
with an informant inside Starkwood. 
We got a location on the weapon. We're getting 
ready to stage a raid on the compound. 
 I want to go. 
 I can understand why. But I'm sorry. 
 I can't allow it. 
 Larry, I can help you with this. 
I'm the only one who's seen the canisters. 
I know exactly what we're looking for. 
I read your debrief. 
You gave us all the details we need. 
Larry, please. I've earned this. 
Jack, I know what you've done today... 
the sacrifice you've made. 
Under any other circumstances, I'd want you out there with us. 
But you're sick. We have no idea 
when you're gonna start showing symptoms. 
I cannot risk that happening out in the field. 
I need my best men for this operation. 
I hope you can understand that. 
You're right. 
You're right. 
Yeah.  
I always knew eventually we'd agree on something. 
I'm so sorry, Jack. 
 Mr. Seaton? 
 Murphy, I need to check the personnel records  That's it. 
The weapons are inside there. 
 How many men inside? 
Hodges, munitions team, security I'm guessing a dozen or more. 
Wolves are at the door, Tommy. 
 How much longer? 
 We're still an hour away from being armed, sir. 
We just intercepted a government transmission. 
F.B.I. On the way. 
Sir, we haven't even run the sequence checks yet. 
Let's do it. Damn it. 
 What's our E.T.A. 
 Two minutes, sir. 
 Tony, it's Larry Moss. Are you in position? 
 Affirmative. 
 I'm about 50 yards north of the warehouse. 
 What can you tell me? 
We've got two entrances, north and south. Heavy steel doors. 
Two guards, armed with automatic weapons. 
Seaton says there's probably about a dozen inside. 
 I think we have to assume they're armed as well. 
 All right, we're almost there. 
I'm gonna need your eyes on the ground in case there's any resistance. 
 Copy that. 
 Aerial 1 to home base. 
Target has been confirmed. 
We are go for tac plan alpha. 
Copy that, Aerial 1. All feeds are live. 
We're monitoring your approach. 
 Sir, we're being signaled by Starkwood's air tower. 
 Let me talk to 'em. 
 You're on. 
 This is Special Agent Larry Moss from F.B.I. 
We have an executive order from the president of the United States... 
to search one of your buildings. 
F.B.I. I'll need to get authorization 
from my superiors. 
We have sent you a digital copy of the executive order. 
Check your wireless frequency. 
That is all the authorization you will need. 
Make no attempt to interfere, or you will be arrested. Do you understand? 
 Do you understand? 
 Understood, F.B.I. 
Take us in. 
Aerial 1 to home base. 
We are good to go. 
Copy that, Aerial 1. Looks like you have 
a clean approach.  
No hostiles in sight. 
 (HDTV SUBTITLES FROM HERE)  added by w3sten MOSS: You all right? 
We have a medic. 
I'm fine. 
Seaton, I need you to stay behind us. 
Let's go. 
Stand down! 
You were told to stand down! 
Lower your weapons and get on the ground now! 
Lock them down! 
It's locked, sir. 
Blow it. 
Blasting! 
Three. Two. One! 
Go. Go! 
Where are the weapons? 
I don't know. 
What do you mean, you don't know? 
Almeida was threatening to kill me. 
I told him what he wanted to hear. 
You lying son of a bitch! You came to me! 
Now, where are the weapons?! 
Where are the damn weapons?! 
Tell him to take his hands off of me. 
Tony? Tony! I need you 
to stand down now! 
You're not getting away with this. 
Secure him! 
He's lying, Larry. 
(panting) He played me. 
Yeah, I know. 
It looks that way. 
Well, what do you know? 
Little old Seaton bought us some time. 
They're on the other side of the compound. 
We just have to keep them there. 
There's nothing here, sir. 
(sighs) Renee, the warehouse is empty. 
Tony's informant sent us to the wrong location. 
This whole thing was a diversion. 
They couldn't have gotten them out that fast. 
The weapons are there somewhere. 
Larry, the weapons have to be inside of Starkwood. 
Tell them to keep looking. 
Stand by. 
All right, everyone outside now. 
All right, listen up. 
We're going to do a point-by-point search of this entire compound. 
Good. 
MOSS: I want four teams sweeping every structure on this property. 
(tires squealing, engines revving) (tires squealing) Jack. 
(engines revving) MOSS: Hold your fire! 
Hold your fire. 
(tires squeak) Hold your fire. 
Stay in position. 
(mumbling softly) Tell Larry to have his men stand down. 
Are you kidding me? They just 
drew on federal forces. 
If you don't want to lose your men, you'll get them to stand down now. Now! 
(tires squeal) MOSS: Hold your fire! 
That's far enough. 
We cooperated with your demand to search this building. 
Now, we're asking you to leave. 
MOSS: There are biological weapons on this facility. 
We're not going anywhere without them. 
Now, tell your men to stand down. 
Those charges are absurd, and we're not going to let you keep searching. 
You're on private property, and we're prepared to defend it if necessary. 
You are threatening federal agents. 
Stand down! Now! 
We're protecting our rights against a hostile government that's using false charges to try to shut us down. 
Now, we don't want any bloodshed. 
But if you try to advance any farther, you will be fired upon. 
Season07 Episode21 ****** Have you secured the canister? 
I'm afraid not,ma'am. 
Our suspect escaped beyond the perimeter. 
I was told that the area was locked down. What happened? 
He had help from tony almeida. 
Almeida? He was working for us. 
It only appeared that way. 
Apparently he was pursuing his own agenda,trying to get his hands on the canister. 
We're all regrouping to develop leads. 
I may have one. 
As hodges was taken into custody,he yelled at me about some larger group that would continue on after his arrest. 
If that's the case,madam president,we need to talk to him. 
I need you to call the attorney general and draft a witness protection agreement for jonas hodges. 
There's no other way he'll talk. 
This man mdered your son,not to mention hundreds of innocent civilians. 
Is there anything else that I can do for you? 
Other than kill jonas hodges,no. 
I didn't mean that. 
You know,you're right. We shouldn't 
be talking about this over the phone. 
How soon can you be at thehite house? 
 How's 15 minutes sound? 
 Good. 
The plan was to launch simultaneous attacks early next year in multiple cities, so the public would finally see that the government can't protect them. 
They'd demand drastic measures,and we'd step in. 
We were going to supply the  enemies that want to destroy this country muhammad this,achmed that. 
Mr. Hodges,I need the names of the 
people that you are working with. 
 I don't have any... 
 I want the names! 
I don't know any! 
Another attack today is all we need to push this thing right over the edge. 
This is no time to pull back. 
I say we take that canister and finish the job off today. 
I'll contact the group. 
The attack will be attributed to this man jibraan al-zarian. 
We're talking about launching a new operation in the next few hours and with only one canister. 
The plan for this operation was already in place. 
We'd just be accelerating the timetable. 
Jonas hodges was a loose cannon,and the group is well rid of him, but,in his lunacy,he did us a favor. 
I say we take it. 
Hamid! 
Keep your mouth shut and no one gets hurt. 
 You understand? 
 Yes! 
****** How much more time do you need? 
The material's almost finished downloading. 
Financial records are in place. 
I'm gonna need about another 15 minutes to alter the time stamps. 
Good. 
I'm gonna take this off. 
You yell for help,you and your brother die. Understand? 
Who are you people? 
You're putting jihadi propaganda on my computer. 
These weapons you're... 
you're trying to make me look like a terrorist. Why are you doing this? 
Listen to me,jibraan. 
There's only one thing you need to know. 
If you d't do exactly as I say, you're going to watch your younger brother die right in front of your eyes. 
And then... I'm gonna kill you. 
However... if you cooperate... 
there's a good chance the two of you will live through this. 
What do you want me to do? 
First off... 
you're going to read this statement in front of a camera, and you're going to read it like you mean it. 
No,this is insane. I can't read 
this. I'm not going to do this. 
Okay,see,that sounds to me like you think you have a choice. 
Please,this is not right. 
You can't do this to us. 
Okay,fine. 
Okay,okay,please please don't hurt him. 
I'll do whatever you say. Okay? 
I'll give you five minutes to look that over. 
I just finished the first sweep with the ctu servers. 
There's been no chatter,no activity at all. 
You updated the watch list? 
Yes,everyone on that list is already under surveillance by law enforcement. 
If one of them was gonna do something,we would know about it. 
Damn,well,we're going to have to widen our parameter. 
To include what? 
I want you to check out every muslim in the washington D.C.Area. 
Target anyone who's working in a sensitive government position or in a place that might get hit. 
Then I want you to start pulling the files on every political activist working in the muslim community. 
Also,I want you to contact ins. 
I want a list of every recent immigrant from an islamic country. 
Excuse me,has anybody heard of racial profiling? 
Janis,not now. 
No,she's right. 
You're right,this is racial profiling,and I don't like it any more than you do, but hodges told me specifically that he was going to utilize muslim extremists in an effort to offload the blame for this attack. 
I need to know who he's working with,and we're running out of time. 
I don't know a better way of doing this. 
So if you do,please tell me now. 
No. 
Okay,thank you. 
Chloe,I need you to run down the list of... 
I-I'm sorry,I forgot what I was saying. 
Ins records,jack? 
Yeah,run those down first and then work backwards. 
Excuse me. 
This is the second time he's done this. 
He keeps forgetting things,he looks like hell. 
He's doing pretty well,considering. 
Considering? Considering what? 
 He didn't tell you? 
 Tell me what? 
If there's something wrong with jack,tell me now. 
He's sick,chloe. He was 
infected with the prion variant. 
How? 
He was trying to recover the bioweapon canisters and one of them ruptured. He was exposed. 
Oh,my god. 
I'm sorry,chloe,he probably didn't want you to worry. Chloe... 
why didn't you tell me you were sick? 
It doesn't matter. 
It doesn't matter? I'm your friend. 
We need to stay focused on finding tony. 
Jack,you should be in the hospital. 
There's no treatment for this. 
There's no cure. 
so you're telling me you're dying? 
Yes. 
How long? 
A day,maybe two. 
I've been taking this anti-seizure medicine to keep me on my feet. 
It's been working so far. 
Oh,my god. I'm so sorry. 
Chloe,it's all right. 
I've accepted it... 
and I need you to accept it,too. 
Whatever time I've got left,I want it to matter. 
We need to find tony,put an end to this. 
chloe. 
I can't do this without you. 
Please,I need you to go back to work. 
okay. 
We strike this blow for our brothers and sisters who have died at the hands of this corrupt nation. 
The hour is here,and we are ready for the war that is to come. 
Our fighters will not rest until amica lies crippled and dying, her streets running with blood,and her people begging for mercy,but there will be none... 
 only our vengeance. 
 We have a problem. 
 What is it? 
 Police. 
Why don't you,uh... 
close down the computer and get out of sight. 
Take everything down and watch the brother. 
 You need to come with me. 
 What is happening? 
There are two police officers outside. 
I want you to find out what they want and convince them that everything's okay in here. 
jibraan... 
don't try to warn them. 
Dcpd. Open the door,please. 
Yes? 
"Jibrain" al-zarian? 
Jibraan al-zarian. 
Uh,we got a call from one of your neighbors. 
They said they heard some yelling coming from your apartment, saw some people they didn't recognize enter the premises,thought there might be some trouble. 
No,everything is fine. 
Those were friends of mine. 
And what about the yelling? 
We got into an argument. 
They were drinking a little too much. Uh,it was nothing. 
Where are your friends now,sir? 
you know,they got too loud,so I asked them to leave. 
They won't be back. 
I'm very sorry for the noise. 
it won't happen again. I-I promise. 
Okay. Just keep it down from now on. 
I will. 
 Have a good night. 
 You,too. 
All right,we're clear. 
You did good,jibraan. 
We have to finish reading this statement before we take off. 
Where are we going? 
Don't worry about that. 
You just keep doing as we say,and you and your brother are gonna make it through this,all right? 
Set him up. 
And there will be none,only our vengeance. 
And this is only the beginning. 
We will strike again and again in the name of all that is great and righteous. 
I think I've got something. 
Agent walker? What is it? 
One of the filters flagged this a few minutes ago. I just finished vetting it. 
These are multiple deposits over a period of six months. 
They're from an overseas muslim relief organization called the islamic league for world peace. 
A total of two million dollars to the washington continental bank. 
Every penny of it was withdrawn within 30 minutes. 
What name's on the account? 
Jibraan al-zarian. 
He's 27 years old,moved here from pakistan on a student visa four years ago. 
This is his personal web account. 
These are some of the sites he's been looking at recently. 
We got an address on him? 
No. This address is 
false. It doesn't exist. 
Yeah,his visa expired. He's here illegally,and 
he probably doesn't want to be found. 
 He does have a personal reference on his ins form. 
 Who? 
Muhtadi gohar. He lives at the 
g street mosque in georgetown. 
He's the imam there. 
He might be able to help us find al-zarian. We need to talk to him. 
Put out an apb on al-zarian,run it through the interagency database. 
See what else you can find. 
Fax everything over to the car. Great work. 
Jack,wait. 
Are you sure you're up for this? 
I have to see this through. 
Please. I can help. 
Okay. Let's go. 
come in. 
Ma'am,mr. Collier to see you. 
Thank you,agent pierce. That'll be all. 
I appreciate you coming,martin. 
It's been a long time. You look good. 
Thanks. 
So,olivia,I know why you asked me here,but I have to tell you, having me dig up dirt on noah daniels is one thing. 
This is a whole different animal. 
I'm aware of that,martin. 
I want this to happen. I want 
this person taken care of. 
 It's jonas hodges. 
 Starkwood? 
Yes. 
What in god's name do you have against him? 
I don't know how much of this will get out,but hodges was behind everything that happened today, from the planes going down to the attack on the white house. 
 What? 
 It's true. 
He's also responsible for the death of my brother. 
I thought your brother killed himself. 
He was murdered,and hodges was responsible. 
Okay. But why? 
It's complicated,martin,and I don't have time to go into it. 
All you need to know is,hodges worked a deal. 
Witness protection. My mother 
approved it,and he's going free... 
unless someone intervenes. 
Okay,can I give you a little advice? 
 What? 
 This is big game. Walk away. 
I can't do that. 
Once this happens,once it goes through,you can never go back. 
You will live with it for the rest of your life. 
I don't need a lecture on conscience from you,of all people. 
I have thought this through. 
What I can't live with is that monster getting away with this. 
He has to pay for what he did. 
So,uh,where's hodges now? 
In fbi custody,downtown bureau. 
Deal has been signed. 
He's being released into witness protection within the hour. 
Here's his itinerary. 
When he walks out that door,we lose him. 
He disappears forever. 
This has got to happen fast. 
Martin. 
All right. I'll make a call. 
I'll get you contact information,a price,and instructions on how to transfer the funds. 
Thank you. 
You'll hear from me soon. 
mr. Hodges,this is U.S.Marshal sullivan. 
I'm placing you in his custody. 
He'll take you to witness protection. 
Thank you for your hospitality,young lady. 
This dossier outlines your newdentity,your new place of residence, all the information you're going to need to make this transition. 
Robert tippett? That's my new name? 
Yes,sir. 
Sounds like a dog breed. 
Our first stop is the witt-sec facility in colorado. 
We'll put the finishing touches on your new biography,fabricate your new id,  get you into counseling. 
 Counseling? 
It helps entrants deal with their new circumstances. 
Son,you know who I am. 
Do I impress you as someone who needs therapy to cope with new circumstances? 
The service is available if you want it,sir,courtesy of the american taxpayer. 
You think I'm getting off easy,don't you? 
I don't think anything. 
I can smell attitude,son,and you're giving it off pretty thick. 
I've lost everything my company,my family,and most importantly,my name. 
Do you know how much blood and sweat went into making that name mean something? 
We leave for andrews air force base in 30 minutes. 
I suest you get ready. 
Jack? 
I'm fine. 
What are you doing? We don't even 
know that they've done anything yet. 
 They could be innocent. 
 Innocent? 
You heard hodges. They're gonna use 
sleeper cells to carry out these attacks. 
Al-zarian might not have been knowingly complicit about everything that happened today, but innocent?No. 
Yes? 
This is agent walker with fbi. Mr. Gohar? 
Yes. 
We're sorry to bother you at such a late hour,but we need your help. 
My help? 
To stop a potential terrorist attack. 
mr. Gohar? 
I know you. 
My name is jack bauer. 
Of course. 
I watched your testimony on television. 
Sir,can we talk to you inside? 
Please. 
what do you want? 
We're looking for a man who worships here. 
We believe he may be helping to plan another attack that may be happening soon,in D.C. 
I knew the blame would eventually fall on us. 
His name is jibraan al-zarian.Do you know him? 
And why do you think he's a terrorist? 
He fits a specific profile. 
You mean,he is a muslim. 
He's a pakistani national.His visa lapsed a year ago. 
And he has no legal address. 
He listed you as a personal reference on his ins form. 
Where someone worships is private information,protected by law. 
Right now,finding al-zarian is the only way we're going to prevent an attack against civilians. 
So,I ask you again,sir,do you know him? 
Look at the photo! 
Yes,I know him.But he is not a terrorist! 
What makes you so sure? 
Jibraan has come to me many times for spiritual advice. 
I know the man. 
He is not violent and he is not an extremist. 
We have evidence that indicates otherwise. 
I would like to see this evidence. 
Listen to me.We did not come here to debate this with you. 
Where does he live? 
I don't know where he lives. 
Where does he work? 
I don't know that,either. 
And I don't believe you! 
But you expect me to believe you? 
I watched your hearing at the senate,I know what you have done. 
So,tell me why should I belie anything you say to me? 
First because you don't have a choice. 
Second,because I am telling you the truth! 
The truth is that you come into a house of worship with information you should not have, an outrageous accusation,no legal warrant,and threaten me. 
I have not threatened you. 
Not yet. 
But we both know where this is going. 
If you're so sure he's innocent,why are you afraid to tell us where he is? 
Jack... 
where is he? 
I told you,I don't know. 
But even if I did,I would say nothing. 
I would not help you arrest an innocent man. 
this is agent walker. 
It's janis. 
A dcpd officer recognized jibraan al-zarian from a domestic disturbance call he took 15 minutes ago. 
The address is 2700 eastbrook,apartment 3. 
All right,good.Coordinate with dcpd. 
Set up an envelope and put the building under surveillance.We'll be there in 10 minutes. 
We have an address on al-zarian.Let's go,jack. 
Turn around. 
Why? 
I said turn around. 
Put your hands up,now! 
Jack? 
What are you doing,jack? 
I'm not letting him call al-zarian before we get there. 
He's coming with us. 
You have no right!I have done nothing wrong! 
Shut up! 
There will be none,only our vengeance. 
And this is only the beginning. 
We will strike again and again in the name of all that is great and righteous. 
All right,fine. 
The staging team's ready and waiting on us. 
This'll be uploaded in two minutes. 
Good. 
Jibraan... 
we're getting ready to move out. 
I'm gonna need you to talk to your brother. 
Tell him what we discussed. 
Go ahead and wake him up. 
Please,I can't do this. 
Yes,you can. 
And you will. 
How do I know you won't kill hamid anyway? 
Because we need him  to tell the police that his brother's a terrorist. 
Believe me,you're saving his life by doing this. 
Now,come on,let's go. 
Hamid,hamid,calm down.Don't be scared. 
Jibraan,what is this? 
Sorry we had to do it th way. 
But you're not going to be hurt anymore,okay? 
We?Who is we?What's happening? 
I'll explain everything to you,okay? 
Who's he? 
Um,he's a friend. 
Your friend?I know all your friends.I've never seen him before. 
That's because I have kept him from you. 
What are you talking about? 
I have to tell you something. 
I'm not the person you think I am. 
What? 
I hate what this country has done to our people. 
And I'm working with these men. 
They're going to help me strike back against the evil that has been done to us. 
Strike back? 
I can't say any more than that. 
I don't believe it. 
This country brought us in,gave us a home,that's what you always said. 
Yeah,that was a lie. 
I have been protecting you from this rage I've always felt inside. 
But now it is time for you to know the truth. 
It was the americans who killed our parents,hamid. 
I'm going to make them pay. 
What have you done to my brother?You've poisoned his mind!This isn't my brother! 
They have not done anything to me,okay. 
It is very important you accept what I'm saying to you. 
Why are you telling me this? 
When they ask you why I did what I did, I want you to tell them. 
Okay,no one will blame you for anything.You have done nothing wrong. 
I know this is very difficult for you to understand. 
But over time,you will see. 
I love you,hamid. 
You said today was a bad day to be a muslim. 
Well,it's an even worse day to be your brother. 
All right,let's go. 
Staging area's ready. 
You stay here and finish up. 
Understood. 
Jibraan,don't do this. 
Everything set? 
Yeah,was the brother convinced? 
I'm not sure. 
But even if he wasn't,once the attack happens,he will be. 
Let's go. 
Hello?Hello? 
Yes,yes,martin collier said you'd be expecting my call. 
He gave me the target's itinerary.I'm set to go. 
Good. 
Good,so the terms are acceptable. 
They are.I just need you to transfer the funds. 
What's the account number? 
International banking code is victor-six-bravo-one-bravo-one. 
Account number: Zero-five-nine -nine-zero-seven-two-four-seven. 
Ter the funds have been transferred,I'll proceed. 
There'll be no need for us to have any further contact. 
All right,but what e you--  hello? 
yes? 
Excuse me,ms.Taylor. 
I thought you should know your father has asked to see you. 
My father's here? 
In light of the potential bioweapon attack,the president ordered him moved to the white house for his safety. 
Thank you,aaron. 
I just have something to take care of. 
Tell them I'll be right there. 
Yes,ma'am. 
You've reached martin collier.Please leave a message. 
Martin,it's olivia taylor. 
I spoke to the contact,but I couldn't go through with it. 
I decided to take your advice and walk away. 
Please call me as soon as you can. 
this is bauer. 
Jack,it's chloe, I found something weird about these hits on jibraan al-zarian. 
Go ahead. 
You know how I said that the two million dollars was deposited into his account over a period of six months? 
Well,that wasn't right.They were backdated. 
What do you mean? 
One of the trace algorithms caught a discrepancy, all that money was really just deposited 30 minutes ago. 
What about the extremist websites he was visiting? 
Same thing with the time stamps. 
The hits were backdated 30 minutes ago. 
Are you absolutely positive? 
It looks that way. 
Jibraan could be innocent. 
Okay,thanks. 
What's going on,jack? 
Chloe found evidence that jibraan is being set up.He's been framed. 
Why would almeida frame an innocent man? 
Because they wouldn't want to risk the attack not being carried out properly. 
How could I be so stupid? 
An innocent man is so much easier to control. 
All they needed was a muslim,they could create whatever background they wanted. 
god...**** 
I am surprised. 
Why?You were right. 
Not about jibraan. 
My experience with the authorities,the police is that they will go to any lengths not to admit they were wrong. 
Even at the expense of an innocent man's life. 
At least you didn't do that. 
Please know that I forgive you. 
I'm not asking for your forgiveness. 
Then I hope you can at least forgive yourself. 
I gave up on that  a long time ago. 
It's never to late to turn towards god,mr. Bauer. 
That's enough? 
Yeah,thanks. 
Thank you. 
You don't need to stay with me,ally. 
But they know where to find me if they need me. 
I thought it was important for you to hear what's going on. 
And for you to understand why I did what I did. 
You're the president,sweetheart. 
You don't owe me an explanation. 
There's my girl. 
Hi,dad. 
Livy,you can squeeze a bit harder.I won't break. 
Oh,I might! 
I'm sorry I couldn't come to the hospital. 
Don't be silly. 
You're a godsend being here helping your mom. 
Just knowing you two were speaking again,let alone working together,that's enough. 
Henry,I'm not sure that our d�tente is holding at the moment. 
Olivia,your mother told me about the deal she made with jonas hodges. 
And I know you,understandably,have serious concerns about that. 
Well,I've had some time to think. 
To put myself in mom's position. 
To be objective and pragmatic-- the way a good leader should be. 
Has to be. 
I know that decision was horrible for you. 
But I do understand. 
I'm sorry I made thehoice even harder. 
Jonas hodges will face judgment one day. 
If not in this life,in the next. 
Mr. Tippet. 
Mr. Tippet. 
Sorry. 
It's going to take me a little while to get used to that. 
Always does. 
I'll need to confiscate the wallet. 
We can't let you hold on to anything that ties you to your former life. 
And the picture. 
You like your job,mr. Sullivan? 
It has its challenges. 
You strike me as someone who wouldn't be totally satisfied ferrying prisoners around. 
I don't plan on doing this my entire life. 
Good to hear that. 
Maybe you and I can do some work together some day. 
Sir? 
I don't intend to be mr. Tippet forever. 
Sign here acknowledging transfer. 
Fbi's identified the man they believe is going to carry out the bioweapon's attack. 
Jack bauer and agent walker are on their way to a possible location for him. 
Have they found out anything that would give us an idea of the target-- or a timetable? 
No.Nothing actionable.Not yet. 
Um,madam president. 
This is woods. 
Are you sure? 
How did this happen? 
Call me as soon as you know more. 
What is it,tim? 
Jonas hodges was just killed. 
What?How? 
Car bomb.As he was leaving fbi. 
What else do they know?Are there any suspects? 
Not yet. 
Um,excuse me. 
My guess is this was an inside job. 
Inside job? 
Whoever ordered the hit knew exactly when and where hodges was being transported. 
Damn it! 
Tim,get on top of this. 
I want to know exactly how this happened. 
Yes,ma'am. 
Ms.Taylor,is everything all right? 
Oh,it's fine.I'll be right back. 
Yeah? 
Hodges is dead! 
Okay,calm down.We shouldn't be talking on the phone. 
You don't understand,there's been a terrible mistake. 
I spoke to the man whose number you gave me. 
But I didn't go through with it. 
I couldn'T.Didn't you get my message? 
Olivia,I said calm down. 
I can't! 
Hodges is dead and I'm responsible. 
We cannot have this conversation over the phone.Do you understand? 
Do you realize what could happen to me if this gets out? 
Olivia,you need to stop talking now.Do you hear me? 
Take a deep breath,lien to me.All right,we'll hang up,okay? 
All right. 
Okay,I'm listening. 
Can you get to pershing park? 
No,not right now.I'm in a meeting with my mother. 
Fine.I'll wait.Get there as fast as you can. 
We'll talk about this face-to-face.Okay? 
All right. 
Thank you,aaron. 
What do you have,agent? 
Armed hostile in the back room,holding a hostage. 
What about almeida? 
He's not in there.See for yourself. 
Reed,give us another look. 
Yes,sir. 
Move in closer on the hostage. 
Is that who you're looking for? 
No.That's jibraan's brother,hamid. 
They're using him as leverage,to make jibraan do what they want. 
How can you be sure? 
'Cause that's what I would've done. 
Agent,it is imperative that we take this hostile alive. 
Right now,he's our only shot at finding out where this attack is going taking place. 
Understood.I've already informed my men. 
I want to run point on this.Is that all right? 
Thanks. 
You're going to stay here with the backup teams. 
Are you sure that's such a good idea? 
What? 
Agent bauer-- he doesn't seem to be too well. 
Maybe you should be in charge. 
I am. 
Jack was infected with the bioweapon. 
The same one that they are going to use in this attack. 
Then he should be in the hospital. 
There is no treatment.He probably has less than a dayo live. 
So if he is strong enough,trust me,he's the best person for this job. 
I'm sorry,I didn't realize. 
Agent walker,we're ready. 
Please,mr. Bauer,do what you can to save hamid. 
We've checked the windows.We have a clear approach. 
Let's go. 
Agents,stay with mr. Gohar. 
On my count. 
Three...two...one. 
Hamid,stop! 
Put it down.We're fbi.We need him alive. 
Put it down.He made my brother into a terrorist. 
Your brother is not a terrorist.He's innocent.We know that. 
He's being set up.He's being forced to do this. 
What? 
Please. 
The only one who can tell us where your brother is that man right there. 
Now put it down. 
Stand up now,put your hands behind your head. 
Do it! 
Agent walker,move in now. 
Damn it,he's bleeding out. 
We need a medic,now! 
We need a med team on site. 
Sit right there. 
Are you in their system? 
I've tapped into the main security trunk line, but I'm still looping in breakers to make sure the tap doesn't get flagged. 
All right,well,we're on a timetable here. 
How much longer is it going to take? 
Ten,maybe 15 minutes. 
Hand me that case. 
What are you going to have me do? 
You'll find out soon enough. 
Is the subway on schedule? 
Yeah,it's on schedule. 
Have you made the preparations? 
Are you sure you want to leave now, Colonel? 
Can't imagine GeneralJuma will be pleased... 
 to learn that you're abandoning your mission. 
 The mission is over. 
Do you think I'm a fool, Mr. Burnett? 
If anything should happen to me on my way out of the country... 
a data file with all the names and bank transactions of all those involved... 
will be sent to theJustice Department. 
When the car arrives, we would like you to go with the driver... 
so that we could follow you back to Dubaku. 
You want her to go to him and face him? 
It's the only chance we have of finding him before he disappears forever. 
 I'll do it. 
 You keep her safe, you hear me? 
We will. 
 Colonel! F.B.I. 
 Go! Go! 
I want the names of everyone in the United States government that you've been working with. 
I have a list. 
I found some kind of digital storage device... 
 implanted under Dubaku's skin. 
 Can you upload the files to F.B.I. 
Marika didn't make it. 
 You killed my sister! 
 I'm so sorry. 
 What do you want from me? 
 I just want to know that you feel something! 
I want to know that you feel the same kind of pain that I do! 
Do you feel that? 
I'm working with F.B.I. 
To coordinate an interagency sweep. 
We should start making arrests within the hour. 
What you have done here today puts all of us in your debt. 
There are a lot of people to thank, including Jack Bauer. 
What are you asking me to do, Bill? 
I'm asking you to speak to Senator Mayer. 
Jack Bauer helped save this country. 
He doesn't deserve to spend the rest of his life in prison. 
 I'm going to the White House. 
 Sir? 
President Taylor wants to speak to me regarding Jack Bauer. 
Grab your laptop, Ryan. 
I want you there with me. 
There's gonna be another attack, here in D.C. 
My source tells me that the window opens at 1900 hours. 
 What's the target? 
 He doesn't know the exact target. 
But it's definitely gonna be of high value and high impact. 
He gave me the name of somebody who's been involved in the planning. 
 Who? 
 Ryan Burnett. 
Senator Mayer's chief of staff? 
 That's right. 
   The following takes place between 6:00 p.m. And 7:00 p.m. 
Hold on a second. 
Go ahead. 
   I.C.U. One moment, please. 
 Karina, you got a call on three. 
 Who is it? 
Dr. May. He's got a question. 
Doctors are so helpless. Dr. May. 
Hello? 
   There was no one there. 
If he calls back, tell him I'll call him back in a minute. 
Code blue! Code blue! 
We have a code blue in the I.C.U. 
Get Agent Walker down to I.C.U., now! 
 Swift and decisive is how the Pentagon describes... 
the U.S. Invasion now underway in Sangala 
sporadic resistance, minimal casualties. 
This in direct contrast to assertions... 
made by Sangalese leader Benjamin Juma on state-supported television. 
Our brave soldiers are beating back the enemy... 
all across Sangala City. 
History is on our side, my friends. 
We survived their slave ships... 
and we will survive their warships too. 
Declaring victory while his own troops... 
are fleeing the capital and his palace lies in ruins. 
When do we think this was made? 
My guess is these recordings were made sometime before the invasion, ma'am. 
Which begs the question, John, where is he, and why haven't we found him yet? 
Special Forces teams all over Sangala City are searching for him. 
There's some intelligence to suggest he may have fled the country. 
Admiral Smith, you and I both know Juma must be captured. 
He must be tried and convicted of his crimes against humanity. 
Otherwise, we've as good as failed. 
He can't go far, ma'am. 
No country on earth will grant him asylum. 
Then find him, Admiral Smith, wherever he is. 
General Juma. 
Beautiful, isn't it? 
 Sir? 
 It's not a trick question, Laurent. 
It is beautiful. And why not? 
It is almost time. 
The men-Are they ready? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Are they afraid? 
I don't know, sir. 
But some of them are praying. 
It's good if they are afraid. 
It means they will fight bravely. 
Have you heard from my father yet, sir? 
I thought he was supposed to be meeting us here. 
Don't worry, Laurent. He'll be here. 
Yes, sir. 
   Yes? 
 Colonel Dubaku is dead. 
 Are you certain? 
The dose I administered was catastrophic. 
His son just asked me about him. 
He must never know about this or about his father's cowardice. 
 He won't. 
 Then nothing will stand in our way, Udo. 
But hurry. The attack window is narrowing. 
Our timing must be precise. 
  Clear. 
 Yes, sir. 
Clear. 
 One more time at 360. 
 360. You're charged. 
Clear. 
Nothing. Are you goin' again, Doctor? 
No. That's it, everybody. 
I'm calling it. 
Time of death: 6:06 p.m. 
 Dr. Scott, what's going on? 
 A massive heart attack. 
You said that he was stable, that he was gonna be okay. So what happened? 
I'm not sure. Maybe a preexisting condition. 
The autopsy will tell us. Excuse me. 
Dr. Scheinert, O.R. 3. 
The wide extent of the corruption requires a coordinated approach. 
We know the government's been compromised. 
We just don't know at what level. 
Presently, Chloe O'Brian is vetting the names, department by department. 
I'm prioritizing Secret Service so the president is secured as soon as possible. 
Team leaders will then receive their assignments Defense, Treasury, State, et cetera and make their arrests contemporaneously across the District. 
 Are there any questions? 
  All right, everyone has their assignments. 
Let's get goin'. 
 O'Brian. 
 Chloe, it's Jack. 
Have the names from Dubaku's database... 
 been handed over to the arrest teams yet? 
 Not yet. 
Okay, listen to me. I've just learned that 
Juma's operatives are planning another attack. 
Jack, they're telling us here it's over. 
 That's wrong. Tony's my source on the intel. 
 Do you know what the target is? 
Only that it's high value, high casualty, and that it's happening now... 
which is why I need your help. 
There's a name on the list- a Ryan Burnett. 
He's Senator Mayer's chief of staff. 
Mayer? Isn't he the guy who grilled you this 
morning at the Senate subcommittee hearing? 
Yeah. But the senator's not implicated 
in the conspiracy. 
But Burnett has been providing support forJuma and Dubaku all along. 
Chloe, I need you to delete his name from the list. 
 What? Why? 
 If the F.B.I. Start to move in on him... 
he'll lawyer up, and no one will get the information on time. 
 Where is he now? 
 He's at the White House with the senator. 
They've got a meeting with the president. 
I'm on my way there now to be debriefed by Bill. I'll take care of him then. 
Jack, you don't expect to interrogate a suspect in the White House? 
Let me handle that, Chloe. Just get his name 
deleted from the list. I'll get back to you. 
She's in. 
Hi. 
 How close are we? 
 Close. 
Is there anything I can do to help? 
I'm just cycling through the last layer of data now. 
You know, it might be quicker if you send the subsets to my station, one by one. 
 Good idea. 
 And then that way, I can get to work on distributing them. 
 Okay, then. 
 Thank you. 
 Listen, Jack, maybe you should reconsider. 
 Reconsider what? 
Taking Bill into your confidence. 
Look, I mean, he's been a part of this operation since the get-go. 
I don't know what it's gonna take to get Burnett to talk. 
If I have to use extreme measures I don't get it. 
What, you don't think he'll go there? 
I'm driving off a cliff here, Tony. 
I don't need to put Bill in the passenger seat. 
All right, then. Fine. 
I'll go with you. 
You're a wanted felon. 
You wouldn't get past the first checkpoint. 
Besides, with all of the government agencies still compromised... 
it might be up to you to stop the attack. 
See you on the other side. 
  Yes? 
 Can you extend the attack window? 
Not without risking the entire operation. 
 Why? 
 There's been a complication. 
I may be stuck here longer than I anticipated. 
I'll call you back. Mr. Kanin. 
Ryan Burnett, Senator Mayer's chief of staff. 
We've spoken on the phone. 
 Many times. Good to finally meet you. 
 Likewise. 
The senator's inside. Right this way. 
Senator? 
Well, Senator. I see you found the bar. 
Mind if I join you? 
   Something I never knew. 
If it ain't from Kentucky, you can't call it bourbon. 
Spare me the Southern gentleman routine, Ethan. 
The president didn't call me up at the ass end of the day to drink her booze... 
and flip through a briefing book. 
I thought it might be helpful before your meeting... 
to bring you up to speed on the events of the last 10 hours. 
Okay. I'm up to speed. 
Senator, surely you have some reaction to what you just read. 
Damn right I have a reaction. 
I want to know what all this has to do with Jack Bauer. 
I mean, that's the reason I'm here, right? 
Without Mr. Bauer, 
we would never have uncovered... 
the conspiracy in the first place, nor the people behind it. 
His efforts, in conjunction with those of the F.B. I... 
are largely responsible for the arrests being made right now across the District. 
You're not saying that he's acting in an official capacity? 
I don't have to tell you how this looks, Ethan. 
Colluding with a rogue operative from a disbanded agency? 
I'm sorry you see it that way. 
 How else am I supposed to see it? 
 The way the president does. 
ThatJack Bauer saved lives today, plain and simple... 
including her husband's. 
Look, Senator, I know this isn't easy for you. 
The public battle you've waged against detainee abuse and human rights violations Are you seriously asking me to look the other way on this? 
I have been after this son of a bitch for years. 
He's a thug, Ethan. 
He's exhibit "A." 
President's prepared to reverse policy... 
and support your amendment to the War Crimes Act. 
 In exchange for what, exactly? 
 The hearings. 
Declare a recess till after the holidays... 
and then quietly let Mr. Bauer's subpoena expire. 
And if I refuse to go along? 
The president is prepared to invoke executive privilege. 
"Executive privilege" meaning what exactly? 
Well, that's for the president to decide. 
Are you talking about a pardon? 
I wouldn't rule it out. 
Well, if that's how the president wants to play it... 
you can tell her she just walked into a street fight. 
You can tell her yourself. 
 Jack. 
 Hey, Bill. 
You got here sooner than I expected. 
 Jack! 
 Put down your weapon. Now! 
Step away from the desk! 
Take a seat. Sit down, Bill! 
Okay, okay, I'm sitting. 
Now what's this all about? 
 Where's Ryan Burnett? 
 What? 
Senator Mayer's chief of staff. 
Where is he? 
I'm not saying anything until you tell me what the hell's going on. 
Tony doubled back to one of his contacts, who gave him information of a second attack. 
It's gonna take place here in Washington within the hour. 
Juma's operatives are carrying it out. 
Burnett's been supporting them all along. 
He knows where the attack's gonna take place. 
So you can either tell me where he is, or I will find him myself. 
Jack, I can't. 
Fine. Put your hands behind your back, now! 
How good is the intel? 
Good enough for me to need to talk to him. 
Don't you move. 
Jack, let me have him arrested. 
 There are other ways to deal with this. 
  Attack window's open. 
We're outta time. 
Jack, listen to me. 
I spoke to the president on your behalf. 
She's gonna intervene with Senator Mayer, stop the hearings. 
You can get you life back. 
You do this, you're throwing it all away. 
I wish I thought there was another option. 
Let me help you at least, Jack. 
You don't have to do this alone. 
Yes, I do. 
It's the only way I can be sure to keep you out of this. 
 Jack  Bill, I'm sorry. 
 Jack, wait. 
 Don't move. 
Jack It's all right. Don't fight it. 
 This is Moss. 
  Larry, it's me. 
Dubaku's dead. 
I thought the doctor said he was stabilized. 
What happened? 
Officially, they're characterizing... 
that it was a coronary brought on by systemic shock. 
Sounds like you don't believe it. 
I did a follow-up with a hospital admin. 
She confirmed that there was an eight-member team on duty when Dubaku flatlined. 
 Yeah? 
 There was a ninth man in the I.C. U ... 
just before the code was called- an orderly. 
I ran back the tapes on the ward, and that's when I spotted him. 
Thing is, I've asked around, and nobody seems to know who he is. 
Renee, wait. Are you saying 
you think Dubaku was murdered? 
I'm saying that there was an unidentified man in with Dubaku... 
just before he went into cardiac arrest. 
 What does the admin say? 
 Well, she says that they often use floaters personnel from other area hospitals filling in from time to time. 
Said it's not uncommon for the regular staff not to know who they are. 
 She's doublechecking with payroll now. 
 So there's your answer. 
Yeah. But still, it seems odd. 
I mean, what if Dubaku knew something and they needed to shut him up? 
Is this Bauer's theory too? 
Jack's not even here. And, you know, 
I resent that implication, Larry. 
 What implication is that? 
 That I'm not the one calling the shots. 
This has been my investigation from the beginning, notJack Bauer's. 
I was just asking a question. 
I wasn't implying anything. 
You there? 
I'm sorry. I guess 
I'm a little sensitive on the subject. 
Look, everything we needed from Dubaku, we got names and bank accounts of every corrupt official on his payroll. 
Teams are in the field as we speak. 
So you're saying you want me to come in. 
We need you back in the office sooner than later to help process all these arrests. 
Larry, look. I've got security 
searching the hospital, reviewing more video. 
 So you wanna follow that up first? 
 Yeah. 
 Fine. Call me when you clear it. 
 I will. Thanks, Larry. 
Excuse me, Agent Walker? 
That orderly you were looking for One of our parking lot cameras picked him up getting into his car. 
 When? 
 Uh, about 15 minutes ago. 
I've got a screen grab of his license plate. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
This is Agent Walker. 
Put me through to our D.M.V. Contact. 
Are you busy? 
I'm just reformatting the server, so, yeah, I guess I am busy. Why? 
Well, I was cross-referencing Dubaku's offshore accounts... 
 and I came across an orphaned header fragment. 
 What are you talking about? 
Take a look. 
Okay. See? There it- Right there, right there. 
It's a remnant file header. 
It's probably just a phantom data string. 
No, it isn't. I ran a system analysis. 
The coding is not random. 
It can be traced back to one of the accounts. 
Also, it looks like a name was deleted from the list. 
 Why don't I run a recovery program? 
 Well, you're very busy... 
with the reformatting and all. 
So why don't I just upload it to my station and take care of it there? 
Oh, that's okay. I can do it faster. 
No offense. L 
I'll let you know if I retrieve anything. 
Sure. 
 Thanks. 
 Thank you. 
   Yeah. 
Have you gotten to Burnett yet? 
Working on it. 
Making my way over to the West Wing. 
Someone here has figured out that a name's been deleted from the database. 
I don't know how much longer I can hold her off. 
 Do they know it was Burnett? 
 No. But it's just a matter of time. 
Okay. I'll get back to you. 
Great. 
Senator, I'll head back to the Hill and get with Sandy. 
Should have a press release drafted by the time you finish your meeting. 
I'm also gonna need a sit-down with your friend Hauser at the Post. 
Off the record, I assume? 
We've gotta make pardoning Jack Bauer as politically toxic for the president as possible. 
She's a woman in a highly emotional state. 
Her husband's been shot. 
You suggesting her judgment's impaired? 
 I'm suggesting that a case could be made. 
  Excuse me, Senator. 
President Taylor's ready to see you now. 
Go ahead, Senator. I'll get this to the A.G., 
tell him you want the option... 
 to go ahead with the hearings tomorrow as scheduled. 
 Thanks, Ryan. 
  Yes? 
 It's Burnett. 
 You took care of the problem? 
 I'm leaving now. 
 Good. Then we rendezvous 
at 2130 hours as planned. 
 I'll be there. 
Excuse me. 
I'll be out ofhere in just one second. 
 You and l   We're gonna have a talk. 
We've got a command post set up at E.E.O.B. 
And we'll brief C.I.A. And diplomatic security. 
 But not until after the first sweep of arrests. 
  I understand, but Look, nobody is going anywhere, Phil. 
We've dropped a net on the city. 
And I'll let you know as soon as that happens. 
 Thank you. 
 All right. Yeah. 
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need you to listen to something. May I? 
Yeah, that's fine. 
She's supposed to be this whiz-bang systems analyst... 
which is actually what tipped me off in the first place. 
 And her demeanor is so  Whoa, whoa. Janis. Slow down. 
Who you talking about? 
Chloe O'Brian. 
I ran a systems check on her work... 
and it turns out there's evidence of file tampering. 
Plus, she's been scrambling all her out-of-office phone calls. 
So I had Operations archive her cellular traffic. 
I did a work-around. Listen. 
  Yeah? 
  Have you gotten to Burnett yet? 
 Working on it. 
Making my way over to the West Wing. 
 Someone here has figured out that a name's been deleted from the database. 
 I don't know how much longer I can hold her off  Do they know it was Burnett? 
No. But it's just a matter of time. 
Okay. I'll get back to you. 
 Becker. 
 Yes, sir. 
In the conference room. 
I want Chloe O'Brian detained. 
 And get her off that server. 
 Yes, sir. 
Ms. O'Brian? 
You need to come with me. 
 Get me the White House. 
  Right away. 
Let me just remind you, Madam President... 
you supported the effort to ban abuse and torture. 
You campaigned to reform the intelligence agencies. 
These past 10 hours, Senator... 
things haven't appeared as black-and-white as they once did. 
Well, there's nothing gray aboutJack Bauer. 
The man has committed atrocities. 
Prisoners have died in his custody. 
Mr. Bauer has served under the aegis 
of three presidents, not just me. 
Is it any more lawful or any less repugnant if it's authorized at the highest level? 
A state of war is not a blank check for the president or for anyone. 
Oh, don't lecture me, Senator. 
I am well aware of the limits of my power. 
Due respect, Madam President, your power is great. 
Just be careful that you use it to send the right message. 
All I'm asking you to do is excuse Mr. Bauer as a witness. 
It's not a message. It is an expression 
of gratitude for what he's done today. 
You're asking me to excuse him as a target of the investigation. 
And the message is clear. 
Under certain circumstances, you believe his methods are acceptable. 
Some would argue that they are. 
And they would be wrong under any military or moral standard. 
America has been down this road before, Madam President. 
You yourself called it a national tragedy. 
It was a tragedy. I still believe that. 
Pardon Jack Bauer, and you're telling every interrogator in the field... 
that it's open season again. 
I'm sorry to interrupt, Madam President. 
There's an urgent call from Larry Moss at F.B.I. 
 Put him through. 
 Yes, sir. 
Agent Moss is on the line. 
Agent Moss, this is Ethan Kanin. 
You're on speaker with the president. 
 Madam President, forgive me for coming directly to the point. 
You have a meeting this evening with Senator Mayer? 
In fact, I do. I'm with him right now. 
Did the senator's chief of staff Ryan Burnett... 
accompany the senator to the White House? 
 Yes, he did, Agent Moss. Why? 
 I have reason to believe... 
thatJack Bauer is carrying out an off-book interrogation of Mr. Burnett as we speak. 
    I can pull the trigger 128 more times before this battery dies. 
I'm telling you, I don't know anything about an attack. 
 Stop lying to me. 
 I'm not lying. 
 What's the target? 
 I can't tell you what I don't know. 
 Mr. Burnett, you are 
a traitor and a terrorist. 
 I'm not. 
 I love my country. 
  That was 1,200 volts of current. Now... 
when I eject this cartridge, I access the drive stun mode... 
upping the voltage 40 times when directly administered. 
 No. Don't. 
 All you need to do is talk to me. 
Mr. Burnett, it's really simple. Just tell me 
what the target is, and this will all be over. 
I promise, I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 This is your last chance. 
 If I knew, I would tell you, I swear. 
What do you want me to say? 
Just-Just tell me what to say. I'll say it. 
    Don't you even try and play that game with me. 
Mr. Burnett, I've been doin' this a long time, 
and I can tell the difference... 
especially when a man is under duress, if he's got information that I need... 
or if I'm just wasting my time. 
And I promise you, I am not wasting my time. 
The next jolt is gonna be in your throat. 
Anything above your neck runs the risk of a complete neuromuscular shutdown. 
 That means you run the risk ofbecoming paralyzed. 
 No, please. 
Mr. Burnett, you built 
the entire federal case against me. 
You, of all people, should know how far I am willing to go... 
to stop this attack from happening. 
So I'm gonna ask you one last time. 
Where is the target? 
Ll Okay, okay, okay. 
 I'm listening. 
 Soldiers. 
 How many? 
 A unit. 
 Juma's presidential guard. 
 When? 
It already started. 
 Where? Where? 
  Mr. Bauer, this is President Taylor. 
 Where's the target? 
 Mr. Bauer? 
 Where? 
 Mr. Bauer, I am ordering you 
to answer this page. 
 Mr. Bauer, do you hear me? 
 Damn it! 
Madam President, this is Jack Bauer. 
I don't know what you've heard so far, but this thing is not over. 
There is another terrorist attack going to take place within minutes. 
There will be no discussion until you unlock this door. 
Madam President, the attack window is open. 
Juma's men are moving. 
What you're doing is against the law, Mr. Bauer. 
I am your commander in chief, and I am ordering you to stand down. 
Mr. Bauer 
 How much longer, Sergeant? 
 Good to go, ma'am. 
 Do it. 
 Where's the target? Where is the target? 
Where is I had him! 
    Man down. 
E.M.T.'s to the Visiting Dignitaries Suite. 
You're done, Bauer. You're finished. 
He was talking. 
Whatever's gonna happen is happening now... 
and it's on your conscience. 
My conscience has a lot less to answer for than yours. 
Mr. Bauer, you say an attack is imminent. 
My source intel is good. 
 Who's your source? 
 I'd rather not say. 
The name, Mr. Bauer. 
 Tony Almeida. 
 Tony Almeida? The man's a fugitive. 
Without Tony Almeida, we would never have recovered the C.I.P. Device. 
Madam President, I don't care ifhis source is the Blessed Virgin Mary. 
Nothing justifies what went on in this room. 
Even if he's right, Blaine? 
Even if it means we could save lives? 
Look at that and tell me it's not barbarism. 
Is that something you can live with? 
Earlier today, Madam President, two airplanes were brought down. 
Is that something you can live with? 
 You're reprehensible, Bauer. 
 And you, sir, are weak! 
Unwilling and unable to look evil in the eye and deal with it! 
Ethan, step out for a second. 
Suddenly, it's not so hypothetical, is it? 
In your opinion, is Bauer's intelligence actionable? 
Bauer says there's gonna be an attack, my belief is there's going to be an attack. 
Torture was originally intended to force false confessions. 
Now we use it to try and find the truth. 
These people murdered your son, Madam President. 
They attempted to murder your husband. 
They will stop at nothing. 
Sergeant, take Mr. Bauer away. 
He's under arrest. 
You should have come to me. 
You should have presented your case. 
We didn't have time. 
And would it really have made a difference, ma'am? 
Madam President, you're doing the right thing. 
271 dead already. I wish to God 
it felt more like the right thing. 
Ethan, raise the threat levels. 
Tell Homeland... 
they have until 7:00 to come up with a response scenario. 
And get Tim down here. 
Also, I want to talk to Mr. Burnett myself. 
Let me do that. I know the man. 
Apparently, you don't. 
Got it. 
Tim. I understand 
the threat level's been raised... 
but only for first responders and federal agencies. 
There's a concern that mass evacuation by the public... 
could hamper efforts to thwart an attack when it comes. 
 What about the airspace over Washington? 
 Restricted. 
Military flyovers are commencing. 
D.O.D. Has recommended 
that we deploy mobile teams... 
to sweep the area for radioactive and biological signatures. 
Call Philip at the Pentagon and push it through. What about N.S.A. 
There's elevated anti-American chatter coming from the usual Web sites and telephone traffic. 
 But nothing specific to the attack. 
 Thank you, Tim. 
 See you upstairs in 15 minutes? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
Which means our best source of intelligence is still right here under our noses. 
You realize we're gonna have to offer this bastard a free pass. 
With coercive measures off the table, it's our only option. 
Bauer's going to prison, and a traitor walks. 
What's wrong with this picture? 
I need a minute with the prisoner. 
Mr. Burnett, 
you will be charged with treason... 
under Title 18, Section 2381 of the United States Code: Giving aid and comfort to the enemy and directly causing the death of American citizens. 
Do you understand? 
Surely you have something to say for yourself. 
I demand my right to counsel. 
You'll have your counsel, Mr. Burnett. 
But first, you're going to tell me everything you know. 
Not in this lifetime. 
 What did you say? 
 I said not in this lifetime. 
Don't be so quick to make up your mind, Mr. Burnett. 
In exchange for information which stops or significantly mitigates this attack... 
president is prepared to grant you full immunity from prosecution. 
I'm sorry. I can't help you. 
If you and your family are being threatened in any way Do you realize what the president is offering you? 
Treason is a capital offense, Mr. Burnett. 
If you don't cooperate with us right now, I will make it my personal mission... 
to see that you pay the ultimate price for your crimes. 
I won't condone torture. 
But in your case, I would have no problem with the death penalty. 
Where's my lawyer? 
 Walker. 
  It's me. 
That situation at the hospital you told me about I'm on it, Larry. 
 I traced the license plate to an import-export firm. 
 Tell me. 
The orderly I mentioned, he just joined up with about a dozen soldiers. 
 Africans, heavily armed. 
 Where are you? 
44543 Lamborn Marina, nearJohnson Park. 
I'm in the warehouse basement. 
Renee, we have intel on another attack byJuma's people. 
It's happening in D.C. 
Sometime after 1900 hours. 
 This is it, Larry. No question. 
 All right, listen. Sit tight. 
I'm on my way with backup. 
Janis, scramble a chopper. 
On the roof in two minutes. 
 Okay. But also, there's 
 Janis, just do it. 
 This is Larry Moss. 
Put me through to Metro Police. 
  Yes, sir. 
 Charters, Turner, with me. 
 Yes, sir. 
General, there is no sign of my father. 
I just spoke with him. 
Unfortunately, he won't be able to join us. 
 Why not? 
 Because he got delayed... 
in his attempt to secure safe passage for us from the country. 
Then, sir, let me take his place on the assault team. 
Spoken like a true Dubaku, Laurent. 
But you also are my only reconnaissance officer. 
 But General  No, I need you on the perimeter to provide intelligence. 
Also, to disrupt whatever rescue operations there may be. 
Understood? 
Understood, sir. 
 Make your final preparations. 
It is time for us to go. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Yeah? 
  Larry, hurry. They're moving out. 
 We're 10 minutes away. 
 Is it possibleJuma himself is leading this attack? 
Juma? Why do you say that? 
I know it sounds crazy, but I swear that I just saw him. 
What? Here? Are you sure? 
 Unless he has an identical twin. 
 All right, I'll alert Homeland. 
Good work. Any idea what the next target is? 
 Negative. 
 See if you can get a fix on that. 
But listen. Don't take any chances, all right? 
I won't. 
  They're running a check now, sir. 
 Okay, thank you. 
Sir, you should have an E.M.T. 
Take a look at you. 
I'm fine. Is Bauer in custody? 
 Yes, sir. He's in holding. 
 That'll be all. 
 Tony, it's Bill. 
 Bill. 
Jack's under arrest. They've got him 
locked down in a holding cell here. 
 Listen to me, Bill. 
 No, you listen. 
 We still don't know where this attack's taking place. 
 Burnett didn't break? 
No. They stopped Jack before 
he could get the information. 
And Burnett didn't go for the president's immunity deal. 
 You were the one who brought Jack the intel, right? 
 That's right. 
 How real is it? 
 Very. 
Who was your contact? 
He was a guy in Emerson's crew with a direct line toJuma. 
Any chance we get another crack at this guy? 
That's highly unlikely, to say the least. 
 What are you telling me? He's dead? 
 That's right. 
I wish to God you'd brought me in on this. 
Jack didn't wanna put you in that position. 
For what it's worth, he was trying to protect you, Bill. 
Did you have a fallback plan, at least? 
Immunity for Burnett was the fallback. 
That's it? Nothing else? 
No. Nothing. 
I keep trying Renee. 
I keep getting her voice mail. 
 What the hell's goin' on? 
 There's something wrong with her phone. 
What do you mean, something's wrong? 
I spoke to her five minutes ago. 
Can you triangulate her position? 
 I can't. 
 Why not? 
There's no signal. Either the battery's dead, 
or her cell got damaged somehow. 
All right, keep trying. 
Get back to me when you know something. 
Okay. 
From our location, it is approximately 100 meters to the entrance. 
From this point forward... 
we maintain radio silence until target is secured. 
 Understood? 
  Yes, sir. 
You all have your assignments. 
May God be with us. 
Laurent. Take your position. 
Yes, sir. 
Livy, it could take weeks to find Ethan's replacement. 
In the meantime, I'm going to need a provisional chief of staff. 
I would like that to be you. 
I have Larry Moss calling for you. 
Ma'am, we have evidence Juma allowed Starkwood to use Sangala as a base to manufacture biological weapons. 
Are you saying these weapons are on US soil? 
We suspect they're at the Starkwood headquarters in Virginia. 
And you're not suggesting that Starkwood intends to use those weapons to attack this country? 
Given their actions today, we need to move on Starkwood immediately. 
They're coming and they'll be coming with everything they've got and the only thing that's going to stop them is getting these weapons ready to deploy. 
Tell me what the FBI knows. 
I don't know anything, Mr. Hodges. 
Get him out of here and do what you have to do. 
I'm not spending the rest of my life in prison because Jonas Hodges has lost his mind. 
You know where the weapons are? 
Yes. 
Where's Jack? 
He managed to secure the weapons, but Starkwood got him back. 
Jack was exposed. 
There has to be something that you can do to help him. 
There's no cure. 
We got a location on the weapon. 
nt to go. 
I'm sorry. 
I can't allow it. 
I'm the only one who's seen the canisters. 
I know exactly what we're looking for. 
But you're sick. 
We have no idea when you're going to start showing symptoms. 
You're right. 
Where are the damn weapons?! 
He played me. 
Little old Seaton bought us some time. 
We're going to do a point by point search of this entire compound. 
There are biological weapons on this facility. 
We're not going anywhere without them. 
You try to advance any farther, you will be fired upon. 
I count three platoons at least. 
Everything mil-spec. 
Yeah. They were 
waiting for us. 
This was one big trap. 
Renee, we would really use those satellite overheads. 
Copy, Larry. 
What have we got? 
Nothing. 
The subnet's been crashing. 
Okay, wait, wait, wait. 
Here we go. 
I've got sat five retasking now... 
Somebody talk to me. 
What are you seeing? 
Larry, you've got hostiles on all sides. 
Damn it. Find 
me an opening. 
I'm looking, but there's no way through. 
Okay, heads up. 
Is everybody seeing this? 
Larry? 
Yeah. 
Yeah. we're seeing it. 
It's Hodges. 
The men are at the ready, sir. 
I appreciate your presence. 
Where else would I be? 
Who's in charge here? 
I am. 
Agent Moss. 
You need to move your men and allow us to proceed. 
I want you off our property and I want you to release my man. 
You have no right to take him hostage. 
I have an order from the President of the United States. 
To search this building. 
For weapons that do not exist. 
Have you looked? 
Are there weapons of mass destruction? 
Are there weapons of any kind? 
Is there anything in here at all?! 
Agent Moss, who dreamed up this charade? 
Give me a name. 
Let's get to the bottom of this. 
You want to talk to me, Mr. Hodges? 
Get these guns off my head. 
You think you have a gun at your head? 
You know what I've got? 
I've got the United States government sending SWAT teams and attack helicopters in the middle of the night. 
I've got a government that I served faithfully for 30 years dreaming up BS accusations so politicians too cowardly to show their faces can dismantle my company. 
That's what I've got. 
You've got five minutes to get these-these helicopters flying out of here with all of you on board. 
You don't want to do this. 
Five minutes. 
And I want my man back. 
Renee, you get that? 
Yeah, we did. 
And what options do we have? 
In five minutes? 
I know there's no time to bring in more TAC support, so give me something else. 
All right, Larry, give me a second. Stand by. 
That's it. 
I want to show you something. 
Hodges just gave us five minutes to clear the base. 
We lost that situation. 
We were outmaneuvered but I think I found us a new way in. 
Look. These are 
Senator Mayer's files. 
This is Douglas Knowles. 
He's the chairman of Starkwood. 
He was actually helping the senator with the investigation. 
He is the one who brokered the deal to open the company's books. 
What, another insider? 
Didn't we just get burned? 
Just listen. 
Knowles was loyal to Hodges for almost 20 years and now he's secretly helping the senator take down Starkwood? 
He's scared of something. 
This man wants to help us. 
It's worth a shot. 
Yeah. Make the call. 
Knowles. 
Mr. Knowles, 
my name is Jack Bauer. 
I got your number from Senator Mayer. 
Senator Mayer is dead. 
Yes, sir, I know. I was 
with him when he was killed by one of your employees. 
A man named John Quinn. 
You have no idea how much I was hoping someone would call. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
I don't understand. 
Things are very out of control. 
Are you aware of what's happening on your base? 
I'm watching it with my own eyes. 
The FBI is pinned down. 
They say they're looking for bioweapons. 
Sir, Jonas Hodges is in possession of a military-grade bioweapon. 
A prion variant developed in Africa with General Juma. 
Well, it's not where they think it is. 
They're all standing in front of an empty hangar. 
The FBI was deliberately led to the wrong location by a man named Seaton, but I promise you, sir, the weapon is on your base. 
I was contaminated when trying to intercept the canisters. 
They were ferried back to Starkwood approximately 90 minutes ago. 
90 minutes ago Jonas was handing down his new strategy to the board. 
Stonewall the government, no cooperation whatsoever. 
I can't believe this is happening. 
Sir, this is happening and I promise you the weapons are on your base. 
Do you have any idea where they might be? 
I think I might. 
Mr. Knowles, I want 
to put you in touch with one of my men in the field. 
Can I call you right back? 
Yes. 
Thank you. Go. 
Some of the men were unhappy drawing down on federal agents. 
It's understandable. 
I had hoped not to include the rank and file. 
You can count on them. 
Let's show our guests the door. 
Let's move! 
Into position. 
Jack, I'm on comm. 
You're on with me and Agent Walker. 
Hodges' men have repositioned themselves. 
Okay, we're going to have to move fast. 
Larry, I want you and your men to pull out on Hodges' timetable. 
Tony, you're going to need to find a way to stay behind. 
We're going to get your vectors over to a man that we contacted inside Starkwood. 
His name is Douglas Knowles. 
He believes he knows where the weapons are. 
Isn't this how we got into this mess? 
Almeida and some supposedly friendly contact? 
Knowles is chairman of the Starkwood board, but he was cooperating with Senator Mayer's investigation of the company. 
Larry, he is all that we've got. 
All right, I got 400 eyeballs trained on me right now. 
How the hell are we supposed to get Almeida to stay behind? 
Larry, I need you and your men to create a diversion to cover Tony's escape. 
Look, we need to make this work. 
If you all get on those helicopters together, we are going to lose this weapon for good. 
Larry, are you on board with this? 
We got to go. 
Larry, we need to know, are you on board? 
I'll do what I can. 
Take his bag. 
All right, let's go. 
We're standing down. 
You're coming with me. 
Hey, wait a minute. 
This wasn't part of the deal. 
What deal? As far as I could 
tell, he couldn't care about you one way or the other. 
Moss. 
You take these handcuffs off of me or it's going to get really ugly. 
Soldier! 
Get the hell out of here, Moss. 
You don't want to test us. 
Let's go! 
Don't move. No! 
Doug Knowles. 
Jack Bauer sent me. 
Come on. 
That street's solid security cameras. 
I'll take you to a restricted area. 
It's on the east perimeter. 
There's a good chance the weapons are there. 
The place is crawling. 
I don't know how we're going to make it. 
I'll take care of that. 
Jack, I'm with Knowles. 
I'm going to need satellite support on the east perimeter. 
Jack, I need support. 
Do you copy? 
Copy, Tony. 
I've got you just off the landing pad. 
No hostiles in your immediate vicinity. 
Proceed at your own discretion. 
Copy that. 
Which way? 
Come on. 
Jack. 
You all right? 
Yeah, I'm fine. 
Tony and Knowles have connected. 
We're good. 
It's time to call the White House with an update. 
Okay, good. 
I'll be right there. 
Madam President, excuse the interruption. 
Jack Bauer is on line seven. 
Mr. Bauer, tell me you 
have the bioweapon. 
Madam President, I'm afraid that's not the case. 
Our search was stopped by armed mercenaries on Starkwood's base. 
Agent Moss and his men were forced to withdraw from a firefight they most certainly would have lost. 
Are you saying Hodges men were ready to fire on federal agents? 
Yes, ma'am, that's correct. 
My God! 
Who does he think he is?! 
Madam President, despite the setback, I am confident the weapons are still there. 
I reached out to Starkwood's chairman. 
He's willing to cooperate. 
He's with Tony Alameida now. 
They are moving towards a secure area on the base where we believe the weapons are being held. 
Very good. 
Tim, what's our troop status? 
Mobilizing. 
The Secretary of Defense says they're still several hours out. 
At which point we have a war on our hands against 1,500 mercenaries armed with bioweapons. 
Madam President, I do believe that a surgical air strike will work as long as we can pinpoint the exact location of the weapon. 
And you can do that? 
Yes, I believe we can. 
Mr. Bauer, 
you've seen the canisters containing the bioweapons, you know what they look like, is that correct? 
Yes, ma'am. 
Then we'll need you to verify the canisters once Almeida has located them. 
No more mistakes. 
We're gonna need visual confirmation from you, Bauer-- eyes on. 
Jack, we have got to get this part right. 
I understand. 
Anything else? 
Jack, I have been told that you were exposed to the pathogen. 
How you doing? 
Right now I'm fine, Madam President. 
Thank you for asking. 
Thank you for your service. 
I'm not giving up on you. 
Keep me informed. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Let's go. 
I don't have a lot of time. 
What's going on? 
That's what I've been trying to ask you. 
I called three times. 
It's kind of crazy here right now. 
Unless it's urgent, I gotta call you back. 
I'm hearing rumors that the Joint Chiefs have been called in. 
It's not a big deal. 
They're just doing a final assessment before lowering the alert level. 
Olivia, don't do this. 
What? 
I'm telling you the truth. 
Really? 
Because I've got a source in the Port Authority container yard who's using terms like "weapons of mass destruction," so naturally I'm wondering if that's why the Joint Chiefs are having a meeting. 
Look, I can't talk about it. 
It's obviously a question of national security. 
But you have my word I'll tell you soon as I can. 
I want to know now. 
I just gave you a big story, Ken. 
You'll have to wait. 
I gotta go. 
Don't hang up on me, Olivia. 
That'd be a big mistake. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
You want me to say it, fine, I'll say it. 
Think how your mother would feel when she hears that you forced out her chief of staff so you could take over his position. 
He was incompetent. 
Yeah, well, it won't play that way on the morning news. 
So, talk to me. 
Now. 
I can't talk here. 
I'm in the Roosevelt Continental, room 1271. 
You've got half an hour. 
Agent Pierce, please get a car ready. 
I have to make a quick run. 
All right, Jack, we're here. 
Knowles says there's been increased activity in this area for several days now. 
I'm looking at about a half a dozen buildings. 
Could be any one of them. 
Copy that, Tony. 
Hold on, we're getting infrared up now. 
I'm counting seven buildings in your immediate vicinity. 
The building directly southeast of your current position is showing no infrared signal. 
I'm guessing they're using a blackout shield. 
All right, we'll try there first. 
You see any patrols coming our way? 
Negative, you're clear. 
Okay, let's go. 
Jack, Knowles' key card isn't working. 
We're gonna need electronic support here. 
There should be an R-6 interface module on the back of your comm device. 
It's a card key. 
Yeah, I know what that is, thank you. 
I'm plugging in now. 
Okay, we're up. 
Cormac Z series. 
We're looking at a five digit key protected by an AES block cipher. 
Running combinations. 
Okay, Tony, you've got a vehicle coming your way. 
It's east of you about a hundred yards. 
Take cover down there. 
How much longer? 
How much more time do you need? 
I only have two out of five digits. 
We're pretty exposed here. 
Jack? 
It's all right, I'm fine. 
Come on. 
Two more numbers, Tony. 
What are we gonna do? 
We still got two digits to go. 
Move in for a closer look. 
Sit tight. 
Doug, where you-- Doug! 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
Hold your position. 
May I see some ID? 
Doug Knowles. 
One to go. 
I apologize, Mr. Knowles. 
Mr. Hodges has ordered the base 
cleared of all nonessential personnel. 
Nonessential personnel? 
I'm chairman of the board. 
I realize that, but we're dealing with a heightened security situation here. 
So, I need to know what you were doing in this area. 
Jonas called a late night board meeting, that's what I'm doing here. 
Sir, that meeting ended nearly  two hours ago. 
 We got it; we're in. 
I don't have to explain myself to you, you know. 
I'm sorry, sir, but you do. 
Sir, I don't believe you're hearing me. 
No, I don't you're hearing me! 
Look, I built this company! 
And I don't need you telling me where I can and cannot walk! 
Understood?! 
You're gonna have to come with me, sir. 
Right this way. 
I'm in. 
But they got Knowles. 
Do you think he's gonna say anything? 
I don't know. 
But I better get in and out as fast as possible just in case he does. 
Okay, Tony, the president needs a visual on the weapons before she'll launch an attack. 
She needs your eyes on the canisters and a confirmation by Jack. 
Copy that. 
I'm moving. 
Good. 
Jack? 
Stay here, I'll be right back. 
Jack! Jack?! 
We need a medic! Jack! 
Jack?! 
Jack? 
Get me the medic! 
We just found Mr. Knowles alone 
just outside the restricted zone. 
Did he have an explanation? 
Yes, sir, he said he was walking. 
Walking. 
Should I take him to Stokes for interrogation, sir? 
You're suggesting what, soldier, that we strap him down, extract a confession, because he was walking? 
He's the chairman of the board. 
I was just requesting instructions, sir. 
What you'd like done. 
I'd like you to take him to his office. 
Make sure he's comfortable. 
And stay with him until I arrive. 
Yes, sir. 
Will that be all? 
Call zone nine, have them double down security. 
Let's make sure that Mr. Knowles was in fact alone. 
Yes, sir. 
How much longer? 
Half an hour. 
Good. 
I'll need to know the minute it's done. 
Yes, sir. 
Aaron, I'd like you to wait in the hall, if that's okay. 
Ms. Taylor, you tasked me 
with handling your security. 
I can't allow you to enter a hotel room I haven't vetted. 
Aaron, I appreciate the concern. 
But you can see the door from here, I have you on speed-dial, and I can scream very loudly when the occasion demands. 
I just need two minutes to wrangle a reporter. 
Really, I'll be fine. 
All right, I'll be here if you need me. 
Want a drink? 
No. 
I assume you don't mind if I do. 
It's been a day. 
I gotta tell you. 
I don't like being threatened. 
It was unfortunate. 
I apologize. 
We've known each other a long time, Ken. 
I thought we had an understanding. 
We do. 
And I want to keep it that way. 
We both do. 
Am I right? 
Okay, so, I told you, I have this source. 
Cop out at the Port Authority container yard. 
Okay. 
He told me he saw these professional assassin types get into an intense firefight out there a couple hours ago. 
According to him, someone hijacked a WMD out to God knows where. 
That's true. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, I want to know all about it. 
Look, if you think all you've got to do is nod your head confirming what I already know, then we've got a problem. 
It's national security, Ken. 
I can't tell you. 
I'm saying you can. 
If this story breaks, it would create a panic. 
People would be hurt. 
If you knew what it was, you'd understand why it's got to stay a secret. 
Right, exactly. 
I'd understand. 
Have a little faith, okay? 
All right. There is a bioweapon 
in the container yard. 
That's what they were fighting over. 
It was developed by Starkwood in Africa. 
Starkwood? 
Right. 
They moved it to their base about 30 miles from here. 
So it's there right now. 
So this is what the Joint Chiefs are discussing, what to do about that. 
Olivia... 
The president ordered an air strike as soon as the exact location of the canisters was known. 
So you see why you can't run with this? 
Really, Ken, you can't. 
A lot of lives are at stake. 
The entire plan depends on surprise. 
You get that, right? 
Maybe you're right. 
Maybe I need to kill this story. 
Thank you. 
What I mean is maybe somebody could convince me. 
What are you saying? 
You know what I'm saying. 
You're very beautiful when you get all patriotic. 
I ever tell you that? 
That's over. We agreed. 
You agreed. 
Really, I don't want to do this. 
Ken... 
Then say no. 
Here, apply pressure. 
You can give yourself an injection once every two hours. 
More if needed. 
You think I'll need more? 
In all likelihood, yes. 
The onset of symptoms so soon after exposure suggests the bio-agent is more virulent than we thought. 
All we're doing here is just masking the symptoms. 
I understand. 
There's something you may want to consider, though. 
What's that? 
Bryden University has been funding some studies on prion diseases. 
The work is purely experimental at this point, but it does suggest treatment. 
That's good news. 
I don't want to get anyone's hopes up here. 
We're talking a slight chance. 
A possible treatment using stem cells from a genetically compatible donor. 
An immediate family member would make the best donor candidate. 
I saw your file. 
It says you have a daughter, right? 
I don't want my daughter involved in this. 
Jack, if there's a chance. 
Mr. Bauer... 
Doctor, thank you for everything you've done. 
Excuse me. 
I need to get back to work. 
Jack... 
This is none of your business. 
It's my business when you're having a seizure in the middle of the FBI. 
You heard the doctor. 
The medication will mask the symptoms. 
Why won't you even talk about this? 
Talk about what? 
The experimental procedure. 
Because there's nothing to talk about. 
She's your daughter, and you're not even gonna let her know? 
That's right. 
So you're just not even gonna try? 
Renee, I know you're trying to help, but you don't know what you're talking about here. 
My daughter and I, we don't talk, okay? 
So, please, just let it go. 
It should be her choice. 
Well, it's not. 
I'm the one who's dying. 
It's my choice. 
No sign of the target yet, but Tony's working on it. 
You look better. 
Thanks. 
Tony, can you hear me? 
Jack, you okay? 
Yeah, I'm fine. 
Okay, Tony, we're seeing new activity outside the building. 
Two vehicles, eight hostiles. 
Looks like a security detail. 
You think Knowles gave him up? 
Tony, they're moving straight for your point of entry. 
Eight hostiles and closing. 
Yeah, I hear them. 
You want to regroup? 
No, I want to get this over with. 
Right there. 
Two three, we're clear. 
I haven't seen you here before. 
They just sent eight of us over here, sir. 
Why, is something wrong? 
No, sir. 
Just, you know, precautions. 
Right, right. 
Can't be paranoid enough. 
I'm in the main building. 
Copy, we're with you. 
Tony, it's Jack. 
I've got you at 125 feet MSL, approximately 40 feet underground. Is that correct? 
That's right. 
I'm four floors down. 
We've got no information on any kind of subterranean floors for that building. 
Believe me, they're here. 
Epoxy-hardened walls, poured concrete ceilings. 
I have a visual on the weapon. 
Sending images for verification now. 
Copy that. 
Okay, those are the canisters. 
I'll notify Admiral Smith the target is located and confirmed. 
Tony, those are the canisters. 
Jack, it looks like they're transferring the pathogens from the canisters into some sort of delivery system. 
It's on the move. 
Copy that. 
It doesn't matter. 
Renee's phoning in the coordinates. 
Everything's gonna be dust in the next ten minutes. 
Get out of there now. 
Copy that. 
Withdrawing. 
Okay, men. 
You want to explain this, Jonas? 
I'm arrested by our own security force. 
Held captive in my own office like a prisoner. 
They won't allow me a phone call, even to you, to find out what the hell is going on! 
Well, that's a lot of complaints, Doug. 
You done? 
You were supposed to be home hours ago. 
Why'd they find you snooping around? 
I saw the FBI raid. 
They say we have bioweapons. 
Which they did not find. 
That's not the point. 
Is it true? 
Remember when I first brought you out here 20 years ago? 
There was nothing here. 
Nothing. 
And out of the damn mud, we built this place, the largest private army in the hemisphere, maybe the world, and we pulled America's ass out of the fire again and again and again. 
Answer the question! 
I am. 
Every day, we've done things that the government itself could not or would not do. 
"Get this done," that's what they said, "Here's your mission." 
Nobody asked how anything was gonna be done. 
Nobody wanted to know. 
All anyone wanted was results, and we delivered. 
No one's questioning that. 
No one's questioning that? 
You're not insane, are you? 
The senate, the committees, the president. 
Every chattering nonentity in Washington is out there with their standard operating procedures saying, "How was this done? 
How was that done?" 
Tearing at us, trying to bring us down, every one of them. 
I kept this country strong. 
I kept it safe. 
And I will not be persecuted for that. 
Jonas, you cannot start a war against the people you're supposed to protect. 
We were at war, Doug, the moment they decided to dismantle us. 
And as for particular weapons, as for your question, let me rephrase it. 
Are we prepared to defend ourselves? 
We are. 
Jonas... 
you can't take on the federal government. 
Yeah, well, you never were one for thinking big. 
20 years I treated you like a son. 
20 years. 
A little loyalty... 
wasn't that the least I deserved? 
Yes. 
Sir, we just got an alert from one of our radar intercepts. 
There's a squadron of F-18's heading our way out of Virginia Beach. 
Sir? 
What's the ETA? 
Less than ten minutes. 
What's our readiness? 
How many? 
We have three loaded. 
Place the call to the president. 
I'll be there momentarily. 
You probably think I'm the scum of the earth right now. 
All I care about is that you don't run the Starkwood story. 
You're a real sport. 
Taking one for the team like this. 
Look at me. 
You won't run it, right? 
I'm sorry, Livy. 
What? 
Breaking something this big will put me over the top in New York. 
I'll make sure nobody knows any of it came from you. 
You lying son of a bitch. 
Come on, please. 
I'm did what I needed to do to get ahead just like you. 
There's no comparison. 
Running that story will harm the country. 
I've been in Washington a lot longer than you. 
You'll see, this is how the way the game is played. 
Actually, Ken, this is how the game is played. 
What do you mean? 
You run that story, or ever try to blackmail me again, and I'll make sure everyone knows just how you get your leads. 
I think your wife will be especially interested. 
From everything you've told me, that's gonna be one nasty divorce. 
You bitch. 
Find a new beat, Ken. 
I don't want to see you around the White House again. 
Sorry, I've got to take this. 
Hi. 
Where in the world are you? 
I'm sorry. I had a 
meeting on K Street. 
I had to run interference with a reporter. 
Are the press on to this? 
Not anymore. 
I took care of it. 
I need you here, Livy. 
We've had confirmation on the bioweapons, and the air strike is happening now. 
I'll be there in five minutes. 
Where are we, Admiral? 
The F-18's have been loaded with bunker-buster ordinance and will be in range in seven minutes. 
What's the risk of the pathogen spreading to the surrounding areas? 
Minimal. 
We're using white phosphorous charges, which burn at 5,000 degrees. 
More than enough to incinerate the pathogen. 
And that's been confirmed by the CDC. 
It has. 
Weapons are ready? 
Yes, sir. 
The call to the president? 
The call is in process. 
It's an historic day, gentlemen. 
A great day for Starkwood. 
Too bad Mr. Knowles 
can't be joining us. 
I have an ETAC with eyes on. Airborne. 
Roger, I need 9,000 feet MSL and weapons control status, over. 
Weapons control status: yellow tight. 
Fighters entering the IP. 
Engage airspace coordination area. 
Roger that. 
Stand by. 
Madam President, command and control is reporting that a phased array radar system is active inside the Starkwood compound. 
Meaning what exactly? 
They know we're coming. 
Is there any evidence of an antiaircraft artillery threat? 
Intelligence is indicating no such capability on the ground. 
Madam President, there's a phone call for you. 
It's Jonas Hodges. 
Put him on speaker. 
Ma'am, he's requested a private conversation. 
He says he's established a proprietary line in the Ops Room. 
A proprietary line? 
How did he manage that? 
I have no idea. 
Hello. 
Madam President, let me begin by saying that I am truly sorry it's come to this. 
at you turn your planes around immediately. 
You're in no position to issue ultimatums, Mr. Hodges. 
Well, maybe I am. 
You remember several years ago, Madam President, Starkwood was deployed to Pakistan. 
Oh, I remember it very well. 
I fought that deployment. 
And you lost. 
You'll also recall that we requisitioned a missile system at that time Python Fives. 
Well, three of those missiles are now loaded with the pathogen and aimed at cities on our eastern seaboard. 
You're bluffing. 
As a sign of good faith, I'm willing to show you that I'm... that I'm not bluffing. 
You see that? 
Madam President? 
Hmm? 
You call this good faith? 
You are waging war on your own country, Jonas. 
Well, of course, I wouldn't see it that way. 
What do you want? 
Well, we can have that conversation a little later on at the White House. 
You think we're going to just sit down and discuss this? 
Yes I do, in the Oval Office, in confidence, within the hour. 
But in the meantime, I think it is to both of our advantage that the American people do not know the exact circumstance of this standoff. 
So you will keep this conversation to yourself, and turn the planes around. 
And if you don't comply, Madam President, I will have no choice but to launch those missiles. 
Mr. Hodges... 
And remember, I can detect any action you take against our facility. 
You have 30 seconds. 
Mr. Hodges... 
Mr. Hodges! 
Abort the air strike, Admiral Smith. 
Madam President... 
Just do as I say. 
Ma'am, with all respect... 
Damn it, Admiral, abort the air strike immediately! 
This is Admiral Smith. 
I have an abort order from the president. 
Take fighters off target. 
Repeat: take fighters off target. 
Stand by for confirmation code. 
We're standing down, Madam President. 
We need to pick him off to try to save the president. 
I'll make a run for the lockdown room. 
There are five canisters of ch-4. 
All we need is one stray bullet. 
A suicide play,jack. 
We don't have a choice. 
Don't you move! 
We have the president! 
The president is secure! 
I'm so sorry,jack. 
I know that he was your friend. 
It was supposed to be me. 
Juma and his men were not working alone. 
And right now,the only lead we've got is ryan burnett. 
He knew about the attack on the white house, And chances are,he's gonna know who juma was talking to. 
I'm thinking about Bringing olivia on As a special advisor. 
Nobody's forgotten what she did during the campaign. 
Leaking damaging personal information About your opponent to the press. 
She's changed. 
It's not the past that concerns me. 
Do you think any of this Would've happened if my mother had a chief advisor Who knew what the hell was going on in her administration? 
I just got off the phone with ethan kanin. 
He's ordering me to let bauer interrogate burnett. 
Look,i didn't want to go behind your back, But you didn't leave me any choice. 
I want you to clean out your office And hand in your badge. 
I'm suspending you. 
Jack bauer's on his way to kennedy memorial hospital. 
Burnett will tell him everything. 
I have already sent somebody to the hospital To deal with burnett. 
He can take care of bauer at the same time. 
You lay one finger on him,it's over. 
Right. 
Juma's attack failed. 
He's dead,so are his men. 
Somebody get me the hell out of here! 
You're not going anywhere. 
What happened? 
What's going on? 
Damn it,bauer,open the door! 
I want a high-priority apb issued for jack bauer. 
Larry,it's jack. listen to me. 
I'm being set up. 
Don't let them get away with this. 
This threat is not over. 
The following takes place between 9 p.m. 
and 10 p.m. 
I dropped my wife off here five hours ago, And now no one can tell me where she is. 
Mr. o'brian,the white 
house has been attacked. 
We're in the midst of an urgent protocol. 
Exactly. that's why i'd like to 
know if my wife all right. 
She is; she's fine. 
Where is she? 
Tell me. 
She's in a holding room on the third floor. 
What...? she's been arrested. 
That's absurd. 
What's she charged with? 
i want to see her. 
Listen,i've already told you more than i should have. 
When agent moss returns,he'll tell you Everything you need to know. 
In the meanwhile,i'm gonna have To ask you to wait in the conference room,okay? 
Please. i'm sorry. 
Please escort him to the conference room. 
Thank you. 
Janis,larry's calling for you. 
He says it's urgent. 
What line? three. 
Sign here,verifying you understand The terms of your suspension, And again here... 
Agent walker? 
Go ahead, i'm listening. 
Larry,it's janis. 
Ryan burnett is dead. 
How? 
Bauer was interrogating him when it happened, And we're responsible. 
You're saying that bauer killed burnett? 
I don't know. 
He escaped before i could get to him. 
He called me,said he was being set up and he wouldn't come in. 
I lost him,janis. 
I lost him,and it's on me to find him. 
Just tell me what you need. 
I already sent out a priority,all-agency apb. 
I need you to follow up on that. 
I'm coming back to the office right now. 
I'll coordinate the search operation from there. 
Okay. 
Open an all-agency channel With flags for immediate action on jack bauer. 
I'll make sure the local police departments Are linked in. 
On it. thank you. 
Janis,what did larry say? 
Jack get anything out of burnett? 
You're suspended. 
I cannot discuss this with you. 
Janis,this was my case. 
Tell me if jack got anything out of burnett. 
Burnett is dead. 
Well,tell me what happened. 
Bauer was there,and now he's missing. 
Janis,the channel's open. 
Thank you. 
That's all i know,honestly. 
So,please,let me get back to work,okay? 
Please attach jack bauer's profile to the apb. 
Got you. 
Walker. 
Renee,it's jack. 
Don't hang up the phone,please. 
Whatever they told you,i did not kill burnett. 
Renee? 
Yeah. 
Bill was right. 
There are still very powerful people Involved in this conspiracy that were not named In dubaku's drive. 
They're trying to cover their tracks. 
They killed burnett,and they're framing me for it. 
Even if i wanted to help you,jack, Larry has every law enforcement agency within 100 miles Looking for you,and i have been suspended. 
All i want you to do is make an i.d. 
I got a frame grab from the hospital's surveillance. 
I sent you a photo Of the man who did kill burnett. 
It's in your inbox. 
Renee,this man is The only connection i have to whoever else Is involved in this thing. 
Please,i need your help. 
Look,i know you don't agree with some of thing i did to the But... i'm telling 
you the truth. 
Renee? 
You know what? 
Forget it. i'm-i'm sorry. 
I made a mistake. 
I'll call you back at this number. 
Metro police, This is the fbi reporting. 
We have a suspect,jack bauer,that's escaped custody. 
All available units,please respond. 
Yes,quinn. 
Bauer got away from the fbi. 
How? 
Well,bauer is An extremely impressive operative. 
You don't have to tell me that. 
But the fbi has launched a major effort to apprehend him. 
He won't be able to avoid them for long. 
Well,we'll see,won't we? 
Monitor the situation,keep me apprised. 
Yes,sir. 
If bauer connects us to juma, It could seriously impede this operation. 
Yes,it could. 
Is the shipment on time? 
Yes. due into port 
in the next hour. 
Then I don't foresee a problem. 
Once the weapons are deployed, Then it doesn't matter what mr. 
bauer or anyone else knows. 
Something wrong? 
No,sir. 
Mr. seaton,I get no pleasure 
From the knowledge that people will die at our hands. 
One single soul,the loss of one soul is tragic to me, Let alone the numbers we're talking about! 
But do not forget that every war Worth fighting involves collateral damage. 
And what we're doing Is fundamentally and absolutely necessary! 
And I know you understand that! 
Of course. 
Wake up our colleagues And have them assembled in one hour. 
And tell them to pack their pajamas and their toothbrushes. 
It's gonna be a long night. 
Yeah? 
 I have an I.D.  Who is it? 
John quinn. 
Black ops combat vet. 
Served tours all over the world. 
Now he works for starkwood. 
The defense consultant? 
Uh,yeah,they started out as consultants, But over the past few years,while you were Out of the country,the pentagon outsourced Billions of dollars in contracts to them. 
What kind of contracts? 
Manpower. 
Starkwood's basically a private army. 
They recruit ex-soldiers and swat team members From around the world, Then they hire them back to the military security teams. 
We're talking thousands of men deployed here and abroad. 
Starkwood work with juma? 
Well,if they did,it wasn't on the books. 
But,you know,if anyone knows,it's senator mayer. 
Why mayer? 
After he dismantled ctu, He launched several other investigations. 
One of them has been looking at starkwood. 
What were they accused of? 
The hearings are classified,but Supposedly,mayer has enough to put them out of business. 
Okay,i'm gonna need to talk to him. 
See if you can access the CIRG logs. 
They should have a location on him. 
Okay. i'll send you mayer's 
location as soon as i have it. 
Thanks. 
Agent walker still here? 
She was just in her office. 
But there's somebody waiting to see you In the conference room. 
they need to... 
Just have a few more forms to fill out, Then I'm taking off. 
You hear what happened at the hospital? 
After everything that jack's done today, Do you really believe that he murdered Burnett? 
I don't know. 
I... I don't care. 
He's a federal fugitive and needs to be found. 
But you think it's possible that he did this? 
I'm not sure I do. 
It's been a long day. 
Go home,get some sleep. 
 I'll call you in the morning. 
 Okay. 
Excuse me,Larry. 
Morris o'brian is waiting in the conference room. 
He wants to know why his wife is in holding. 
Renee talked to bauer. 
How do you know? 
Access her phone log for the last 15 minutes And get into her workstation, find out what she's been doing All right. 
If we want to catch bauer,she's our best shot. 
Okay. 
We've received confirmation that president taylor will be making a statement to the country shortly. 
She is expected to address the attack on the white house That ended an hour ago in a startling rescue. 
Now,based on the few details we have, We do know the rescue resulted in the death Of general juma and all of his forces. 
Angela,how much lead time does the media need, Once I'm finished with my revisions? 
The major outlets will put us on immediately. 
I'll be done shortly. 
Thank you,angela. 
I have a thought About the speech,if you'd like to hear it. 
Of course. 
Right now your main thrust is reassurance. 
The attacks are behind us, Everything's going to be back to normal. 
But I think you're missing an opportunity here. 
To do what? 
Claim victory. 
To say that juma's death means standing up To tyranny works,and that your decision To send troops into sangala was the right one. 
I'm not sure that this is The appropriate time to sound triumphant,livy. 
A lot of lives were lost today. 
And by addressing those deaths,you give them meaning. 
Those people are heroes Who died in a war that was worth fighting. 
Let's work it in. 
Come in. 
Madam president,i have some troubling news. 
May i speak with you alone? 
You my speak freely in front of olivia. 
Just after the attack on the white house, Jack bauer came forward With a disturbing claim. 
He said there were people Still at large who were involved in the conspiracy Persons unknown who had helped juma Plan and execute the attacks. 
Did bauer have any evidence of this? 
Nothing concrete. 
But he promoted the notion that ryan burnett Was our best chance of identifying these people, And bauer asked to be allowed to question him. 
This was supposed to be a controlled situation. 
A ploy to intimidate burnett into giving up intel. 
So,I granted bauer's request. 
It was a terrible mistake. 
What happened,ethan? 
Burnett is dead. 
My god... 
The evidence suggests That he was killed by bauer. 
I don't believe it! 
His claim of another party being involved in the attacks Appear to have been a fabrication. 
A fabrication. 
It may have something to do with bill buchanan's death; No one knows. 
But madam president, I take full responsibility. 
I was trying to insulate you. 
To provide you with deniability In case anything went wrong. 
Or was it because you thought the president would say no? 
Olivia. 
Where is bauer now? 
At large. 
The fbi is devoting its full resources to the manhunt. 
Let me know the minute they find him. 
Yes,ma'am. 
Madam president... 
I'm sorry. 
Looks like everything. 
She's on the move. 
Where's bauer? 
I don't know. 
Don't you lie to me. 
We traced two calls from your cell To a phone that was reported stolen. 
And we know you accessed a classified government database And sent someone's name and address to bauer. 
Renee,that makes you an accessory after the fact. 
Now tell me where he is. 
I can't. 
Damn it! 
I still don't believe that he did this. 
Then explain to me why he's not turning himself in, And letting us help him find this mysterious third party. 
Because he was framed and he doesn't trust Our ability to work through it. 
And,you know,after what we've put him through, How can you blame him? 
You're actually willing To sacrifice everything to protect him. 
Once jack finds the evidence,he will call us. 
You know,janis is decrpyting what you sent. 
It's not going to take her a long time. 
We are going to find him. 
Renee,tell me whose information you sent. 
I'll let the A.G. 
know that you're cooperating. 
I'm sorry,larry. 
Put her in holding. 
Mirandize her. 
Good night,sir. 
See you in the morning. 
Hello? 
Keep your hands where i can see them,senator. 
Bauer. 
Take a seat. 
I know what you did to ryan burnett. 
I'm not going to let you butcher me like you did him. 
You want me dead,bauer, You'll have to kill me where i stand. 
If i wanted to kill you,senator, You'd be dead already. 
Now take a seat! 
You're a real enigma,bauer. 
An hour after you save the president from terrorists, You murder a federal witness in cold blood. 
I didn't kill burnett. 
This man did. 
Do you know who he is? 
No. 
His name is john quinn. 
He works for starkwood. 
What in the world does starkwood have to do with this? 
I don't know yet. 
But i do know they sent someone to kill burnett And frame me to cover up their involvement In everything that's happened today, Including the attack on the white house. 
That's a hell of a theory,bauer. 
But you'll have to spin a better story than that If you expect it to get you off the hook. 
Senator,i did not come here to clear my name. 
I'm trying to understand The connection between juma and starkwood. 
There isn't one. 
I've spent the better part of six months Investigating starkwood. 
If there was a connection to juma or sangala, I would know it. 
I want to see every file you have Concerning that investigation. 
Look... 
Starkwood has let their security teams run amok All over the world,with no oversight. 
They've bribed their way into large contracts, They've tried to influence foreign policy To their own benefit all good reasons Why this country should not be outsourcing Its military operations to private corporations. 
And i am going to shut them down. 
But there is nothing to remotely suggest They'd be involved in terrorist attacks on their own country For any amount of money. 
Maybe they have different reasons for helping juma. 
Like what? 
I don't know. 
Sir,i believe this country is still under attack, And there has to be a reason. 
And i'm supposed to believe this, Coming from a man who's holding me hostage? 
I need access to those files. 
And if the connection Between juma and starkwood isn't there, Will you turn yourself in,then? 
Just open the files,sir. 
Ladies and gentlemen, The president will be making a brief statement tonight. 
Good luck,mom. 
I'm sure you'll understand, Based on the events of today, There will be no opportunity for follow-up questions. 
Ladies and gentlemen, The president of the united states. 
Thank you very much. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
My fellow americans,john adams, The first president to take up residence in the white house, Once prayed for heaven to bestow Its blessings on this place. 
Tonight,those blessings have seen us through A brutal attack by a desperate tyrant. 
We have lost friends and loved ones here, But we have prevailed. 
I have commanded law enforcement agencies, Emergency services and first responders To keep their deployment level... 
Mr. kanin,ken dellao,cnb. 
I'm wondering if you can confirm some information I received a short time ago? 
Ken,this is clearly not the time... 
Yeah,i'm,i'm going to be Reporting in this evening's broadcast That a rogue ex-federal agent named jack bauer Is the prime suspect in the murder of ryan burnett. 
...cannot forget 
today's events. 
The lives we lost... 
Where did you get this? 
So,it's true,then? 
I'm not confirming anything. 
I'll also be reporting That you authorized bauer's release from custody And arranged for his access to the victim. 
...daughters and 
sons,brothers and sisters, But they have not taken our spirit. 
Make no mistake,today's attacks Were intended to crush our resolve. 
Mr. kanin. 
I said no comment. 
But america is not so easily broken. 
Our military action in sangala has been a success. 
At this hour,our forces have taken control of sangala city. 
We have won. 
I see you're back to your old tactics. 
What? 
You leaked the story of burnett's murder And my involvement to the press. 
Ethan,i don't know what you're talking about. 
Olivia,don't bother denying it. 
I can count on one hand the number of people Who knew i'd authorized bauer's release. 
So another one of your errors in judgment bites you have And you think you can lay the blame on me. 
Do you realize what you've done? 
In trying to hurt me, You'll have caused tremendous damage to your mother. 
The president has gone on record That torture is unacceptable under any circumstances. 
When this gets out,it will look like bauer was sent Exactly for that. 
It'll be a political disaster. 
You've gone too far this time. 
I'm not listening to you anymore. 
I'm not going to let you get away with this. 
Get your hands off me. 
As americans, We should stand together proud Of what we have achieved. 
Thanks to the efforts and the sacrifices Of so many,this place,our national home, Stands tall tonight. 
And all our citizens can sleep soundly with the knowledge That the blessings of freedom continue to shine upon us all. 
No,there's been no sign of bauer in the northeast sector, So expand your cordon to the 25-mile mark. 
And be prepared to back up metro. 
I'm directing them to begin random traffic stops,citywide. 
Thank you. 
I isolated the data renee uploaded to bauer, But i can't get past the file header. 
What does that mean? 
She encrypted the name and address she used, And i can't seem to crack it. 
You can't? 
she used her personal computer. 
This is very serious encryption. 
I mean,there are some high-level people who can do it. like who? 
Chloe o'brian but from what you've told me,she's still loyal to Bauer. 
Is her husband still here? 
Yeah. He's waiting to see you. 
According to her file,he's a level-six analyst,too. 
Yeah. He's waiting to see me. 
I have no idea how much longer i'm going to be here. 
Just do me a favor and give prescott his babu Before you put him down. 
Yeah,i'm going to have to call you back. yeah. 
Mr. o'brian,i'm larry moss. 
Yeah,i'd like to see my wife. 
All right. 
What the bloody hell are you holding her for? 
Obstruction,evidence tampering. 
I think you should be more concerned about What you can do to get her out. sorry? 
Help us find jack bauer. 
Last i heard from chloe,jack was working for the bureau. 
That's you,if i'm not mistaken. 
He was. 
Until he snapped and murdered a federal witness. 
Really? 
I find that hard to believe. 
All that's relevant here is that your wife Is going to be prosecuted for colluding with bauer, Unless you help us find him. 
Mr. o'brian, 
A short time ago, One of our agents was in touch with jack bauer. 
She sent a name and address That we assume is his next destination. 
Unfortunately,it's encrypted with blowfish 148. 
No one here knows how to crack that. 
Therefore,we need your help. 
Please. 
Jack bauer and my wife have a very long history. 
I consider him to be a friend. 
And he'll have his day in court. 
But the case against your wife Is rock solid. 
I can't. 
We're talking about her serving a minimum sentence of 15 years. 
Your son will be 19 by the time she gets out of prison. 
I want guarantees of full immunity, No jail time,expulsion of all charges from her record. 
You have my word. 
You are a witness to this agreement. 
Yes. 
Show me the file. 
Original information 16- or 32-bit word length? thirty-two. 
Native or modified data points? 
Native. 
The designer of this algorithm Built a backdoor into his code. 
Decryption's a piece of cake if you know the override codes. 
And you do? 
Yeah. 
Will this take long? 
Course not. 
Mr. o'brian,can you 
tell me specifically When you'll have the file decrypted? 
Yes. 
Now. 
Your agent sent jack to 951 deerbrook avenue,georgetown, Residence of senator blaine mayer. 
Assemble the field teams. 
Tell them we have a probable location on bauer. 
And get metro pd on the way. 
No luck reaching mayer on his cell or at the house. 
The phone company said The line was shorted out on-site. 
Yeah,that's bauer. 
Why is he doing this? 
Because mayer spent the last six months Trying to send bauer to prison for the rest of his life. 
All right,metro pd is closing in on mayer's residence. 
I've authorized them to move in As soon as they're in position and at strength. 
I told them,and i'm telling you,it is impossible to overestimate bauer. 
He has more training and more experience Than anybody in this room,and that includes myself. 
Okay,let's move. 
Agent moss will be running on-point tactical with fbi teams on five. 
All units must register and log their com through me, And i will distribute recognition codes and credentials. 
Chloe... i can't believe you. 
You're helping them catch jack. 
I did it for you. 
This is the last thing i would have wanted. 
How could you do this? 
let's see,for a start, I thought it might be nice to spare prescott The inconvenience of having a convict for a mother. 
Jack saved your life. 
i don't deny that i owe him. 
But my child and my marriage comes first, And it should for you,too. 
Chloe,love,you've helped jack enough. 
You have. 
And you can't go deciding to make this sacrifice on your own. 
But he didn't do what they're saying he did. 
Then he can prove that when they take him into custody. 
If they give him the chance. 
At the hearing this morning,you said you had no regrets About what you've done. 
But what i saw was a man full of regret. 
Of course i have regrets,senator. 
I regret losing my family. 
My wife was murdered because i was responsible For protecting david palmer during an assassination attempt. 
My daughter can't even look at me. 
Every day,i regret looking into the eyes Of men,women and children, Knowing that,any moment, Their lives might be deemed expendable In an effort to protect the greater good. 
I regret every decision or mistake i might have made That resulted in the loss of a single innocent life. 
But you know what i regret the most? 
Is that this world even needs people like me. 
So you think i'm naive to believe We need to hold ourselves to a higher standard of combat? 
Doesn't even matter what i think,senator. 
You just need to understand where i work, Things get a lot messier than where you work on the hill. 
What you've lost,mr. 
bauer,is tragic. 
What you've been compelled to do In the name of saving innocent life is tragic. 
Sometimes we need to incur the most horrible losses In order to uphold the ideals That this country was founded on. 
How can we presume to lead the world Unless we set an example? 
You make it sound so simple. 
Well,maybe it's simpler than you think. 
Maybe all the things that you've seen And all the things that you've done have cloud of your vision. 
Look at this. 
Tell me about this car accident. 
That has nothing to do with juma. 
Who was the victim? 
A source inside of starkwood. 
A whistle-blower. 
Unfortunately,he was also a drunk. 
He was killed when he wrecked his car On the way home from atlantic city. 
Blood alcohol off the charts. 
Senator,this was no accident. 
Your informant was murdered by the same man Who took ryan burnett out this evening. 
What does this mean,bauer? 
They were scared of what he had to say. 
What does your informant have on starkwood? 
He made a lot of wild accusations, But not a single one of them panned out. 
Maybe you didn't dig deep enough. 
Senator,i need to know exactly what he told you. 
He alleged that starkwood Was blackmailing pentagon officials. 
That they were involved in assassination plots. 
Even that they were seeking to acquire their own wmds. 
Specifically what? 
Well,i don't remember,but i'm sure That his interview transcript should be there. 
Okay,i got it. 
Oh,my god. 
That's it. 
What? 
Your informant claims that starkwood Was trying to acquire a bioweapon. 
That's your connection to juma. 
I don't understand. 
When juma was in power,it was rumored That he was running an illegal weapons program. 
He was developing a bioweapon, But nobody could prove it. 
But the people that i knew in sangala Believed he was testing these weapons on his own population. 
He used a remote village, Released some kind of pathogen. 
Everyone there was struck with dementia, Paralysis and eventually died. 
Why wasn't this pursued? 
'cause juma destroyed all the evidence. 
He firebombed the village before anyone Could get there,and un officials Had a hard time believing that juma had the technology Or expertise to develop such a weapon. 
But starkwood... they had both. 
The technology and the expertise. 
And what did juma have to offer starkwood? 
A safe haven to develop the weapon And an endless supply of victims to test it on. 
Even if all this was true,why in the world Would starkwood want a bioweapon? 
Senator,you've been trying to dismantle starkwood For the last six months. 
Maybe they planned on fighting back. 
But regardless,if they have a weapon like this, You better believe they intend to use it. 
Senator mayer! 
This is metro pd! 
Don't you move. 
Hold on. hold on! 
You're obviously on to something. 
They can help you Find the evidence you need to prove your case. 
Right now everyone thinks i killed ryan burnett. 
 No one's gonna listen to me. 
 i can protect you. 
I can order them to help us. 
Starkwood infiltrated the white house. 
As soon as they find out you're going after them For a bioweapon,they'll bury the evidence. 
Then we'll keep the circle small. 
I can make this happen. 
It's time for you to start trusting the institutions That you've sacrificed so much to protect. 
Trust isn't my greatest asset. 
Son,you have to start somewhere. 
Senator! 
This is metro pd! 
You really think you can do this? 
I know i can. 
Let 'em in. 
Coming! 
No! 
You wanted to see me? 
Yes,livy. 
Ethan just come to me with something very disturbing. 
I assume it's about the press leak regarding jack bauer. 
Ethan seems to think you had something to do with it. 
I didn't. 
I already told him that. 
Well,given the past experience Between the two of you,he's not convinced. 
And what do you think? 
I think i need to hear what you have to say. 
There's nothing she can say,madam president. 
She was one of the few people Who knew all the details. 
More people knew than you think. 
I just got off the phone with the white house secretary producer At cnb. 
He won't give me the source's name, But he's willing to confirm That the leak came from someone inside the federal Marshal's office. 
He'll guarantee it didn't come from the white house, Or from me. 
This is verifiable? 
Producer's name is charlie isakson. 
Here's his number. 
You can call him yourself if you'd like. 
I offered isakson some Exclusive time with you if he killed the story, And he agreed. 
So as long as we get bauer in custody, We should be able to keep the fallout contained. 
Ethan,under the circumstances, I think it seems clear That you were mistaken. 
I'm satisfied. 
Are you? 
Yes,madam president. 
I'm sorry,olivia, If i misjudged The situation... 
And you. 
I want to know If the fbi's any closer to finding bauer. 
Yes,ma'am. 
That's all. 
I'm sorry  I put you on the spot like that. 
 i understand. 
Ethan didn't give you much of a choice. 
I just hope They find bauer before this gets any worse. 
You're dying. 
Just tell me where The weapons are coming in. 
When are they getting here? 
They're already here. 
Janis,it's larry. 
We got here too late. 
Bauer murdered senator mayer. 
Escalate the search for him to region-wide. 
I want reinforcements from every branch Within 50 miles brought into this. 
Copy that. 
At this point... 
Orders are to shoot on sight. 
Yeah. 
Tony,it's jack. 
Jack,i've been monitoring the fbi bandwidth. 
What the hell's going on? 
Listen,man,i need your help. 
where are you? 
3rd street and b. 
Okay,listen to me,i need you To meet me at the port of alexandria. 
I need you to bring a weapons and a surveillance package. 
 Get there as soon as possible. 
 jack,wait. 
I can't. i'll get back to 
you as soon as i'm en route. 
Ken Dellao, CNB. 
I'm wondering if you can confirm some information. 
I'm gonna be reporting in this evening's broadcast that a rogue ex-federal agent named Jack Bauer is the prime suspect in the murder of Ryan Burnett. 
You leaked this story of Burnett's murder and my involvement to the press. 
So another one of your errors in judgment bites you on the ass. 
You've gone too far this time. 
Renee, it's Jack. 
Don't hang up the phone, please. 
Whatever they told you, I did not kill Burnett. 
I sent you a photo of the man who did. 
All I want you to do is make an ID. 
John Quinn, Black Ops combat vet. 
He works for Starkwood. 
Starkwood work with Juma? 
If they did, it wasn't on the books. 
You know, if anyone knows, it's Senator Mayer. 
Renee, where's Bauer? 
I don't know. 
Don't you lie to me. 
We know you accessed a classified government database and sent someone's name and address to Bauer. 
Tell me where he is. 
I can't. 
Put her in holding. 
Mirandize her. 
If Bauer connects us to Juma, it could seriously impede this operation. 
Yes, it could. 
Is the shipment on time? 
Yes. Due into port 
in the next hour. 
Once the weapons are deployed, then it doesn't matter what Mr. Bauer 
or anyone else knows. 
I didn't kill Burnett. 
This man did. 
His name is John Quinn. 
He works for Starkwood. 
And what does Starkwood have to do with this? 
Your informant claims that Starkwood was trying to acquire a bioweapon, and that's your connection to Juma. 
You've been trying to dismantle Starkwood for the last six months. 
If they have a weapon like this, you better believe they intend to use it. 
No! 
Just tell me where the weapons are coming in. 
You're too late. 
They're already here. 
(sighs) Sir? 
Preliminary sweep of the immediate area's done. 
There's no sign of Bauer. 
All right, widen the grid. 
And run down security cameras around the perimeter, witnesses. 
Somebody must have seen him. 
Yes, sir. 
Yes? 
Mr. Kanin, it's Larry Moss. 
Agent Moss, please tell me you have Jack Bauer in custody. 
I wish that were the case, Mr. 
Kanin, but the truth is... 
Sir, it's Senator Mayer. 
He's dead. 
What?! 
He was murdered at his house. 
We only found out that Bauer was on his way over here a short time ago. 
Unfortunately, we got here too late. 
Wait a minute. 
Are you telling me that Jack Bauer just killed a United States Senator? 
That's the assumption that we're working under, yes, sir. 
How could you have let this happen?! 
He had us all fooled, sir. 
I released Jack Bauer into your custody! 
I ordered you to keep him on a short leash! 
No, no. Mr. Kanin, you are not 
gonna lay this one at my feet. 
It was your decision to give Bauer access to Burnett. 
I advised you against it. 
Mr. Kanin? 
I'm sorry. 
Uh, what did you say? 
I said, I advised you against it. 
Yes, you did. 
Sir, I have teams sweeping the area. 
Just find him, Agent Moss. 
Yeah, I will. 
Starkwood was involved with everything that happened today. 
They were the ones that helped Juma and his men bring down those planes and attack the White House. 
In exchange, they were allowed to develop and manufacture a WMD in Sangala. 
It's a bioweapon. 
Apparently, it's already here in the US. 
Who else knows about this? 
No one. Senator Mayer and I were 
piecing together the information right before he was killed. 
You said the weapon's already here. 
Are they in possession of it? 
I don't think so. 
The text message I got off their agent's cell phone said, "Port of Alexandria, Lot C, 10:15 p.m." 
Why don't we just call the FBI and lock the whole place down? 
Because we're fugitives, Tony. 
No one's going to believe us. 
We need to know exactly where that weapon is before we call anyone else in. 
Tony, I need to know if you're with me on this. 
Yeah, I'm with you. 
Okay. Meet me at the 
north end of the port. 
There's an access road right before the main entrance. 
All right, I'll be there. 
It's over. 
Dubaku and Juma are dead. 
Everyone responsible for the terrorist attacks... 
responsible for Roger. 
Thank God for that. 
And there's... 
there's something else. 
Something good that's come out of all of this. 
Olivia is here at the White House. 
Olivia? 
She's come home, Henry. 
The crisis it brought us together. 
I've asked her to stay on as Special Advisor, and-and she's agreed. 
Ally... 
I can't begin to tell you how happy that makes me. 
Me, too. 
Sweetheart, I know that you're tired. 
You should get some rest. 
Olivia and I will come to the hospital just as soon as we can. 
When you can. 
I'm not going anywhere. 
Give Olivia my love. 
Love you. 
We love you, too. 
The doctors expect him to make a full recovery. 
Henry's a lot tougher than anyone thought. 
Oh, maybe, maybe, maybe, just maybe, this day will end on a positive note. 
What is it, Ethan? 
What's wrong? 
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Madam President, but Senator Mayer is dead. 
What happened? 
All evidence points to the fact that he was murdered by Jack Bauer. 
Bauer? 
It's hard to believe, I know. 
It-It doesn't make any sense. 
After everything he has done today, why on earth would he do this? 
We'll know more when we find him. 
My God. 
Madam President, in light of what's happened, and for the sake of your administration, I'm afraid I have no choice but to resign as your Chief of Staff. 
Ethan! 
Madam President, please, you need to hear this. 
Inevitably, it'll come to light that I sanctioned Bauer's release from custody. 
Unless I step down immediately, the damage to your office, and you personally, will be extensive. 
Ethan, Olivia has already killed this story once today. 
We can control the damage. 
No. 
No, not even Olivia can control it now. 
Not after the senator's murder. 
The truth is, Madam President, I didn't do enough to protect you. 
The truth is, I failed you. 
And I should shoulder the blame for what's happened. 
Ethan, really, you're... 
you're taking this too far. 
Am I? 
I'm not so sure. 
As your daughter has made abundantly clear, I have a lot to answer for. 
You have done nothing but be an invaluable advisor to me and an even better friend. 
I appreciate you saying that, Madam President, but Olivia's right. 
The political knives will be out. 
Every decision I've made will be scrutinized. 
There will be calls for a special prosecutor. 
You're a great woman, Allison. 
You have great work yet to do. 
I'm a liability to you now. 
Don't let me compromise your next three years in office. 
Don't let me sink your agenda. 
Our agenda, Ethan. 
Yes. 
Our agenda. 
Trust me, Madam President, it's the right thing to do. 
Accept my resignation. 
I'll have a letter on your desk in the morning. 
They're gonna be here any minute. 
We need to narrow down the search. 
If they offloaded it today, it should still be on the storage dock. 
That's still a needle in a haystack, Jack. 
There must be over a thousand containers in there. 
We need to access the yard's manifest. 
What's the security? 
I've spotted one Port Authority officer. 
That's it? 
That's it. 
There's got to be more. 
Come on, let's go. 
Honey, it'll be fine. 
I get relieved in a few hours. 
Carl, you know I don't like you working double shifts. 
Well, it was my choice. 
And we could use the overtime. 
How are the girls? 
Kicking like a chorus line tonight. 
They miss their daddy. 
What'd the doctor say? 
That I'm lucky it's not triplets. 
Honey, let me call you back. 
Don't even think about going for your weapon. 
I need the port's manifest. 
Where is it? 
I'm just a PA cop. 
Where is it? 
Customs House. 
That way. 
Let's go. 
We on schedule? 
STOKES (on phone): We're at the staging area near the port, sir, but we're still waiting on Quinn. 
He should have been there by now. 
Have you heard from him? 
We've tried his cell, but he's not answering. 
If Bauer took out Quinn, he might have knowledge of the operation. 
Mightn't he? 
Should we stand down, sir? 
No. Give Quinn five more minutes, 
then go in. 
Do so with extreme caution then contact me the minute that you've secured the container. 
Yes, sir. 
SEATON: Everybody on the board is here, sir. 
You have a worried look, Greg. 
It's very tense in there, sir. 
They're six-year-olds, Greg. 
And they need to eat their carrots. 
It's been a rough day for the United States of America. 
The White House under siege, the President taken hostage... 
It's especially painful because we know this didn't have to be. 
Fact: the United States military is strained to the breaking point. 
Fact: reinstatement of the draft is off the table for political reasons. 
Fact: the people in this room, you all control the largest private army in the Western hemisphere. 
Now, could we have been of help today? 
You bet your ass we could've been of help! 
But they didn't call us, did they? 
No. Instead, we sit here, 
our contracts are canceled, our soldiers vilified, our corporate sovereignty is threatened by congressional fiat. 
Doug, you brokered the deal with this government. 
You were short-sighted and they don't understand that the global war on terror can only be won by forces like ours. 
So as of this minute, we sit for no more depositions. 
We volunteer no more documents. 
I don't even want us to take any phone calls. Is that what this is about? 
With the security of our country, Is that what this is about? 
we cannot afford to let them take us down. 
Is that what this is about then? 
You came here to ask the board to risk a federal indictment? 
It won't work, Jonas. 
We got a deal. 
It's a good deal and we're lucky to have it. 
With an administration that wants to destroy us. 
Wants to take us out of business. 
No, it's all different now. 
Today was a game-changer. 
No, institutionally, we are in compliance with the subpoena. 
Documents have been filed, depositions taken. 
Not anymore. 
Jonas, we have to stay engaged with this administration. No, we don't, Doug. 
So look, you and I can talk this out. 
If you guys have any questions, any further questions, Greg, you will stick around and you'll answer them. 
Thank you for coming everyone. 
Thank you. 
Your way was a mistake, Doug. 
You have to acknowledge that. 
Maybe. But you and I both know 
that Starkwood cannot survive an all-out war against the subcommittee. 
Let me worry about that. 
No, you should worry about Senator Mayer. 
He's not going to let go of this. 
He's got his teeth in it. 
Senator Mayer's dead. 
He was killed by a rogue federal agent not one hour ago, tragically. 
Jonas. 
Tell me you had nothing to do with this. 
Are you accusing me of complicity in the murder of Senator Mayer? 
I want a personal assurance. 
Starkwood is not in the business of political assassination, Doug. 
Though maybe we should look into it. 
I hear it's a growth market. 
Jack, you finding anything? 
12 ships were unloaded here today. 
Any from Sangala? There's no deepwater 
port in that area of West Africa. 
If the weapon originated from there, it would've had to overland into Pointe-Noire. 
Where... 
two of the 12 ships acquired cargo from that port within the last four weeks. 
Come on. 
Come on. Damn it! 
What is it? I can't access 
their manifests; their database is password protected. 
What's your name, officer? 
Gadsen. 
Carl Gadsen. 
I don't have any information about a password. 
Carl, I want you to listen to me very carefully. 
The same terrorists who took down two planes earlier today and attacked the White House are trying to acquire a weapon of mass destruction. 
They're coming here to pick up that weapon. 
It's somewhere out there in your yard in one of those canisters. 
Look, I understand this might be hard for you to believe. 
No, actually, it's not. 
You don't have a lot of time. 
What do you mean? 
They are coming. 
In fact, they should be here already. 
Keep talking, Carl. 
They told me they were smuggling in electronics from South Korea. 
I swear. 
I had no idea they were terrorists. 
What'd you agree to do for them? 
Open the front gate. 
Look the other way. 
Is that it? 
Disable the security cameras. 
A yard this size should have more police officers. 
Where are they? 
I'm the supervisor. 
I do the shift schedules. 
I made sure I'd be the only one here. 
That's enough confirmation for me. 
I'm making the call. Untie him. 
Who's he calling? 
The FBI. 
Now that we're confident the weapon's here, we're calling in the authorities. 
Tony? My cell is down, 
so is the landline. 
Someone's jamming communications. 
It's them. 
They gave me that radio; told me they'd be contacting me. Answer the call. 
Just play along. 
Answer the call. 
Hello? 
Where are you? 
I didn't think you were coming. 
You're late. 
Well, we're here now and we're waiting. 
Okay. 
They're at the front gate. 
Put your belt back on. 
I want you to resume your post. 
Pretend like everything's normal. 
Just let them in. 
And then what? 
We're going to follow them as soon as they pick up their container; once we're past the jamming grid, we'll make our call. 
I don't know. 
What do you mean you don't know? 
You're a part of this, Carl, whether you want to be or not. 
You became a part of it this the second you said "yes" to these people. Jack! 
What do you got? 
I got three vehicles. 
Eight hostiles, heavily armed; got to assume there's more inside the trucks. 
Carl, if you don't open that gate, they're going to come in here looking you, you understand me? 
Let me put it to you this way. 
These men have killed over 300 people today. 
If they get ahold of that weapon, they're going to make that look like child's play. 
You've only got one choice here. 
I just open the gate and let them in. 
That's all you've got to do. 
And you guys got my back, right? Yeah. 
Promise me. 
I promise you. 
Okay. 
Tony, get the surveillance package. 
Don't worry. 
It's just so we can hear what's going on. 
Turn around. 
I need to put this on your back. 
Listen, the money it wasn't about greed or anything. 
It's my wife, Linda. 
She's having twins. 
They say it's the most natural thing in the world, right? 
Getting pregnant? 
Well, it took us three years, cost an arm and a leg. 
No excuses, but insurance doesn't cover a dime. 
I just always wanted to have a family. 
You know what I mean? 
Put this in your pocket. 
You got him? 
Yeah. 
Remember, it's just another day at the office. 
You're going to be fine. 
Let's go. 
What took you so long, Carl? 
You got the routing documents? 
Sure. 
I need to see them in order to locate the container. 
Relax, Carl. 
They're right here. 
Okay. 
Center section. 
Row 36, Q-block. 
It's that fourth stack on your left. 
I know where the container is, Carl. 
Did you disable the security cameras? 
They've been off since 10:00, just like you said. 
How's your wife? 
She's fine. 
You didn't tell her anything about this, did you? 
No, of course not. 
Did you tell anybody else? 
No, no, why would I? 
You tell me, Carl. 
Why are you so nervous? 
Okay, um, you want to know the truth, Mr. Stokes? 
Uh... I was expecting a simple pickup, 
but you show up with a small army here, and, um... 
And what? 
It's just... 
not w-what I was expecting, that's all. 
I just don't want to get caught. 
Nobody's gonna get caught, Carl. 
Let's go, we're moving. 
You too, Carl, take a ride. 
I told you, it's the fourth stack on your left. 
Q-block, row 36. 
I'd feel better if you showed us. 
I really should stay here, Mr. Stokes. 
I got to finish my patrol. 
Why, Carl? 
You expecting somebody? 
No. Then get in. 
Okay. 
Damn it. 
Forget about him, Jack. 
He was dead the minute he stepped out that door. 
You and I both know that. 
Ethan, I just came to say how sorry I am. 
Well, I appreciate the courtesy if not the sincerity. 
As much as I may feel this is what's best for my mother, on a personal level I'm sorry you have to go through this... 
and for some of the harsher things I said to you in anger. 
Well, I suppose I owe you an apology, too, for accusing you of leaking my role in this Bauer fiasco to the press. 
I really believed you were trying to blindside me. 
Considering the impression I gave you, I'm not surprised. 
Olivia, as someone who's known you most of your life, I'd like to offer some advice. 
Of course. 
Ambition can be a valuable quality here in Washington as well as in life, but unchecked, it can be unhealthy, if not dangerous. 
What I'm trying to say is... 
you got yourself a seat at the president's table. 
She listens to you. 
But running a country is not like running a campaign. 
It's not about doing whatever it takes to win. 
It's about doing what's right for the American people. 
Sometimes those things aren't mutually exclusive. 
Well... 
good-bye, Olivia. 
Good-bye. 
MAN: Hello. 
It's Olivia. 
You can go with that story now, Ken, and it just got better. 
Tell me. 
Ethan Kanin's resigning. 
What happened? 
I thought the plan was to let him twist in the wind for a while. 
His hand was forced. Thank you. 
It seems Jack Bauer just murdered Senator Mayer. 
(whispering): What? 
You're kidding me. 
Anybody else have this yet? 
Not yet, it's all yours in time for the 11:00. 
Told you I'd take care of you, didn't I? 
You are too good to me, Olivia. 
You just hold up your end. 
Make sure Kanin's the fall guy. 
My mother is nowhere near this, understand? 
No problem. 
She really doesn't have any idea that you're the leak? 
No, and it'd better stay that way. 
She won't hear it from me. 
When are we having that dinner you promised? 
Maybe next week. 
It's always next week. 
You'd better get to work if you're going to make that broadcast. 
So these files on the computer presumably Senator Mayer was looking at 'em before he was killed? 
Someone was, sir. 
They were opened and viewed within the last hour. 
So if the sen... 
if the senator was killed point-blank in the entry hall, how are we explaining the slugs in the door frame and the railing? 
I don't know, sir. 
Get the crime lab guys on it. 
Yes, sir. 
Agent Walker, it's Larry Moss for you. 
Hello. 
Senator Mayer is dead. 
Where's Jack? 
Don't know; we don't have him. 
Okay, but what, you think that he did this, Larry? 
First Burnett and now Mayer? 
Well... 
it looks that way. 
What do you mean "looks that way"? 
Well, that's why I'm calling. 
Senator Mayer was killed with a UMP 40 submachine gun. 
If Bauer was on the run, where'd he get ahold of a weapon like that? 
Also, there's evidence to suggest that the, uh there was a third party in the house when the senator was killed. 
What kind of evidence? 
Unexplained slugs... 
...a broken set of French doors, 
a chair where it doesn't belong. 
Okay, so are you saying that this third party killed Mayer? 
Well, you know, Renee, I might be saying that if I knew what the hell Bauer was doing here in the first place. 
All right, Renee, listen. 
I want to meet you halfway, I do, but if you expect me to even entertain Bauer's innocence, you have got to help me here. 
I can't, Larry. 
If Jack is still underground, he is underground for a reason. 
There were files open on Mayer's computer documents relating to his investigation into Starkwood. 
All right, so just tell me that, tell me that. 
Did Starkwood ever come up in your conversation with Bauer? 
Renee. 
Look, maybe, maybe I should have trusted you before, okay, but you have got to trust me now. 
What role does Starkwood play in all this? 
The man who framed Jack for Burnett's murder was John Quinn, a Starkwood contractor. 
Jack believes that they were behind Juma and all of the terrorist attacks today. 
He went to Mayer to get the evidence to prove it. 
I have to assume that Quinn followed him there. 
That's all that I know, Larry, I swear. 
Okay, I believe you. 
Thank you. 
Just sit tight, I'll be in touch soon. 
Well, let me help, Larry. 
I mean, Jack could still be out there. 
He may be in trouble. 
No, no, I can't release you, not yet. 
Reese, what's the status? 
Just getting the chassis on, sir, I'll be a minute. 
Hurry it up. 
Hold up, hold up, I don't have my truck. 
Put it down there, I want it there. 
Mitch, get up there. 
Let's run a diagnostic now. 
I want to be ready to roll as soon as Reese gets here with that flatbed. 
Yes, sir. 
All right, there's the package. 
We should get back to the car. 
We want to be in position to follow that container once they move out. 
Jack. 
Just give me one second. 
Cooper. 
Now's as good a time as any to settle up with Carl. 
COOPER: Yes, sir. 
Thanks, Carl. 
Good luck. 
Let's go. 
Where we going? 
Your money's in my truck, just one aisle over. 
Jack, we should get going. 
No. 
What are you doing? 
I thought you said the money was in the truck. 
What the hell's going on? 
Just keep moving. 
Listen, I don't know what Stokes told you, but I didn't tell a soul. 
Damn it, Jack, what the hell are you doing? 
Don't do it. 
You're gonna turn a surveillance job into a firefight. 
It'll be two against ten. 
Two against nine. 
Right, and we lose our best chance at getting this weapon. 
Don't break your own rules. 
You may save one man, but what about the thousands of people who could die in a biological attack? 
Is this about you, Jack, or about them? 
You want to prevent another disaster or ensure that it's going to happen? 
That's far enough. 
Turn around. 
You're going to kill me, you're going to have to look me in the eye. 
Okay. 
Damn it. 
Thank you, thank you. 
We've got about 30 seconds before they figure out what happened. 
Okay, what's our fallback? 
Steal the truck. Strong? 
I'll make the direct assault, you cover the east flank. 
All we need is a big enough firefight to get one of us behind the wheel. 
You ready? Yeah. 
Go. 
How do we look? 
Diagnostics check out, sir. 
The package is stable. 
Good. 
All right, let's get her on the chassis! 
Cooper, come on. 
Let's roll. 
Cooper, do you copy? 
Dolen. 
Check the next aisle over. 
Find Cooper. 
Hold your position. 
Wait for my signal. 
Cooper's down, Cooper's down. 
Go red, go red! 
Let's move out... Greer. 
Engage... engage. 
Reese, get the truck out of here now! 
Go, go, go! 
Tony! 
The truck-- I'm going after it. 
Cover me now! 
Two shooters fan out and find them. 
?? 
Tony, this is Jack do you copy? 
Drop it. 
Tony? 
I know you. 
You're on Emerson's crew. 
You're Almeida, right? 
I know Bauer's with you. 
Now, where is he? 
(phone ringing) Larry Moss. 
Larry, it's Jack. 
Jack, where the hell have you been? 
I need you to scramble multiple teams to a weigh station on Highway 236, exit 29. 
I'm in a big rig about ten miles south. 
What's going on? 
You also need to send a CDC recovery unit. 
Why? 
I'm in possession of a biological weapon interdicted at the Port of Alexandria. 
A biological weapon? 
Larry, just listen to me. 
I don't care if you arrest me. 
I don't care if you shoot me. 
Just get your teams out here. 
I fully expect to be pursued by hostiles. 
Starkwood? 
How do you know about Starkwood? 
I talked to Renee. 
And I saw what was on Mayer's computer. 
Larry, they're coming after this weapon. 
You can count on it. 
Now, be advised, I believe that Tony Almeida is being held hostage. 
All right, I'll call out an interagency alert. 
We'll secure both locations. 
Larry, hurry. 
Damn it! 
Sir, this is Stokes. 
What's your status? 
The package is secure we're inbound. 
What about Bauer? 
He's at the scene, sir, but he sought cover nearby. 
Well, we have to assume that he contacted the authorities, so we better be on an accelerated timetable. 
Get over here. 
It will be there in ten minutes. 
We're right behind. 
Good. 
I've got teams on the ground prepping for your arrival. 
Larry Moss. 
Larry, it's Jack. 
I'm still on Route 236, but I had to stop approximately seven miles before the weigh station. 
Jack, I got two units moving to you right now. 
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to redirect them. 
Why? 
Starkwood reacquired the bioweapon. 
They managed to access one of the dock's freight helicopters. 
While they had me pinned down, they airlifted the freight right out of here. 
They were headed due west from my current position. 
West... they got a large 
military facility in that area. 
Okay, good redirect the teams there. 
Jack, I can't assault a private compound unless I have proof that a weapon exists. 
Okay, where's the CDC? 
They're scrambling a team right now. 
Send them to me. 
You'll have all the proof you need. 
Jack, what happened? 
One of the canisters was breached during the interdiction. 
Some of the bio-agent was released. 
I... 
I was exposed. 
Okay. 
Jack, just sit right. 
CDC's on the way. 
They're going to be there soon. 
This is counel Eka Dubako We have the CIP device We demand the complete withdrawl of the U.S. Naval Strike Force 
by this time tomorrow. 
You are recalling  the invasion force. 
Well, that determination has yet to be made. 
I implore you, do not abandon my country. 
It's Samantha Roth. 
She says  she has new information regarding my son's death. 
Roger was tasked with auditing the brokers in his department. 
He uncovered other blind accounts, accounts that were traced to a senior member of your wife's administration. 
It's all here. 
Account numbers, trading records, everything that he knew. 
Bauer must have worked out this escape with Almeida's people. 
That son of a bitch played me. 
Had me believing the Bureau was compromised someone on the inside working against us. 
I realize now it was him all along. 
MOSS:  He played us both. 
I'm going to make this right, Larry. 
Whatever it takes, I will find Bauer and Almeida. 
You're out of time, Mr. Tanner. 
Tell me what you know. 
I'm not going to tell u a damn thing. 
(groans) Where is Almeida? 
Tanner says Almeida's crew has a plan to abduct former Prime Minister of Sangala. 
Matobo? 
When? 
Pretty much now. 
Why didn't you call the authorities? 
BUCHANAN: He couldn't, Jack. 
Why not? 
He found out Emerson's client was Dubaku. 
That's who you believe has agents inside the government. 
Dubaku is the key to this thing, Jack. 
If we're going to uncover the conspiracy, we have to get to him before he leaves the U.S. 
ALMEIDA: I got away from the FBI. 
Yeah, I heard. 
I also heard it was Jack Bauer who broke you out. 
He's on board now. 
The package is a person. 
EMERSON: Former Prime Minister Matobo of Sangala. 
The assignment is to grab him, deliver him to Colonel Dubaku. 
(explosion) Where's Matobo?! 
Where is he?! 
It's a safe room; reinforced concrete. 
Jack, we leave here without Matobo, we lose our only chance of getting at Dubaku. 
??? 
Matobo's security chief said there's a safe room at his residence. 
They should have him and his wife locked down by now. 
They'll be safe till your team gets there. 
Your priority is to grab Almeida and bring him back here. 
We'll make every effort to use nonlethal force, but Almeida's crew is ex-military. 
They're going to be hard to subdue unless my men can return fire. 
I understand you'll be exposing your men, but it's a risk you need to take. 
Sir... 
Almeida is the only viable lead we've got to retrieve the CIP device. 
You need to bring him in alive, is that understood? 
Understood. 
Let's move out. 
We'll get our updates in the van. 
(pained grunting) Open the safe room. 
(grunts) I will keep going until you open the door. 
(panting): I've already told you. 
Once it's closed, you can only open it from the inside. 
Do whatever you want to me, but you will never get into that room. 
(blows landing, Eto'o grunts) We've got to get Matobo. 
Without him, we've got nothing. 
I know. 
Find a way in yet? 
No. 
Litvak, any luck reconnecting the intercom? 
Not yet. 
I'm working on it. 
(phone ringing) Sir, this just came in... 
I'm in the middle of a field op, Erika. 
I don't really have a lot of time right now. 
It's from the attorney general. 
I think you should make time for this. 
What is it? 
Tanner's lawyers are filing a complaint against the Bureau. 
(speed dialing) (phone rings) Walker. 
MOSS: Renee, it's me. 
I'm less than 15 minutes away from Matobo's house. 
When I get there, I'll recon for the Tac Team. 
Stop a second. 
What? 
This information about Matobo being abducted... 
tell me how you got it. 
You know how I got it I questioned Tanner. 
You questioned him? 
Yeah. 
Tanner's lawyers are saying you locked them out of his hospital room, then cut off his ventilator. 
They said you applied pressure to his gunshot wound. 
We needed Almeida's location. 
Tanner was not about to cooperate. 
So you tortured him. 
What the hell were you thinking? 
I got the information we needed. 
Information that may not even be valid. 
You know as well as I do, coercive interrogation is unreliable. 
No, Tanner was not lying. 
You know that? 
How do you know he wasn't just telling you what you wanted to hear? 
I'll find out when I get to Matobo's house. 
No, you're not going to Matobo's. 
You're coming back here to the office. 
The attorney general is sending somebody here, and you're going to tell him everything that happened. 
Larry... 
it's my fault that Bauer  and Almeida are still at large. 
Please, let me play this out. 
I will deal with the consequences after we find the CIP device. 
No, the field team is on the way, they can handle this. 
Renee, get back here now. 
I'm sorry, Larry, but I need to make this right. 
Renee? 
(turns off phone) Damn it. 
I'm glad you're all right, babe. 
The flight attendant said something about us getting a priority clearance to land. 
Uh, you got lucky. 
Did I? 
I mean, it happened just after we spoke, so I thought maybe you had something to do with it. 
Me? How could I 
have done anything? 
Listen, I might be late tonight. 
There's a lot going on at work. 
I haven't seen you in a week. 
I thought we could spend some time together. 
Dinner, and maybe... 
...you know. 
Sorry, I have to go. 
I have to get back to work. 
Call me later. 
Okay. 
Did you deploy the field teams? 
Yeah, they just left. 
We need to coordinate with Matobo's security chief get him back on the line. 
(keypad beeping) (dial tone drones) (hangs up phone) These people, they work for Dubaku, don't they? 
Possibly. 
Yes, probably. 
But if they wanted me dead, I would be dead. 
Then what do they want? 
Names. 
Names? 
Of my allies inside Sangala. 
You would die before you exposed them, they know that. 
Yes, they do, but.. 
Then it's me. 
It's me. 
They want to use me to get you to ta? 
Don't worry. 
We'll be safe in here until they leave. 
Ule, I'm scared. 
Alama, listen to me. 
We need to stay calm. 
We'll be fine. 
The FBI knows we are here. 
They'll come for us soon. 
Okay? 
EMERSON (over intercom): Mr. Matobo? 
I know you can see and hear me. 
Come out now and nobody has to get hurt. 
You are wasting your time. 
(cocks gun) Come out now or I will kill your man. 
You have one minute. 
Fifty... 
I am prepared to die, sir. 
For you and for Sangala. 
Eto'o is right. 
Without you, Sangala has no leader. 
The people need you. 
30 seconds. 
Eto'o's courage is stronger than your threats. 
He is willing to die. 
And for that sacrifice he has my eternal gratitude, and the gratitude of the people of Sangala. 
Ten seconds. 
Time's up. 
(phone ringing) (phone line ringing) I just got through to him 15 minutes ago. 
Well, he's not answering now. 
Then get me someone else at the residence. 
It's the FBI. 
Does the FBI know we're here? 
Tanner. 
He's the only one who knew we were grabbing Matobo. 
He must have talked. 
Sir, we need to go before they get here. 
Not without Matobo. 
Those walls are two feet thick. 
Even if we blow a hole with a shaped charge, they'll kill everyone inside. 
I think I found a way. 
Yeah? Like what? 
We can gas them out. 
We don't have anything! 
We'll find something! 
There's a ventilation system running straight into the safe room. 
If I can feed the gas through that, it'll flush 'em out. 
LITVAK: The FBI is coming! 
They won't be here for at least 15 minutes. 
What are you talking about? 
How do you know? 
If they knew anything before we got here, they'd have evacuated Matobo. 
That's just guesswork. 
The tac teams are staged out of the DC branch office, That's 21 miles from here,  with traffic. 
That gives us at least 15 minutes. 
We're not leaving without Matobo. 
That's what Dubaku is paying us for. 
You're not seriously considering... 
Shut up! 
What kind of gas are you talking about? 
Ammonium dysterate. 
We can make it from basic household products. 
Do it. 
Tony, give me a hand. 
Jack, you do know ammonium dysterate could kill them as easily as flush them out. 
That's a chance we're gonna have to take. 
Delivering Matobo is our only chance to get to Dubaku and the CIP device. 
I got it. Grab those bowls. 
Gotten into the vent yet? 
Yeah! The fbi will 
be here any minute. 
Mr. Matobo... 
We've accessed the air intake to your safe room. 
We are now feeding in ammonium dysterate gas. 
If you do not open the door you will die. 
I believe that you are willing to sacrifice your life. 
But are you also willing To sentence your wife to death? 
Ule... 
You know what they will do if we open the door. 
I know. 
I can't let them force me to name names. 
Our cause is more important than we are. 
Take my hand. 
 Janis gold? 
 Yes? 
I'm raymond howell From the attorney general's office, Is there some place we can talk? 
About? 
What happened At the hospital, ms. Gold. 
Agent walker's being accused Of torturing your suspect. 
He's not my suspect, i have no idea what happened After i left that room, i am not involved. 
The suspect's attorneys claim that you sent them To the wrong hospital room, To buy agent walker more time. 
So it sounds to me like you were involved. 
This is going to have to wait. 
Janis, i need you on comm, now. 
Agent moss, The a.G. Personally 
initiated this investigation. 
Howell, Open your eyes, we have a situation. 
She cannot deal with this right now. 
Please, Have a seat. Come here. 
What's going on? 
We think almeida and his crew may already at matobo's. 
And we can't reach renee to warn her. 
Why can't you reach her? 
When i heard what she did To tanner, i ordered her back to headquarters To talk to the a.G's office, 
And she, uh, refused, turned off her cell. 
Oh. 
 I need yourunning point On swat. 
 Okay, thanks. 
Hillinger, keep trying to reach renee. 
We're running out of time. 
Put more gas in! 
If we do, it'll kill them instantly. 
How much time is it going to take, jack? 
It's up to them. 
I can't breathe. 
Just close your eyes, let it happen. 
I know if we open that door, it will be worse. 
I love you. 
Alama, no! 
Get him out of there! 
Get the woman, too. 
Just breathe, you'll be all right. 
 Just breathe. 
 Okay, let's go! 
I'm so sorry. 
Let's go. 
 It's moss. 
 Larry, it's renee. 
Renee, listen. 
Bauer and almeida may already be at matobo's. 
Yeah, They are, i've got a visual on them Loading matobo and his wife into a truck. 
Where the hell is swat? 
How long for swat? 
They're still about five minutes out. Renee, listen to me, 
i want you To stand down and fallback until they get there. 
Do you hear me? 
Let me just get a plate on the vehicle. 
Drop the gun. 
Renee? 
Renee? 
Damn it! 
Janis, try getting her back. 
 Whose swat team will be first on scene? 
 Remick's. 
Get him for me, now. 
Move! 
Mr. Emerson! 
Far as i can tell, she's alone. 
Damn you, bauer, you son of a bitch. 
She's fbi. 
Her name is walker. 
She's the one that pulled me Out of the senate hearing to help me find tony. 
Don't be stupid. 
What are you talking about? 
How much does tanner know About your operation? 
Enough to cause problems. 
We need to find out from her what he Told the fbi Till then We do nothing. 
He's right, david. 
We need to be sure nothing else has been compromised. 
Get her in the cage. 
Don't you touch me. 
Get your hands off of me! 
Shut up or i will Shut you up. 
She's clean. 
let's go! 
 Do you have matobo? 
 Yeah. 
And the wife, but we ran Into a complication. 
A complication? 
Fbi knew about the operation. 
Which means tanner talked. 
 I don't like this. 
 No, neither do i. 
We got one of their agents With us, her name's walker. 
I need you to check With your source at the bureau, Find out how much she knows. 
All right. 
If your source doesn't come up all right. With anything, 
we'll interrogate her when we get there. 
Can't believe i trusted you. 
You lying son of a bitch. 
This is important, man. 
To him and me. 
Thanks, appreciate it. 
 Any luck? 
 Yes, sir. 
I'm sorry it took so long, but I tracked down a friend who does crypto for the private sector he says he should be able to crack the files on the thumb-drive. 
Provided the, uh, encryption isn't military grade or better. 
I doubt Roger would have had access to anything like that. 
He also said you'd have a lot easier job if you just went to the NSA. 
Not until we know how badly my wife's administration's been compromised. 
My friend said he'd meet us at his apartment in 20 minutes. 
Do you trust him? 
Yes. 
Samantha says the documents will prove my son was murdered. 
I'll make sure he understands this can't go anywhere. 
Thank you, Brian. 
You don't know what it's been like. 
All this time, knowing in my bones Roger didn't commit suicide, and having people just tolerate me, tell me it was my grief talking. 
I'm going to find the people who did this to my son, Brian. 
And I am going to make them pay. 
Sir, if I ma.. 
What is it? 
Shouldn't you at least tell the President what you're doing? 
I can't take this to my wife... 
until I can prove it. 
You wanted to see me? 
One thing I've learned: presidents don't make new friends. 
That's why they lean on their old ones. 
I'll need your support, Ethan. 
I'm going to authorize the military operation in Sangala as planned. 
Madame President... 
You don't need to list the consequences, Ethan. 
Any action I take in West Africa will likely result in a terrorist attack here, but if I take no action, an entire neration of Sangalans will be wiped out. 
Your critics will point out you took an oath to protect the people of this country. 
And the way to do that is not give in to blackmail and threats. 
Ethan... 
taking a stand against the genocide in Sangala has reestablished our leadership and our moral authority in the eyes of the world. 
I cannot and I will not back down. 
 Yes? 
 Madame President, Secretary of State Stevens is here to see you. It's urgent. 
Send him in. 
What is it, Joe? 
The FBI just reported that Prime Minister Matobo and his wife were abducted from their residence. 
What?! 
Abducted by whom? 
His bodyguards identified Jack Bauer and Tony Almeida as two of the men involved, which means Dubaku has the CIP device and Matobo. 
Where is the FBI on finding him? 
Do they have any active leads? 
Not yet, Madame President. They're just 
beginning the search operation. 
I think we need to talk about how Matobo's abduction affects the invasion. 
Matobo is the only man with enough popular support and strength to lead Sangala after an invasion. 
Without him, the country would collapse in complete bloodshed and chaos. 
Which means the best course of action may be to meet Dubaku's demand  and withdraw our forces. 
The best course of action is to find Matobo and the people who took him. 
And make sure the FBI brings in every relevant agency. 
Yes, ma'am. 
So...  
where do we stand with your decision to go through with the invasion? 
We still have 30 minutes before Dubaku's deadline. 
I want Matobo found by then. 
I just sent you new search coordinates. 
Upload a grid to the ground teams, please. 
I already did  they're adjusting their perimeter now. 
All right, thanks. 
 Listen, Erika. 
 What? 
I'm sorry I was a jerk before. 
You're worried about your wife on a plane. It's cool. 
She's on the ground now. 
Her plane landed; she got lucky. 
That's great news. 
I'm glad she's okay. 
Hey, Sean. 
I can't stop thinking about last night. 
Yeah, me, too. 
Excuse me. 
Sean, I need you to babysit the downloads on my computer. 
They're coming in from the forensics team at Matobo's residence. 
Now, please. 
Okay, sure. 
Excuse me. Remick's team just finished a 
sweep of the Matobo residence. 
He's on line two if you want to talk to him. 
Janis, wait. 
Did you findenee? 
No, sir, but one of Matobo's bodyguards saw her being taken by Bauer and Almeida. 
Then she's alive. 
She's with the Matobos. 
We'll run a trace on her cell. 
Can't do that, sir. 
We recovered Agent Walker's phone and weapon on-site. 
Forensics is still sweeping the scene. 
All right, I want to be the first to know if they find something. 
Yes, sir. 
All right, um... 
get Renee's picture and description out to all agencies. 
Put me in the queue for a real-time update from Homeland. 
Okay. 
Janis. 
I want everybody in this office  to make finding her their top priority. 
Is that understood? 
It is. 
Are you going to be okay? 
What are you talking about? 
Just get to work. 
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you, sir. 
You have nothing to apologize for. 
How much are they paying you, Jack? 
I hope it's enough to live with yourself when they kill innocent Americans with the CIP device. 
Shut up. 
How many people will die because of what you're doing? 
 Emerson. 
 You were right. 
Agent Walker broke Tanner. 
How much did Tanner spill? 
Other than the details of Matobo's abduction, nothing. 
 You're sure? 
 Positive. 
Walker is extraneous. 
Kill her before you get here. 
Okay, we'll be with you soon. 
Be quick about it. 
Dubaku's anxious to get his hands on the prime minister. 
Nichols checked with his source at the Bureau. 
Walker doesn't know anything that can compromise the operation. 
You trust Nichols' source? 
Nichols does. 
That's good enough for me. 
Litvak, change of plan. 
 Take a right on Morrison Avenue. 
 got it What's on Morrison? 
Abandoned construction site we'll dump her there. 
Shouldn't we find out for ourselves what she knows? 
Nichols wants her out of the way??? 
I understand your deployment's stretched thin, but one of our own agents is missing. 
That's a priority, too. 
Look, look, I don't care where you find the men. 
Just get them out there looking. 
I've never seen him like that. 
He looks like his head's going to explode. 
Thank you. 
Well, I'm not surprised. 
 Meaning? 
 Meaning it's fairly obvious he has feelings for Renee. 
Why do you think that? 
Instinct I just know. 
Stay on task. 
General Juma says the American carrier troop still has nobegun to withdraw. 
Well, they haven't launched their invasion either. 
I gave this president a deadline and it's almost past. 
Apparently, our demonstration was not convincing enough. 
This woman is more stubborn than we expected. 
Once she realizes we have Matobo, she'll change her mind. 
And if she doesn't? 
You have the CIP module. 
Launch another attack. 
Let's see how stubborn she is after American civilians start dying. 
 When will Matoboe here? 
 Within an hour. 
What caused the delay? 
An FBI agent got in the way. 
I needed to make sure she hadn't compromised our operation. 
 And has she? 
 No. 
As soon as my men get rid of her, I'll pick up Matobo personally and bring him to you. 
This friend of yours, so you're sure he's going to have everything he needs to access the files? 
He said he didn't think it'd be a problem. 
Thank you, Brian. 
For all your help, and your loyalty. 
You don't need to thank me, sir. 
Yes, I do. 
You're risking a lot to do this, especially after what happened this morning. 
You can thank me after we confirm the information is on that drive. 
Said the key should be under the mat. 
There it is. 
When will your friend be here? 
He should be here any minute. 
Would you mind turning on the air? 
 It's really hot in here. 
 Of course, sir. 
It's Samantha and Roger. 
This is Samantha's apartment, sir. 
You. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
Why? 
Roger was looking into things he shouldn't have. 
I tried to protect him, too, but he wouldn't let me. 
inherited your determination. 
You killed my son. 
You... 
killed Roger. 
It's Tetradyzine, sir. 
It's a neuromuscular paralytic. 
Don't try to speak, the Tetradyzine also paralyzes your vocal chords. 
If it's any consolation, sir, Roger died quickly. 
And I'm going to make sure... 
you do, too. 
Situation here is in control. 
 Are you tracking Ms. Roth? 
 Yeah. 
Time to get her back to her apartment. 
 Are you sure this is going to work? 
 It'll work fine. 
Mr. Taylor came to her apartment 
to confront her about Roger. 
Lost his temper, killed her. 
Took his own life, okay? 
All right. 
I'll let you know if there are any problems. 
I really am sorry, sir. 
If only you'd left well enough alone. 
 Ms. Roth. 
 Agent Vossler. 
Henry Taylor sent me. 
Mr. Taylor's been looking into 
the matter you discussed. 
He believes you're in imminent danger. 
My God... 
What am I supposed to do? 
He wants me to place you in protective custody. 
Escort you to a safe house. 
 Now? 
 My orders are to take you there immediately. 
We can stop at your apartment first, so you can pack clothes, essentials. 
Uh, I just need to call my office. 
Not until we get you locked down, ma'am. 
Please. 
Okay. 
??? 
So it looks like your friend from the A.G. is still here. 
 I know. 
 What's going on? 
He wants to me about what Renee did to Tanner in the hospital. 
What did Renee do to Tanner at the hospital? 
I don't know, but Howell is claiming she tortured Tanner. 
Renee? 
I don't believe that. 
Maybe you should. 
Tanner wasn't talking... 
and she kicked me out of the room. 
And then the next thing I know, the alarm on his ventilator is going off. 
And Renee had the information she needed? 
Mm-hmm. 
If you weren't in the room, you don't have a problem. 
I do, actually-- she asked me to stall his lawyers. 
And you did? 
 Yes. 
 Come on, Gold. 
What were you thinking? 
She gave me a direct order what was I supposed to do? 
Say no. 
Do you realize if they prove that Renee tortured him you're an accessory? 
And Larry is not gonna protect you. 
I know. 
Let's just hope the A.G. will have moved on 
to something else when this is all over. 
I'm getting back to work. 
Agent Moss. 
 What do you want? 
 Forgive my interruption, but it's just been brought to my attention that Agent Walker is missing. 
Yes, she may have been abducted by the same people responsible for kidnapping Matobo and his wife. 
I'm very sorry to hear that. 
And want you to know that I appreciate the enormous pressure that you and the Bureau are under. 
Glad to hear it. 
Nevertheless, the Attorney General is still pressing for a full account of Agent Walker's handling of the Tanner interrogation, and at this moment, Janis Gold is the only witness available to me. 
She's not available to you, Howell. 
I already told you, she can't be spared right now. 
 I only need a short time with her. 
 You can't have her. 
Are you going to force me to get the A.G. on the line? 
You've got to be kidding me. You really 
want to press this right now?! 
We're in the middle of an international crisis. 
 I'm aware of that. 
 And all you seem interested in is condemning the actions of an agent who's in God-knows-what danger  just so you can nail her to the wall. 
If Agent Walker broke federal guidelines and used illegal tactics to get information, then, yes, she will be prosecuted. 
Then maybe you can let us get her back first before you throw her to the wolves, I mean, if that's okay with you. 
 Yes? 
 Larry? 
NSA just relayed a call they intercepted to us. 
Renee was referenced. 
Referenced how? 
Janis? 
I think you need to come hear it yourself. 
I'll be right there. 
Excuse me. 
We're not done here. 
Agent Moss! 
 Did you source it? 
 Five minutes ago. It's legit. 
Check it again. 
I already did, twice. 
Where's the intercept code? 
Right there above the decryption algorithm. 
They routed it to us on a priority channel. 
Were we able to get verbal confirmation? 
It's not going to change the content of the call, Janis. 
I know, I just... 
What's on the NSA intercept? 
What? You said Renee 
was referenced. What's on it? 
It's only a fragment, but she's referenced, yeah. 
Enough to get a GPS fix? 
The clip's not even 27???seconds long. 
The best we can say is that it's in the Metro area. 
Play it. 
 Emerson  you were right, Agent Walker broke Tanner. 
How much did Tanner spill? 
Other than the details of Matobo's abduction, nothing. 
 You're sure? 
 Walker is extraneous. 
Kill her before you get here. 
We'll be with you soon. 
Be quick about it. 
Dubaku's anxious to get his hands on the Prime Minister. 
When was this call made? 
Ten minutes ago. 
 Run a trace. 
 I already did. 
Run it again! 
Jack. 
The ditch. 
Kill her. 
Yeah. 
Tony. 
Step down. 
Step down! 
You could either walk or I could drag you. 
You're really going to kill me? 
 I'm not going to beg for my life, Jack. 
 Good. 
So everything that you told me was a lie? 
I'm doing what I have to. 
I don't expect you to understand. 
I understand that you are a traitor and a murderer. 
Turn around. 
No. 
You're going to have to look at me when you pull that trigger. 
I said turn around. 
If you trust me, I will get you through this alive. 
Get on your knees. 
For a second there, I didn't thk you were going to do it. 
Now bury her. 
We're on a timetable. 
Can't have anyone finding the body before we're out of the country. 
Give him a hand, Tony. 
You son of a bitch. 
You're behind my son's death. 
 Madam President, I have your husband. 
You will have your forces withdrawn from around my country, Sangala... 
immediately and permanently... 
or your husband will die a slow and certain death. 
I just wanted to make sure that you were still coming to dinner tonight. 
Marika, I can't. 
I'll make it up to you. 
If you're looking for Marika, she's not with me. 
I'm looking for you, Samuel, or whatever your real name is. 
Now, I don't know who you really are and I don't care. 
I just want you out of my sister's life. 
Keep an incident quiet until whatJack and I are doing goes down. 
 What incident? 
 Vossler's dead. 
Jack killed him at the hotel on 18th and Reagan. It was self-defense. 
Damn it, Renee. 
What the hell are you doing with this guy? 
We're supposed to bring suspects in, not murder them. 
Until we know who Dubaku's source is, you've got to handle this outside of the Bureau. 
Dubaku is the only person with the names... 
of the people who betrayed you within your government. 
It's imperative that we find him. 
You resigned from government service... 
and the Senate regards you as having been a renegade agent. 
How am I supposed to know where your loyalties really lie? 
With all due respect, Madam President, ask around. 
I got an address for Henry Taylor. 
Get an ambulance! 
 The following takes place between 4:00 p.m. And 5:00 p.m. 
No one else gets through here. 
Follow me. 
It's Henry Taylor, the president's husband. 
 But that information is not to be disseminated. Clear? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 L  Mr. Taylor, don't speak. 
I need you to save your energy. 
Over here! 
Excuse me. 
Step back, please! 
This is Unit Six. 
We got a gunshot trauma to the chest. 
 Ninemillimeter round. 
 Ninemillimeter, substernal. 
 Pulse is rapid. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm gonna call the president. 
I want you to search all the rooms. 
See if you can get anything off their hardware that's gonna tell us where Dubaku went. 
  President Taylor's office. 
 This is Jack Bauer. 
 I need to speak with the president. 
 One moment, please. 
Madam President, I would encourage you not to lose hope. 
Dubaku knows that we tried to deceive him, Ethan. He has no reason to keep Henry alive. 
    Madam President, Jack Bauer's on line one. 
Put him through. 
Mr. Bauer, this is President Taylor. 
Madam President, we have your husband. 
He's alive, but he sustained a gunshot wound to the chest. 
How bad is it? 
E.M.T. Are stabilizing him. 
They're getting ready to transfer him to West Arlington Hospital. 
Mr. Bauer, be more specific. 
Is my husband going to be okay? 
We're not gonna know anything until the doctors see him. 
Ma'am, I have to warn you. 
He has lost a lot ofblood. 
Jack, it's Bill. 
Do you have Dubaku? 
Negative. 
He was gone before we got here. 
Madam President, since your husband was the only leverage that Dubaku had left... 
it's safe to say that he's trying to leave the country now. 
Have you any idea how he intends to do that? 
Not at this time. Unfortunately, 
all his men were killed during the assault. 
Agent Walker and I will stay behind. 
We'll continue to search the area. 
We have to assume that Dubaku has an exit strategy already in place. 
Whatever we're gonna do to find him, we're gonna have to do it fast. 
Yes. 
Thank you, Mr. Bauer. 
Please keep me apprised on everything. 
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry. 
I am so sorry, Madam President. 
Ethan, I'm going to the hospital to be with my husband. 
Ma'am, that's not possible. 
You're executing a military invasion. 
My generals can execute it perfectly well without me. 
We can't ignore the fact the Secret Service has been compromised. 
There's no way we can ensure your safety outside the White House. 
I don't give a damn. 
I am not gonna be held prisoner in this office... 
while my husband is fighting for his life. 
Now either find someone to take me to the hospital, or I'll drive there myself. 
Madam President, you know my record of service. 
If it's acceptable to you, I'm willing to assume responsibility for your security. 
Bill, you're no longer credentialed. 
You don't have the authority. 
Until we capture Dubaku and interrogate him... 
we have no idea who in the government is working for him. 
 You do not know who you can trust. 
 But I can trust you? 
I brought this conspiracy to your attention, Madam President. 
I would hope that I've earned it. 
What do you need from me? 
Reinstate my government clearance... 
allow me the authority to vet White House staff... 
and allow me to bring one of my own people into F.B. I... 
to provide Larry Moss with tactical support. 
 Who is it that you want to bring in? 
 Chloe O'Brian. 
I can vouch for her. 
She's the best there is. 
Her clearances were also revoked when C.T.U. Was decommissioned. 
Isn't there anyone capable of handling these duties without our having to reinstate her? 
Someone in the Bureau is on Dubaku's payroll. 
Until we find out who it is... 
Larry Moss can't take the chance of bringing his own people into a manhunt for Dubaku. 
All right. 
The director of White House Secret Service operations is Agent Hovis. 
I'll order him to turn over security protocols to you. 
I know Ted Hovis, Madam President. 
He's not gonna like this. He's gonna fight us. 
Considering that agents under his charge are responsible for what happened to my husband... 
I don't give a damn what he likes. 
You have your provisional appointment, Mr. 
Buchanan, under the authority of this office. 
 Thank you, Madam President. 
 You can thank me by getting me to the hospital. 
I'll make the arrangements. 
 Madam President  Your concerns are clear to me, but I've made my decision. 
I'm only trying to do my job, looking out for your interests. 
My interest right now is catching Ik� Dubaku. 
He has killed scores of Americans today... 
he tried to kill my husband, and he has corrupted our government. 
Whatever it takes, I want that son of a bitch found. 
Marika! Marika! 
 Samuel? What are you doing here? 
 We need to talk. 
 Uh, okay. Well, I get a break in 20 minutes. 
 No, now. 
 Come. 
 What is it? You're scaring me. 
Uh, something has come up. 
I need to leave the country. 
 What? When? 
 Right away. 
I don't understand. 
When are you coming back? 
Marika, listen to me. 
I haven't been entirely honest with you. 
My passport visa expired a couple of months ago, and I've been in the country illegally. 
I'm afraid the Immigration people have caught up with me. 
It was my sister, wasn't it? 
 She reported you, didn't she? 
 That doesn't matter now. 
What is important is, I have to leave the country tonight and I want you to come with me. 
 Tonight? 
 Marika, we've talked about this. 
I promised that one day I would take you away from here, give you the happiness you deserve. 
Samuel, I want that too, but but not tonight, not so soon. 
Marika! Marika, I don't 
have time to argue with you! 
I'm sorry. 
I can't leave Rosa. 
I mean, she needs me. 
I'm the only one she has to take care of her. 
You know that. 
I know. I know. 
 Which is why she's going to join us. 
 Join us? 
As soon as possible. 
I could only arrange tickets for both of us tonight. 
But I want you to promise not to tell your sister of our plans, at least not yet. 
 I have to. I can't just run off. 
 No. No, no. 
She might cause trouble for us, make it impossible for us to leave. 
Look, I promise you... 
your sister will join us within a couple of days of our arrival. 
 Okay? 
 Our arrival where? 
Belize. I have shown you 
the photographs of my home there. 
Do you love me? 
You know I do. 
Then trust me. 
Say you'll come. 
I'll get my things. 
Now, I still need to finalize our arrangements. 
I want you to go home and pack. 
Wait for my call. 
All right. 
   Yes? 
It's me. Have you 
made the preparations? 
Almost. It's been tricky 
clearing a flight corridor... 
since F.A.A. Still has most private 
and commercial aircraft grounded. 
I have faith you'll manage. 
 The arrangements are for two passengers. 
 Just as you requested. 
Are you sure you want to leave now, Colonel? 
Can't imagine GeneralJuma will be pleased to learn that you're abandoning your mission. 
Mission is over. 
I have done what I can do. 
If that is not enough forJuma, then to hell with him. 
Got your passports and itinerary in hand. 
We meet at our usual spot in half an hour. 
I'll bring them. 
No. We meet in the lobby of 
the Roosevelt Continental Hotel. 
That's not a good idea. 
It'll be crowded there at this hour. 
I know. 
I want to make it earlier. 
I'll see you in 15 minutes. 
Go. 
Can't get it to boot. 
Hard drive must be fried. 
Let's search the bodies. 
Start with him. 
 Yeah? 
 Renee, it's me. 
Bill Buchanan just briefed me on your situation. 
What's Henry Taylor's status? 
We got him in an ambulance en route to West Arlington Hospital. 
I don't know his current condition. 
Buchanan told me you and Bauer were in a firefight. 
Yeah. We took down six of Dubaku's men, 
but Dubaku was gone before we got there. 
 You all right? 
 Been in worse. 
You sure? 
 I'm fine, Larry. 
 Really? 
I'm not so sure about that. 
And what is that supposed to mean? 
I'm looking at a report faxed to me from Metro Police. 
A Mrs. Carol Vossler is claiming 
an unidentified woman... 
held her and her child hostage at gunpoint. 
 She says the woman threatened to kill her son. 
 Larry, we discussed this. 
We needed to get Vossler to tell us where Taylor was being held. It was the only leverage we had. 
Yeah. Right. 
Whatever's necessary. 
Jack Bauer's rationalization for every unethical action he takes. 
Well, it worked, Larry. 
Doesn't that count for something? 
Renee, Jack Bauer is about to be strung up by a Senate subcommittee... 
and you are following his playbook. 
You got the A.G. Office looking into that thing 
you pulled with Tanner's respirator. 
 And now this. 
 No one was actually hurt. 
 No one   Renee, Bauer killed the woman's husband! 
Renee, I swear to you here... 
I am scared of what is happening to you. 
You put these people through hell, and it doesn't bother you. 
I didn't say that it doesn't bother me, Larry. 
I said that it worked. 
Of course it bothers me. 
I can see that woman's face... 
she and her child staring at me with such She had no idea that her husband was a killer, a traitor to his country... 
and she looked at me like I was the monster. 
 Agent Walker. 
 Hold on. 
I cross-referenced the information on these P.D.A.'s. 
I came some across banking transactions all from a series of accounts registered to the same address. 
 You think it's a safe house? 
 It's worth a shot. 
Larry, we may have an address on Dubaku. 
21917 Euclid Street, Apartment 6. 
21917 Euclid Street, Unit 6. 
We're moving out now. 
Can you provide sat surveillance? 
Yeah. Bill Buchanan's sending 
somebody over to run tech. 
But until she's up and running, you're gonna have to go in blind. 
 Okay. We'll be in touch. 
 You sure you're okay? 
Fine. 
Let's go. 
We're back with Lila Lee... 
talking about her wonderful book, Recipes from My Family: A Living Genealogy. 
Thank you for coming on the show today. 
Oh, it's my pleasure, Pam. I mean, 
it has been quite a journey to this moment. 
I had no idea that what I started would end up here. 
 You were telling us earlier that this just started... 
as gathering recipes and traditions that you remembered when you were growing up. 
 That's right. You know, 
I was trying to tell my children... 
as I would make them lunch, I was reminded of where did this recipe come from. 
Then as I did that, I remembered, well, this was my grandmother's  Federal investigations continue into the terrorist acts... 
that have gripped the nation's capital... 
as well as the people of Kidron, Ohio. 
 Despite assurances by President Taylor... 
 Hey, sweetie. 
That the threat has passed... 
sources at the White House will not confirm... 
that all those responsible have been accounted for. 
 Now you sure you're not gonna need my help? 
I'm just running F.B.I. Ops temporarily 
until they catch Dubaku. 
Once they find him, hopefully he'll tell us the names... 
of all the people on his payroll that are inside our government. 
 And then we can go home? 
 Then we can go home. 
Well, just be careful. 
All right? 
Because if Buchanan's right and Dubaku has someone working inside the Bureau I'll watch my back. 
You just watch Prescott. 
Hey, sweetheart, Mommy has to go to work. 
You be good, okay? 
Bye, Mommy. 
 You be good too. 
 I will. 
Bye. 
And if you get all jammed up, you know where to find me. 
  I.D., please. 
 Chloe O'Brian. 
All right, go ahead. 
Need you to cross-reference our deployments with Homeland. 
Make sure the requisition numbers match up. 
 After that, you can catch up on the hourlies. 
 Are you joking? 
That is busy work, administrative crap you're handing me. 
Janis, I don't have the time nor the inclination right now to explain my assignments to you. 
 Just get it done. 
 Agent Moss. 
 Chloe O'Brian just cleared security. 
She's on her way up. 
 All right. Thank you. 
Janis, set up a secure V.P.N. Socket, 
port it to the conference room. 
Why do you need a V.P.N. Socket? 
I'm bringing in a consultant from Homeland... 
to confirm there are no lingering gaps in the C.I.P. Firewall. 
That's fine. 
Take that downstairs. 
Ms. O'Brian. Larry Moss. 
 Welcome to the F.B.I. 
 Hi. 
 You can call me Chloe. 
 We're right in here. 
 Buchanan said you'd be up to speed? 
 I'm up. 
Good. Agent Walker and Bauer 
are pursuing a potential lead on Dubaku. 
They're en route to this address in the Mount Pleasant district. 
Agent Walker's requesting satellite support. 
What's the matter? 
Is something wrong? 
I'm feeling a little exposed here. 
If someone out there is working for Dubaku, shouldn't we be doing this more covertly? 
As far as anyone knows, you're working on shoring up our firewall. 
Besides, this is the only space available where you'll have full access to our server. 
 Our network doesn't support remote modules. 
 That's inefficient. 
Whoever set your network up that way didn't know what they were doing. 
I set our network up that way. 
Oh. Okay. 
Something else? 
You worked with Bauer for a long time, didn't you? 
Seven years, on and off. 
That's impressive. 
That you survived the experience. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Only that a lot of people didn't. 
Curtis Manning, Ryan Chappelle, his own wife. 
Are you saying it's Jack's fault his wife was killed? 
You tell me. 
Jack Bauer is the most trustworthy, honorable man I know, and he's my friend. 
Maybe you should worry less about him and more about the mole in your office... 
working for Dubaku. 
Is that Chloe O'Brian? 
 What? 
In the conference room Chloe O'Brian. 
She was senior analyst at C.T.U. 
I once took a seminar she gave. 
What's she doing here? 
Larry said Homeland sent her to check for residual breaches from the firewall attack. 
 Huh. 
 What? 
It just doesn't sound like her area of expertise. 
Besides, as far as I know, she's been inactive since C.T.U. Was decommissioned. 
Passports and travel itinerary. 
Hawker Siddeley 748 is fueling at Taft Airfield. 
Be ready to fly within a half hour, get you to the Cayman Islands. 
Shouldn't have any trouble getting to Belize from there. 
I need a car to the airfield and a driver. 
I assumed you had your own transportation. 
 It's not for me. 
 I see. It's for the girl. 
Well, I'm not sure I can find someone I trust on such short notice. 
Really? 
 What about your man at the bar? 
 Excuse me? 
Or one of the two on the balcony watching us now? 
Or the two in the black Town Car, waiting for me to leave? 
Do you think I'm a fool, Mr. Burnett? 
I know you people see me as a liability now. 
These men are here to guarantee your safety, Colonel, not to threaten it. 
Guarantee my safety. 
How nice. 
And said with such sincerity. 
I want you to take this message back with you. 
If anything should happen to me on my way out of the country an accident or an assassination attempt, anything the plane that you were so generous to donate decides to explode a data file with all the names and bank transactions of all those involved... 
will be sent to theJustice Department. 
That is completely unnecessary. 
Same holds true if anything should happen to Marika Donoso. 
I swear to you she knows nothing of this. 
She's no threat to you. 
Make sure your driver knows this before he brings her to me. 
Do you understand what I am saying? 
I want you to tell me that you understand... 
what I am saying to you, so there will be no mistakes. 
 I understand. 
 Good. 
The one thing I have learned in the company of mercenaries, Mr. Burnett... 
is that ultimately they care about nothing but their own survival. 
Good day. 
   I was right. Dubaku suspected 
we were gonna take him out. 
And apparently he's assembled evidence to use as an insurance policy. 
We need to make sure he gets out of the country... 
and safely into exile, otherwise we're all compromised. 
I'll make the calls. 
What are you doing? 
 Rosa. 
 Where are you going? 
Rosa, listen to me. 
We're going away from here, all of us. 
Well, what do you mean, "all"? 
Samuel told me the truth. 
He's an illegal, just like you thought. 
He has to leave the country, and I've agreed to go with him. 
 You're leaving me? 
 No, no. Only for a short time. 
You're gonna come too. 
Samuel's made plans. We're gonna 
live with him in his home in Belize. 
Marika, he's lying to you. 
 He's not. 
 I won't let you do this! 
My God, Rosa! 
I have taken care of you my entire life! 
I've sacrificed everything for you. 
 Why can't you let me have this? 
 I don't trust him! 
Well, you've never liked any man who's ever shown any interest in me. 
Every chance I've ever had at happiness, you've found some way of ruining it. 
 But not this time. 
 Marika, I'm begging you. Listen to me. 
 No. 
 Marika, please. Stop. 
 Move! 
 Marika, please. 
Listen to me. 
I'm begging you, Marik  F.B.I. Don't move! 
 Get on your knees now! On your knees! 
Both of you, put your hands behind your head and interlock your fingers! Now! 
Do not move! 
We're clear. 
 Where is Dubaku? 
 Who? 
Don't play games with me! Ik� Dubaku! 
We traced bank accounts to this address. 
 Now, where is he? 
 We don't know whwho you talking about. 
Let me try and make this easier for you. 
You know this man? 
No. 
You're lying to me. 
Why are you lying to me? 
L-Let me see. 
That's him. 
We know him. 
He calls himself Aboa. 
Samuel Aboa. 
 Rosa, shut up! 
 She was going to meet him to leave me. 
 Where were you gonna meet him? 
Where were you going? 
 I don't know. 
 How do you know him? You work for him? 
 No. 
 Do you work for him? 
 No. 
You know what he's doing here in this country? 
Do you have any idea... 
what this man is? 
He's everything to me. 
Notify C.P. Iocation. Will hold. 
Once the floor's secure. 
 Nurse  Mitchell. 
Nurse Mitchell, I'd like to see my husband. 
Ma'am, I don't know if that's possible. 
I was told that Dr. Schulman 
will be doing the surgery. Where is he? 
Excuse me, Madam President. 
I'm Lee Schulman, your husband's surgeon. 
If you come with me you can see him now, but you'll need to keep it brief. 
Thank you. 
You should know Mr. Taylor's looking 
at a minimum of five hours in surgery. 
The bullet lacerated his pulmonary artery... 
and lodged in his thoracic region. 
He's also suffered massive internal bleeding. 
Can you offer any kind of prognosis? 
I'm a blunt woman, Dr. Schulman. 
I appreciate bluntness. 
His chances aren't good, ma'am... 
but I'll do everything I can. 
If you'll excuse me, I need to scrub up now. 
Henry! 
 Darling, can you hear me? 
 Ally. 
Yes, sweetheart. 
I'm here. 
I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you about Roger. 
You were right. It wasn't suicide. 
I know that now. 
You were always right. 
  He was a hero. 
 Yes. 
He was. 
And so are you. 
I'm sorry, Madam President, but the anesthesiologist is ready now. 
    Mr. Carlisle, 
come to Admitting, please. 
Mr. Buchanan. 
Yes, Madam President? 
There's something I need you to do for me. 
Have someone find my daughter Olivia and bring her to me. 
Have you had a chance to tell her? 
My daughter and I haven't spoken for some time, Mr. Buchanan. 
She'd never get on the phone with me. 
She works for a consulting firm Martlin Norris. 
Do you have someone trustworthy you can send? 
Yes, ma'am. I believe I do. 
And here he is again, in the uniform of the presidential guard... 
at the gates of the notorious Mukatu Prison. 
And here, inside the soccer stadium after the Barakar Massacre... 
the event that earned him the nickname the Butcher of Sangala. 
Oh, please. 
No more. 
What did you say his real name was again? 
Dubaku. 
Ik� Dubaku. 
I've seen firsthand what he's capable of. 
I was in Africa a few months ago. He was 
responsible for murdering a friend of mine. 
Oh, God. 
I know this is a shock... 
and I'm sorry, I really am. 
But here's the situation we need your help and we need it now. 
   What kind of help? 
We need to put this man in custody before he can leave the country. 
She already told you she doesn't know where he is. 
You said earlier that you were gonna meet him. Where? 
He didn't say. Just told me to go home 
and pack and wait for his call. 
Give me your phone. 
 Why? 
 When he calls, I want you to answer. 
 No. No, no. I can't. I can't. 
 Yes, you can. 
   Listen to me. Just listen to me. 
L- It's over. 
The man you thought you knew, the man you had feelings for, he doesn't exist. 
All you've been left with are his lies and his betrayal. 
Is that him? 
   Marika, please. 
All I want you to do is answer the phone and talk to him... 
so that we can find out where he wants to meet you. 
 Please, you can do this. 
  Please just try. 
   Hello? 
  Marika? 
 Yes. 
 Are you all right? 
 I'm fine. 
What took you so long to answer the phone? 
I was in the bedroom, packing. 
Where are you? 
What's wrong? 
You sound strange. 
It's- It was Rosa. 
She caught me packing and we argued. 
 Is she going to be a problem for us? 
 No! 
I'm sorry, Samuel. 
I had to tell her everything. 
It was the only way. 
But, uh- But she understands now. 
 Are you certain? 
 Yeah. 
Yeah, she's fine, now that she knows she and I will be together again in a few days. 
Hmm. She should thank heaven 
she has such an angel for a sister. 
 Are you ready to go? 
 Almost. 
Hurry up then. I've had a car sent for you. 
It should be there very shortly. 
Go downstairs and wait for it. 
 Where is it taking me? 
 Don't worry. The driver will know. 
I just want the woman I love to get downstairs as quickly as possible. 
Okay. 
It's all right. 
It's all right. 
 You did great. 
 Did we get the rendezvous point? 
No. He's sending a car 
with a driver. 
Come here. 
There's no one on the street yet. 
We could grab the driver, get him to tell us Dubaku's location. 
There's no guarantee we can get him to talk... 
and if we take too long, Dubaku's not gonna wait around. 
So then what do we do? 
We can get her to go meet with him. 
What? 
We could track her. We could use 
her cell phone as a transponder. 
 You want to send that girl to Dubaku? 
 We don't have another choice. 
 Jack. 
 You want to get Dubaku? This is our shot. 
Marika... 
I have a favor to ask of you. 
We can't make you do this, but when the car arrives... 
we would like you to go with the driver so that we could follow you back to Dubaku. 
What are you talking about? 
You want her to go to him and face him? 
It's the only chance we have of finding him before he disappears forever. 
I'll do it. 
 I'll do it. 
 No! I'm your older sister, 
and I won't allow it! 
It's not your decision to make, Rosa. It's mine. 
And it's the right thing to do. 
Let me see your phone. 
 What are you doing? 
 Getting your S.I.D. Number. 
That's how we're gonna track you. 
You're not gonna be out there alone. 
Agent Walker and I will be following you. 
We'll never be more than a mile behind. 
As soon as you reach the destination, that's when we'll move in. 
Marika, a mile. 
Are you crazy? 
Rosa, enough. 
You heard what he said! 
He's a murderer! 
 He could hurt you! 
 He won't. 
Rosa, I should've listened to you. 
 Sweetheart. 
 You warned me about him. 
Listen, the only reason why I said those things was because I was jealous... 
and I didn't want to lose you. 
Larry, this is Jack. Renee said you had 
someone running operations support? 
 Yeah, she's right here. I'll put you on speaker. 
  Jack, it's Chloe. 
 Chloe. 
 What do you need? 
How long's it gonna take you to set up a sat beacon for a mobile line? 
Usually a few seconds, but with the backward way they have this system set up... 
it's gonna take at least a few minutes. 
Okay. Let me give you the S.I.D. Number: 
1 -C-4-8-6-8-9. 
 You got it? 
 Got it. 
Jack, who are you tracking? 
A woman who's involved with Dubaku. 
He's sending a car to take her to him. 
 She's one of his operatives? 
 No. 
It's more complicated than that. 
Arthur, you're not going to find another firm that's done more high-level consulting work... 
for a relatively small pharmaceutical company like yours. 
Remember, my firm helped the governor craft a plan... 
to swap property taxes for sales taxes in his last budget reform. 
Tell me that didn't save Dexter Carr a bundle. 
Oh, it did, Olivia. 
But since I'm specifically looking to hire you, I need to know what you yourself can do. 
Whatever you need. You know my 
accomplishments. You've seen my r�sum�. 
I mean White House influence... 
considering your family. 
We're not lobbyists, Arthur. 
It states that clearly in the contract. 
I just thought since you have the president's ear I don't. Is that 
going to be a problem? 
Excuse me. Ms. Taylor? 
Do I know you? 
My name is Aaron Pierce. 
Your office told me you'd be here. 
I've been dispatched at the request of the president. 
Your credentials say you've retired, Mr. Pierce. 
Perhaps no one informed you I refused Secret Service protection months ago. 
I'm aware of that, ma'am. 
This is a special circumstance. 
Well, as you can see, I'm a little busy right now. 
 This isn't a good time. 
 I'm sorry, but I have to insist. 
 Really, it's all right. 
 No. 
No, it's not all right. 
What is it that's so important for my mother to steal me away while I'm trying to do business? 
I'm not at liberty to say, ma'am. 
That information is confidential. 
Olivia, we can pick this up at a later time. 
 Arthur, wait. It 
 We'll be in touch. 
Ma'am, please. 
I'm not going anywhere with you until you tell me what this is about. 
It's your father, Ms. Taylor. 
He's been shot. 
He's in surgery at West Arlington Hospital. 
Your mother's there now. 
None of this is public knowledge. 
My God. L 
My car is just outside. 
Excuse me, Sean. Can I please 
get the digital beta key for the server? 
Why? 
Larry asked for it. Something to do 
with the firewall assessment. 
 If Larry wants it, why doesn't he come to me? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe I oughta go ask him. 
 No. 
Okay. 
I think that Larry brought in this woman, Chloe O'Brian, to replace me... 
and I just want to get a bead on what they're working on, that's all. 
That's all? That's enough 
to lose us both our jobs. 
 Well, maybe I should stop covering for you. 
 What are you talking about? 
Erika and you and your little sexual indiscretions? 
I've said nothing to Larry or your wife. 
I'm sure you'd like me to keep it that way. 
You're a little bitch, you know that? 
You're a little bitch. 
 Okay, Jack. The link's up. I've got the signal. 
  Copy that. I'll get back to you. 
We're on. 
I'll be all right. 
Marika, we gotta go. 
Okay. 
You. F.B.I. 
You keep her safe, you hear me? 
We will. 
I'm really scared. 
You're gonna be fine. 
Just remember, we're right behind you. 
 Hold up here. 
 Okay. 
Now, listen, if you get into trouble, you can signal us by dialing 10 No. No, I don't want you to do that. 
Don't do anything that's gonna raise the suspicion of the driver. 
 Okay. 
 You ready? 
 I'm ready. 
 Okay. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 She was scared. 
I wanted her to know there was another option than waiting for us to swoop in. 
If we're gonna find Dubaku, there are no other options. 
You understand? 
Come on. You've run operations like this. 
Not without full tactical support and at least two backup units in the scene. 
 She's naked out there, Jack. I don't like it. 
 This isn't about you. 
This is about her and Dubaku. 
Listen, life gets ugly. 
Innocent people get hurt. 
That's a reality. 
At least she got to make a choice to be involved, to do the right thing... 
which is a lot more than I can say for Dubaku's other victims. 
We have one job here that's to get Dubaku. 
Outside of that, don't get involved. 
Chloe, the car's here. 
Copy that. 
She's getting in the car. 
Copy. 
She's moving. 
Are you locked in? 
Yeah. I've got them 
heading south on 14th. 
Can you upload the tracking grid to Agent Walker's P.D.A. 
 No. I'll have to direct you. 
 Just keep us close. 
Understood. 
Head towards 14th, make a right. 
Copy that. 
How much further? 
Continuing west on R Street, crossing Hampshire Avenue. 
 You're less than a mile behind the target car. 
  Copy that. 
Target car is turning left on Connecticut. 
Okay. Rounding Dupont Circle. 
Agent Moss, is there anything in the northern quad of the grid... 
that would indicate where Dubaku could hide a plane or a helicopter? 
 No. Nothing definitive. 
It could be any number oflaunch sites. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
What was that? What happened? 
 Jack, we've got a problem. 
 Chloe, what's wrong? 
We just lost the tracking grid. 
 What? 
 I don't know. It just glitched out. 
We can't afford to lose them, Jack. 
I gave this woman my word we'd protect her. 
 I know. Chloe, get it back up. 
  We're doing our best, Jack. 
Wait. It's back up. 
 What the hell happened? 
 I don't know. I'm running a diagnostic right now. 
Jack, they're moving southeast on Massachusetts Avenue. 
You've closed the gap to about a half a mile. 
You may wanna back off a little bit. 
 Okay. Copy that. 
 Oh, no. 
  What? 
 Somebody was in the system. 
What? What are you talking about? 
I'm saying someone in this office was mirroring my terminal. 
Whoever it was knows exactly what we were doing. 
Can you backtrace the breach? 
No. The link was severed. 
It could've come from anywhere. 
Jack, you getting this? 
Looks like we might have a security breach. 
Someone is mirroring our comm. 
Jack. They're coming from all sides. 
Larry, we got a situation here! 
 What's going on? 
 I got Metro P.D. Trying to 
build a roadblock around us. 
 What? 
Why would they be doing that? 
I don't know! 
Just get 'em off us! 
Larry, do something! 
This is Agent Moss. 
Connect me with Metro district command. 
 Hands in the air! Hands in the air! 
 My name is Jack Bauer! 
 Get out of the car! 
 My passenger is a federal agent! 
Get out of the car right now! 
On the ground! 
 She's a federal agent! 
 On the ground! 
 Face down! 
 Keep your hands behind your back, sir! 
Come on, Larry! 
Do something! 
 Captain, you've got to release these people immediately. 
 But we have a federal warrant. 
No! That is a mistake. No federal 
warrants have been issued for them. 
Yes, they have. A warrant 
was called in for the vehicle. 
"Occupants armed and dangerous, to be apprehended with decisive force." 
 Issued by whom? 
 F.B.I. This office. 
There's no attribution, but the routing code's real. 
This was definitely done by someone here. 
Marika's carjust turned east onto N Street. 
Captain, listen carefully. I am 
the special agent in charge of this operation. 
I am revoking these warrants immediately. 
 Sir, you'll have to clear that with command. 
 No. 
No, I don't have time to deal with your chain of command. 
You need to release these people right now! 
Hey, thank you. 
 So, is O'Brian here to replace you? 
 I don't know. No? 
Larry's using her for some kind of covert operation with Jack Bauer. 
They're tracking a car to Dubaku. 
 Why would he keep us in the dark about something like that? 
 I don't know. 
I don't know, but I don't like it. 
 Yes? 
 Hey. I took care of Bauer and Walker. 
They're pinned down. 
Why am I being brought in on this so last-minute? 
Moss is running this op on his own. 
It took me some time to tap into his phone line. 
He's on with Metro right now. 
Can you at least disable the tracking signal they're using to follow the girl? 
No. Not from my console. 
But judging by the frequency, they're using her cell as the tracker. 
All right. Good work. 
You told me that once Dubaku served his purpose, you'd take him out. 
Why are we still helping him? 
He's threatening to expose us using a database he's kept... 
with names and accounts of everyone involved. 
 Including mine? 
 I mean everyone! 
We don't know where the file is, so you just better pray that he gets away. 
Yes. It has to do with the terrorist threats 
that happened this morning. 
   Hello? 
 You got a problem. 
 What is it? 
Your girlfriend's been turned by the F.B.I. 
I don't believe you. 
They met with her a half hour ago, told her who you really are. 
That's impossible. 
 Marika would never do this. 
 I got it from my source inside the Bureau. 
It is definite. She agreed to lead them to you 
using her cell phone as a tracker. 
Look, my source managed to stall their surveillance team for a while... 
but you need to get to the airfield immediately. 
I'll call my driver, have him take care of her. 
 No. I'll do it. 
 Colonel, I told you. They are tracking her. 
If you let her come to you, you're risking your chances of escape. 
I said I'll take care of her. 
Without you, Sangala has no leader. 
These people- they work for Dubaku, don't they? 
Mr. Matobo. We've accessed 
the air intake to your safe room. 
We're now feeding in ammonium distearate gas. 
 If you do not open the door, you will die. 
 Ule. 
Alama, no! 
Get him out of there! 
Get the woman too. 
 Mr. Taylor. 
 Sam. 
I can't stay long. They killed Roger 
and made it look like a suicide. 
  Who are they? 
 I don't know who they are. 
They just said they would kill me if I said anything. 
Roger was tasked with auditing the brokers in his department. 
It's all here- account numbers, trading records, everything that he knew. 
Roger was looking into things he shouldn't have. 
You killed my son. 
Tetradiazene, sir. 
It's a neuromuscular paralytic. 
Situation here is in control. 
Are you tracking Ms. Roth? 
 Yeah. 
 Time to get her back to her apartment. 
 Ms. Roth. Henry Taylor sent me. 
 Yes? 
Mr. Taylor's been looking into 
the matter you discussed. 
 My God. 
 He believes you're in imminent danger. 
He wants me to place you in protective custody. 
Larry, it's Renee. I've got a visual on them 
loading Matobo and his wife into a truck. 
 Where the hell is SWAT? 
 They're still about five minutes out. 
Drop the gun. 
Far as I can tell, she's alone. 
Damn you, Bauer, you son of a bitch. 
Nichols wants her out of the way before we deliver Matobo. 
 Kill her. 
 Yeah. 
Turn around. 
If you trust me, I will get you through this alive. 
 The following takes place between 1:00 p.m. And 2:00 p.m. 
I want three more teams combing the site where Matobo was abducted. 
Pull 'em in from Regional if you have to. 
We're gonna expand the search. 
Coordinate with Metro Police to set up a point-by-point grid encompassing a 10-mile radius. 
And talk with N.S.A. I wanna back all of 
 I'll do what I can. 
 What does that mean? 
Well, every time I ask for something, they pull that cloak and dagger nonsense. 
I have to get approval for every little scrap of data. 
Janis, this isn't easy for anybody. 
 Just please, make it happen. 
 Yes, sir. 
We know that another attack could be imminent. 
The only way to stop it is to find Almeida and Bauer and take control of the C.I.P. Device. 
Um, for those of you who haven't heard... 
Renee Walker was abducted by these people. 
We're the only chance she's got. 
Well, let's get to work. 
 What've you got? 
 Audio forensics cleaned up the recording. 
 Walker is extraneous. 
Kill her before you get here. 
  Okay. We'll be with you soon. 
 Be quick about it. 
Dubaku's anxious to get his hands on the prime minister. 
We've been combing through it, looking for a tag that'll give up their location. 
 So far, nothing. 
 Is there anybody else you can put on this? 
Larry, I don't think it's worth it. 
There's nothing here. 
 All right. Fine. HelpJanis coordinate with N.S.A. 
 I'm sorry about Renee, Larry. 
 She was a good agent. 
 We don't know that she's dead yet! 
 All right? 
 All right. 
Just Are you sure this is it? 
She's gonna run out of air. 
Tony said near the backhoe. 
Here. 
I got her, Chloe. I got her. 
All right. Here she is. Here she is. 
She's not breathing. 
Give me the adrenaline. 
   It's all right. 
You're okay. You're okay. 
 Who are you? 
 We're working with Jack. 
He told us where to find you. 
It's gonna be okay. 
Take deep breaths. 
You're gonna be okay. 
 We're close to the rendezvous point. What's your E.T.A. 
Good. 
I'll see you then. 
It's all set. 
Nichols is on his way with the diamonds. 
Something bothering you, Jack? 
You know, I was wondering why you never told Tony how you got him out of C.T.U. 
How did you do it? 
Christopher Henderson. 
Christopher Henderson tried to kill him. 
Henderson had no intention of killing Tony. 
He purposely missed the artery when he injected him. 
It was just enough to slow his heart to the point where you'd think that he was dead. 
My job was to extract and revive him... 
and use him against you. 
And? 
By the time I stabilized him, you'd already killed Henderson. 
The mission had failed, so my team went dark. 
Why didn't you just let Tony go? 
Tony chose to stay with us. 
He was consumed with hatred and anger over what the government had done to Michelle. 
Anyway, I talked to him. 
More importantly, I listened to him. 
Pretty soon, he came to realize that I was right. 
About what? 
That the rules had changed. 
That there was nothing such as honor left. 
That we would have to take care of each other. 
 Like brothers. 
  Mr. Emerson. 
 Yeah? 
 We're almost there. 
How's the deal gonna go down? 
Don't worry, Jack. 
You're about to find out. 
Are you ready? 
 Yeah. 
 Are you sure? 
Yeah. 
Go help Litvak with the door. 
 Go get the Matobos. 
 Yeah. 
 You better tell me what the hell's goin' on. 
 Drop the gun, David. 
I just couldn't figure out your play... 
so I tried to give you some time so you'd come clean. 
 'Cause we are like brothers, right, Tony? 
 Put the gun down, David. 
You actually think that I would let you steal those diamonds from me? 
It's not about the diamonds. 
It's about killing innocent people. 
I can't let you finish this. 
Take the shot. 
 Put down the weapon, or I will kill him. 
 Tony, take the shot! 
 Shut up, Jack! 
  Put it down, or he's dead! 
 David, I don't want to kill you, but I will! 
 Damn it, Tony! Drop the 
   You okay? 
Yeah. David? 
Okay, you say Bauer and Almeida are working undercover, but C.T.U. Has been shut down. 
So, I mean, if you're telling the truth, who's running this operation? 
We are. 
We're not working with any agency. 
We believe there's been widespread infiltration of the government... 
by Dubaku and theJuma regime. 
Okay. I need to contact my boss. 
 He needs to know that I'm okay. 
 You can't do that. 
 Why not? 
 Dubaku has informants in the F.B.I. 
If they found out you're alive, they'll know Jack is working against them. 
 You don't know who you can trust. 
 I can trust Agent Moss. 
You're not listening to me. 
You cannot contact the F.B.I. 
You will jeopardize this operation, and I won't let you do that. 
Well, I don't work for you. 
I work for Larry. Now, give me a phone. 
 Sit still, please. 
 We're nearing the endgame. 
Dubaku is the key to finding out who in the government has been corrupted. 
Luckily, we have something he wants. 
Matobo? 
He's our best chance to locate Dubaku, reacquire the C.I.P. Module... 
and get to the bottom of the government corruption. 
Until all that happens, you have to stay dead. 
 Yeah? 
  Did you find Agent Walker? 
Yeah, we got her, Jack. 
She's fine. Where are you? 
Northwoods Airfield. Litvak is dead. 
Emerson's been wounded. 
 Nichols is en route. 
I need you to get over here now. 
 Have you talked to Matobo? 
 Not yet. 
 He needs to agree to this. 
We can't do it without him. 
I'll get him to agree. 
Just get over here. 
It's all right. 
What the hell is going on? 
Mr. Matobo, I'm not gonna 
hurt you or your wife. 
I know how scared you are, and I know what you've been through, but we are here to help you. 
What in God's name are you talking about? 
You kidnapped us! 
We had to, to gain Dubaku's trust. 
That's the man we're after. 
We're trying to stop him. 
 I want to call my people. 
 I can't let you do that. 
Not until you hear me out. 
Sir, we have a plan to stop Dubaku, but we can't do it without your help. 
We don't have much time. 
Please, come with me. 
Mr. Dubaku. 
I'm heading to the meeting place. 
They're bringing Matobo now. 
 And his wife? 
 Both of them. 
Once you have Matobo, you know what to do. 
Emerson's team is now a loose end. 
Tie it off. 
Are you sure about this? 
We may need their services again. 
I would rather keep my diamonds. 
And Almeida has proved to be a liability. 
So... any response from the White House? 
Not the one we wanted. 
American forces are still in position. 
President Taylor must know we have Matobo. 
She can't attack Sangala without him. 
The country would collapse. 
Taylor may be holding out hope that she can somehow retrieve Matobo. 
Or she doesn't believe we are willing to carry out our threats. 
She will only respond when there are dead Americans. 
I'll call you when I have Matobo. 
These gentlemen are at your command. 
There are still 1,300 planes in the air. 
Which region do you want targeted? 
Washington, D.C. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. I understand, Bob. 
All right. Thanks. 
That was Bob Cornell at N.S.A. 
 They've detected another firewall breach. 
 There's been another attack? 
Not yet, but they believe the C.I.P. Device is being utilized. 
We have to assume Dubaku is initiating another attack. 
It's safe to say this won't be another warning shot. 
This time, Dubaku's gonna make sure that people die. 
I want to speak personally with all first responders across the country. 
They need to know to brace for the worst and that they have our full support. 
Instead of preparing for it... 
maybe we should be trying to preempt this attack, Madam President. 
The deadline Dubaku gave us for withdrawing our troops from Sangala has passed. 
But if we made some kind of gesture... 
began an immediate pullback, it might keep Dubaku from pulling the trigger. 
We've discussed this, Ethan. 
It's not an option. 
I won't be dictated to by this madman. 
Madam President, we can't invade Sangala without Matobo. 
And there's very little chance ofhim being recovered. 
Why are we risking American lives? 
I've told you my reasons. 
I implore you, withdraw our forces before it's too late. 
You asked me to be your adviser because you trust my opinion. I'm givin' it to you now. 
 We're out of options. 
 We're not, Ethan. 
The N.S.A. Is attempting to localize... 
what part of the infrastructure is being targeted... 
and the F.B.I. Is still trying 
to track down the C.I.P. Device. 
I'll keep an open channel with both agencies. 
 I'll keep you apprised. 
 Good. 
Let me see it. Let me see it! 
This wasn't about the diamonds, David. 
You crossed a line I wasn't willing to cross. 
I'm sorry. 
You're looking for forgiveness. 
Go to hell. 
You live with it. 
You are asking us to risk our lives... 
to be delivered into Dubaku's hands, based on nothing but what you have told us. 
Everything I have told you is the truth. 
Dubaku is in this country, and we need to find him. 
You have as much at stake as we do. 
He's attacked both our countries. 
Listen to him, Ule. 
You told me yourself President Taylor will not commit forces to Sangala... 
until these attacks are stopped. 
 But how can we trust this man? 
 Because he has no reason to lie. 
I will do what you ask, but I will go alone. 
Dubaku wants you and your wife. 
That's the deal. 
No. I will not put my wife 
in the hands of that monster. 
I will be honest with you, sir. 
He wants your wife as leverage. 
If I don't deliver both of you, he will back out. 
Leverage? 
You mean he want to torture her to make me tell him what I know about the resistance in Sangala? 
Yes, sir. And we won't let that happen. 
We'll be following you. 
Still, you can't promise me that she won't be harmed, can you? 
Can you? 
I won't do it. 
 May I speak with my husband? 
 Of course, ma'am. 
 I want to do this, Ule. 
 What? 
I am ashamed that I opened the door to the safe room. 
I want to do what is right for our country. 
 Absolutely not. 
 You can't stop me, Ule. 
Sangala is my country too. 
I have been by your side for 22 years. 
I am not going to leave it now. 
Mr. Bauer. 
We will do this together. 
Thank you. 
You are both very brave. 
We'll need to go soon. 
Excuse me for one moment. 
Tony. 
The Matobos are gonna work with us. 
We've gotta go. 
Tony. 
Let's get the bodies out of sight. 
Yeah. 
We're locked onto the F.A.A. Node. 
Begin rerouting the targets. 
R.S.A. 471, 
turn right, heading 2-7-4. 
Descend and maintain flight level 2-7-0. 
Call the White House. 
The latest report from the N.S.A. 
 I can summarize it for you. 
 Go ahead. 
They've had no luck in localizing the firewall breach. 
Dubaku's attack could hit anywhere. 
 And what about the F.B.I. 
  They've dedicated every available agent to the manhunt for Matobo. 
 They're no closer to finding him. 
 Excuse me. 
We're at a dead end, Madam President. 
You need to order the pullback, and you need to order it now. 
Can it be traced? Yeah. 
Hold on. Madam President? 
What is it, Tim? 
I've just been forwarded a scrambled call. 
It's from Colonel Dubaku. 
He's demanding to speak with you. 
I'll take it. 
This is President Taylor. 
Madam President... 
I'm disappointed that you have not taken my demands seriously. 
Your forces are still in position near my country. 
Colonel Dubaku, I assure you... 
we've had very serious discussions regarding your demands. 
The time for discussions is over. 
The deadline for your forces to begin their withdrawal has passed. 
Go to the window. 
Look to the southwest, Madam President. 
 What? 
 See what you have done. 
 Colonel Dubaku, if you're endangering one American life    Oh, my God. 
 Go, Madam President. 
You son of a bitch. 
Comply with my demands within the hour... 
or 10,000 more Americans will die. 
Is the cabinet still assembled? 
Yes, Madam President. 
It was Flight 131 out of Chicago. 
240 passengers, 10 crew members. 
It collided with a small commuterjet carrying 21 people. 
There's also a high probability of casualties on the ground. 
The aircraft went down in a residential neighborhood near Edgeborough. 
Thank you. 
We've also just gotten word that Congressman Brighten and his wife... 
may have been on 131. 
 We're waiting for confirmation. 
 How many planes are still in the air? 
Over 1,300. 
Madam President, this is a catastrophic loss of American lives. 
It's only gonna get worse. We have to 
withdraw our forces before the next deadline. 
I'm forced to agree, Madam President. 
Go ahead, Tim. 
I want to hear what you think. 
We're simply not prepared to contend with the scope of damage... 
these people can inflict. 
The tragedy we just witnessed is nothing compared to what could happen... 
if they begin targeting more sensitive installations power grids, nuclear facilities. 
We're talking deaths in the hundreds of thousands. 
All in support of a policy that cannot possibly succeed without Matobo. 
He is the only man who can stabilize Sangala. 
Without him, the entire operation is pointless. 
There's still a chance that Prime Minister Matobo will be recovered. 
And while that chance exists, I'm not giving in. 
Admiral Smith, your strike force will remain in position and at full battle readiness. 
 Yes, Madam President. 
 You are guaranteeing another attack on our country. 
We will not be blackmailed, Joe, and we will not be held hostage. 
This country does not negotiate with terrorists. 
Tell that to the families of the dead. 
Do you have any idea what the public reaction will be when word gets out... 
that these are acts of terrorism brought about by your reckless foreign policy? 
I can guarantee there will be a call for your impeachment. 
 That's enough, Joe. 
 I will not stand by and let this happen. 
Then turn in your resignation, Joe, because I'm not changing my mind. 
Now sit down or leave. 
I'm- I'm sorry, Madam President. 
You people think about what you're doing here... 
about the price you're willing to pay. 
Gentlemen, ladies. 
I know that there are many of you here who agree with Secretary Stevens. 
If I can't alleviate your doubts... 
I can at least help you to understand my reasonings. 
When I took the oath of office... 
I swore to myself and to the American people... 
that this country would continue to be a force for good in this world. 
We're a nation founded on ideals... 
and those ideals are being challenged today. 
Now, how we respond... 
will not only define this administration, but an entire generation. 
And not just Americans... 
but Sangalans and anyone else... 
who looks to us for guidance and strength. 
I won't fail them... 
and neither will you. 
We're in for some tough times ahead. 
Let's make sure we're ready. 
Thank you, everyone. 
Rescue teams continue at this time. 
 Hey, Jack. 
 They're over there. 
I want you to put a wire on Mr. Matobo 
as fast as you can. Go. 
You okay? 
What do you think, Jack? 
You shot me and buried me alive. 
If we hadn't, Emerson would've killed you. 
I'm sorry we had to keep you in the dark, but we didn't have a choice. 
Yes, you did. 
You could've trusted me. 
If I had told you everything back at the F.B.I., 
would you have believed me? 
Have a seat please, sir. 
What's that? 
It's a transmitter. 
I'll be affixing it to one of your teeth. 
We'll know exactly where you are at all times. You won't be alone. 
 Are you with the F.B.I. 
 No. I'm a stayathome mom. 
Open your mouth, please. 
Wider. Good. 
Chloe accessed the F.B.I. Server. 
Dubaku brought down two planes just outside the capitol. 
Over 270 people were killed. 
He's threatened to kill 10,000 more. 
We have less than an hour to stop him. 
 How long before Nichols gets here? 
 Ten minutes. 
 Here's your comm. 
 Thanks. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. Just a little dizzy. 
 You should take a seat. 
 I'm fine. 
Hey, come on. Take a seat. 
Is all of this really true? 
Yeah. 
I've devoted my life to the Bureau... 
and you expect me to believe it's corrupted, the entire government's been corrupted? 
Not all of'em. But until we find out who, 
we can't trust anyone. 
 The four of you really think you can stop this? 
 We have to. 
It's as simple as that. 
Ethan. 
Can we? 
The president is completely alone on this, and she's gonna get a lot of Americans killed. 
We've gotta find a way to talk some sense into her. 
We're both on the same side, Tim. I'm gonna 
need your help if we're gonna change her mind. 
How do you propose we do that? 
There is someone she'll listen to. 
Maybe we can convince him to help us. 
 Go ahead. 
 I just dropped her off. She's on her way up. 
Okay. Stay in the car and keep watch. 
I'll call you when it's done. 
Oh! Mr. Taylor, 
how did you get in here? 
Um, the agent you sent just brought me by to get a few of my things before we Mr. Taylor, are you all right? 
Mr. Taylor, are you okay? 
Mr. Taylor, unless you tell me 
what's wrong, I don't know what Help me. Help me, please. 
 Yes, Mr. Kanin? 
 Agent Gedge, I'm looking for Henry Taylor. 
He's not answering his phone. 
Is he with you? 
 You can't talk with him right now, sir. 
 Why not? Where is he? 
Well, he's meeting with Samantha Roth in her apartment, sir. 
 For what possible reason? 
 Well, I don't know, sir. He didn't tell me. 
Why aren't you with him? 
Mr. Taylor insisted on meeting 
with her alone, sir. I'm in the car. 
I'm just outside the building. 
I don't give a damn what he insisted. 
We went through this, Agent Gedge. 
You were supposed to keep him away from her. 
 What the hell were you thinking? 
 I'm sorry, sir. 
I'm not interested in your apology. 
Just pull him out of there and have him phone me as soon as possible. 
Don't try to speak, sir. 
There's nothing left to say. 
 Additional rescue teams have been brought in to join the emergency teams  We are ready. 
 All right. 
 They're coming. One car, from the service road. 
 How many people? 
 I can't tell. The windows are tinted. 
 Copy that. 
 How you doin', Tony? 
 All right. 
I was glad to hear you're still with us. 
Where's Emerson? 
 You're not gonna be dealing with him today. 
 What do you mean? 
He's dead. So's Litvak and Bauer. 
I got 'em in a back room. 
You wanna say hi? 
You better start telling me what the hell is going on. 
I decided I'd rather not split the cut. 
Well, I don't understand. 
I thought you and Emerson were friends. 
Yeah, that's before he left me to rot with the F.B.I. 
You want Matobo or not? 
 Where is he? 
 Close. 
I want to see him and his wife. 
Diamonds. 
Matobo. 
He's in the back of the truck. 
Keep your tracks clean. 
We might call on you again. 
All right? 
Okay then. 
Let's put that behind us. 
You got what you want. 
Now get the hell out of here. 
Now! 
 Clear. 
 Chloe? 
 Jack, I've got him. 
 Get everyone ready to move out. 
Gedge. 
Gedge. 
Don't do this. 
Please. 
 There has been no comment from the White House... 
but the incident's proximity to the Executive Mansion... 
has lead to widespread speculation that terrorists were indeed responsible... 
for the midair collision that caused the deaths of 270 passengers and crew... 
and an unknown number The White House still has not complied. 
American forces are still in position. 
I think this president is not just stubborn. She's insane. 
  What do you intend to do? 
 Exactly what we promised. 
 We're ready, sir. 
 I'll see you in a moment. 
 Where is the target located? 
 Kidron, Ohio. 
 Population? 
 30,000. 
The processing facility is located two miles west of the town center. 
Casualties will be high about 18,000. 
Begin. 
Colonel Dubaku. 
We are just leaving the township now, sir. 
 How many do you have? 
 Five. 
Only five? 
By the time we got to the field, most of the boys were gone. 
I need soldiers, not excuses. 
I will bring some more, sir, I promise. 
Just bring them to me. 
Youssou, take this. 
You will learn to fight like men. 
Of that I have no doubt. 
This... will make you 
strong little soldiers. 
This will make you free. 
Come. 
Take it. 
Ah. 
How does it make you feel? 
Powerful, yes? 
Come. 
Your mothers and your fathers, they have made you weak. 
But General Juma, he will make you strong! 
He will make you strong so that you can take back the country... 
from the governments and the traitors that work for them! 
 Like this cockroach, here! 
  Down. 
This cockroach works for the government and their white masters. 
 Yes. Yes. 
  No, no. 
Have mercy on me. 
They have taken our land. 
No. 
But soon all that will change. 
Soon all the land will belong to the people again. 
So... 
we must buy our freedom... 
with the blood of this cockroach. 
No. 
He's only a cockroach, and you know what we do to cockroaches. 
Chop up the cockroach. 
Kill the cockroach. 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
Kill the cockroach! 
The following takes place between 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. 
Events occur in real time. 
 I thought I told you to turn up the air-conditioner. 
 All right, sir. I do so. 
 For crying out loud. 
     Go on! Go around them! Go on. 
But we need another player. 
Find somebody else. 
Who? Tell me, Willie 
Who can handle the ball better than you? 
That's right. No one. 
We're not supposed to go to town without Mr. Benton. 
Mr. Benton worries too much, 
and so do you. 
Hey, Desmond! 
Hurry, or the bus will leave. Come on. 
Let's go. 
You're not my father. 
I'm your brother, and you'll do what I say. 
 No! 
 Fine then. 
The truck is here! 
The truck is here! 
Hey! The truck is here! 
The truck is here! 
I wasn't stealing it. 
I swear. 
I was just looking. 
Forgot these. 
Very pretty. 
For a woman, yes? 
I was gonna give it to my daughter one day. 
You have a daughter? 
Yeah. 
Where did you get it? 
Rajasthan. 
India. You ask 
a lot of questions. 
That's what Mr. Benton says. 
I bet. 
When were you there? 
 Last summer. 
 Before you came here? 
Yes. 
And before that, where were you? 
 Different places. 
 When are you going home? 
I'm not going home. 
Listen, I told the other boys I'd help them unload the truck. 
 If you want that, you can keep it. 
 Really? 
Really. 
Willie. 
You're gonna have to give me my knife back though. 
Go on. 
Hey, Willie. 
The supply truck's here. 
 The boys could use some help. 
 Look what Jack gave me. 
Very nice. 
It's from India. 
Jack, this is Frank Tramell. 
He's the ambassador's chief political officer. 
I know who he is. 
He says he left some messages for you to come see him at the embassy. 
I got his messages. 
What's going on, Jack? 
I'll tell you what's going on. 
The senate subcommittee has questions... 
about the illegal detention and torture of certain prisoners in Mr. Bauer's custody. 
I have a subpoena requesting you to appear, and it's way past due. 
So consider yourself served. 
I told the boys I'd help them unload the truck. 
Excuse me. 
Failure to comply to a subpoena is a federal offense, Mr. Bauer. 
You are bound by law to respond. 
Then give them my response. 
They want me back in Washington, they can come and get me. 
The, uh, ambassador said... 
that you and Bauer were in the special forces together? 
 How long has he been here? 
 A few months. 
He never mentioned the subpoena? 
Nope. 
Well, he's been ducking it for more than a year, across three different continents. 
Washington is leaning on the ambassador to deliver him. 
And now the ambassador's leaning on you. 
Bauer doesn't come back to the States on his own, they'll come for him. 
That would be a mistake. 
You're doing God's work here, Carl. 
Between malaria and the wars, these kids never had a chance. 
Now you're giving them a decent life. 
It'd be a shame if the funding dried up. 
Don't threaten me, Frank. 
I'm just giving you the facts. 
You're his friend. 
Talk some damn sense into him. 
Here, Jack. 
Thank you, Thomas. 
Okay. Go back. 
Now you. Go, go. 
There he is. 
The mighty warrior who traded his gun for a wheelbarrow. 
Why are you here, hmm? 
To do penance for all your sins? 
You don't want to talk about it. 
I don't blame you. 
 Watch out. 
 The man from the embassy What did he want? 
Nothing. He just 
wanted to talk. 
Talk about what? 
Willie, you ask too many damn questions. 
Let's go. Here's the oranges. 
Willie? Come here. 
I need your help. 
Thank you. Come with me. 
Jimmy. Take a box. 
Here. Careful. 
Don't drop it. 
The government won't be able to hold out against us for long. 
Except we have more weapons than soldiers who can use them. 
We need to overrun the main garrison from the west. 
We have minefields here and here. 
Then I'll bring you more little soldiers to clear them. 
Do not worry. 
Our father would be really proud, Youssou. 
Very proud. 
You will have your little soldiers. 
Go. 
This is Colonel Dubaku. 
Hodges here. 
I've just heard some troubling news, Colonel, that your recruiting numbers are-- are still coming up a little short. 
I want you to know my offer stands. 
I've got personnel standing by right across the border. 
They can be deployed within the hour. 
That won't be necessary. 
Oh? 
Do some thinking now, Colonel. 
I'm offering you professional soldiers, not children you haven't had time to train. 
You provided the weapons. 
We will fight our own war. 
Well, it's your country. 
It will be, soon. 
Is there anything else, Mr. Hodges? 
Yeah. 
Uh, tell General Juma... 
give me a call when he gets there, will you? 
I'll let him know. 
Good. 
That's one hard-nosed son of a bitch. 
It is his country. 
But I'm paying for it. 
I don't want those transactions traceable, Mr. Nichols. 
Not by the S.E.C., 
the I.R.S. or any 
of my ex-wives. 
You understand me, don't you? 
John, what do you want me to tell you? 
You gotta hang in there and be patient, my friend. 
I'm trying. 
Yeah, yeah. I know. 
Hold on, hold on. 
Stop. Stop. 
We got caught by the margin. 
It's gonna turn around. 
Yes. Yes, it is. 
Yes, it is. 
Yeah, you've gotta give it time... 
and just, yeah, be patient. 
Yeah. Okay. 
Yes. Yes. Okay. 
All right. Bye-bye. 
All right. Next up. Right? 
Chris. 
Yeah. 
Would you come in here, please? 
Who's that guy? 
A client. 
I need you to close out Abu Dhabi and Eritrea. 
Burn the records and bury the ashes. 
Go. 
Yeah. 
Jack. 
Can I have a word? 
Yeah. Willie, 
go on out to the truck. 
Pick up another load. 
It's all right. 
Go, go. 
I think you should take a look at this. 
I don't need to. 
I know what it says. 
Don't worry, Carl. 
I'll be gone by dark. 
I'm not asking you to leave, Jack. I'm asking you 
to have a conversation. 
Tramell says this subpoena's been chasing you for over a year now. 
It's gonna catch up with you sometime. 
I'm not going back. 
I'm not saying you should. 
But a year's a long time to spend looking over your shoulder. 
A lifetime of that's gonna drive you out of your mind. 
Whatever I've done I've paid for in full. 
All I've got left is my freedom. I'm not lettin' 
them take that away from me. 
Freedom. What kind 
of freedom's this, Jack? 
You're runnin' away. 
What do you want from me, Carl? 
What do you want? 
I want you to trust me, Jack. 
I am your friend. 
I'm sorry. 
Look. 
I can't remember the many times you saved my life. 
But I do know that I owe you. 
You've lost a lot, Jack. 
I know that. 
I know that. 
When you called me up for the first time in What? Ten years? 
I hoped you were maybe looking for more than just a place to stay. 
I'm trying to find a way to make some sense of it all. 
It's a normal impulse, especially for people like us. 
Yeah, except you found what you were looking for. 
Yeah. 
Damn it. 
Carl. 
Carl! 
I just meant it's different for me. 
You never asked me why I quit. 
I figured you would have told me if you wanted me to know. 
While I was in Beirut a counterinsurgency operation. 
I was holding a suspect. 
The attack window was open. 
Our time was limited. 
I was sure I had the right guy, but he wasn't giving me the information I needed, so I kept pushing. 
Pushed him hard... 
until he finally told me what I wanted to hear... 
right before he died. 
He wasn't the right guy, Jack. 
The intel was bad. 
 I lost 14 men and 21 civilians that day. 
 Carl, that's the job. 
People like you and me, Jack We don't We don't keep score by counting how many lives we've saved, but by how many we've lost. 
You know, I'm not so sure I have found what I was lookin' for. 
But I have found a way to live with myself. 
It took a long time. 
The first thing I had to do was stop running. 
I meant what I said, Jack. 
You can stay here. 
We'll fight this thing together. 
Sorry. 
Don't worry about Tramell. 
The state department's not the only place with money. 
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Carl, but this is my problem. 
I'm not gonna let it become yours. 
Remember what the lieutenant used to say about trouble? 
"Comes cheap, leaves expensive." 
Yeah. Yeah. 
What you've done with this place. 
The school, what you've done for the boys It's worth protecting. 
You and I both know it'd be better for everyone if I leave. 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
Me too. 
Me too. 
Thank you, Carl. 
I mean that. 
Thank you for everything. 
Always. 
Yeah. 
 Where is he going? 
 I'm not sure. 
But he's leaving. 
Yeah. 
He is. 
You are just a boy. 
You do not know what you are talking about. 
What do you know? 
This isn't even your country, yeah? 
 Hey, hey, hey! 
What's goin' on? 
 Thomas is talking nonsense. 
He's spreading rumors about Juma. 
Rumors? They are not rumors. 
Juma's soldiers have been crossing the border and stealing our children. 
Juma has no soldiers, and he has no weapons. 
Everyone knows that. 
My cousin is missing. 
He went to the market yesterday, and he has not returned. 
Then it was gunrunners that took him, or someone from the diamond mines. 
My brother is in town with James. 
You see that, hmm? 
Now you have the boy worried. 
He should be worried. 
We should all be worried. 
Stop it, both of you. 
Finish up work. 
I'll go into town and see if we can find out what's going on. 
 Fine, but you are wasting your time. 
  Take this. 
I thought I told you kids not to go into town without telling me. 
Desmond never listens to anyone but Desmond. 
Where'd he go? 
Playing football. 
There's a field just past the bridge. 
I'll be back soon. 
Benton. 
You're not seriously worried about all of this, are you? 
If Juma was making trouble, we would have heard something, no? 
Probably, but this is Sangala. 
I'm not taking any chances. 
Yo. Hey. 
Pass it! Pass it! 
Left, left, left! 
Pass the ball, James. 
The ball! 
What'd you think that was, huh? 
Nothing. 
What you say, "nothing"? 
Now you wanna fight. 
Oh, wow! 
He's so powerful, guys. 
Give him a hand. 
Oh, you just threw the ball away. 
Now you wanna fight. 
Now you wanna fight. 
Yes. 
Go fetch the ball if you want the ball. 
Go fetch it. 
 Run! 
  Oh, no! 
Yeah. Yeah. 
One at a time. 
One at a time. 
One at a time! 
You are now soldiers in the People's Freedom Army. 
You will all have the honor of fighting the imperialists... 
until we have taken back our land. 
Samuel tells me you are from the American school in Okavango. 
These Americans make our people slaves. 
But we will free you, and we will free the other children... 
so they can become soldiers. 
Take them. 
Let's go. 
Come on. Go, go! 
Tell me your name. 
Seville. 
Louder. 
Seville. 
Are you a baby, Seville? 
I asked you a question. 
Are you a baby? 
No. 
Good, because we need soldiers, Seville. 
Not babies who wet themselves. 
Now stop crying, or I'll stop you myself. 
Commander! 
Put them in the truck! 
Let's go! 
Go. Go! 
Faster! Don't lose them! 
   What are you doing? 
Idiot! They are 
no good to us dead! 
Go! 
This is an historic day marking the swearing in... 
of America's first female president. 
Behind me, the sidewalks along Pennsylvania Avenue are crowded with spectators... 
here to catch a glimpse of the passing motorcade. 
With the inauguration less than two hours away, President Daniels is scheduled to meet with his successor here at the White House... 
to review final details for the transfer of power. 
Their respective transition teams have been working together for several weeks... 
to ensure a smooth turnover. 
Stop looking at me like that. 
Watching you get dressed is almost as fun as watching you get undressed. 
Uh-huh. 
Shouldn't you be getting dressed? 
We got time. 
Mmm. 
Hey, you need to shave. 
You're gonna be on TV. 
Mmm, mmm. 
Stop it. 
Hello. 
Uh, I need to talk to you, Rog. 
Chris? 
Yeah. Look. 
Uh, I think I might be in trouble. 
Okay. 
You using again? 
That's not what this is about. 
You didn't answer my question. 
I can't, uh I can't really talk on the phone, okay? 
I was hoping that I could, um-- I could meet up with you face to face. 
 Now? 
 Rog, hang on a second. 
Chris? 
I know. I know, I know. 
It's terrible timing. 
Believe me, I know. 
But I wouldn't be asking if it wasn't really important. 
 I gotta leave in 45 minutes, man. 
 I can be there in 20. 
Chris I am not gonna stay long. 
I swear, Rog. Just please. 
Do this for me? 
 Fine, but I'm outta here in 45 minutes. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
You're letting Chris come here right now? 
He's having some kind of relapse or something. 
What am I supposed to do? 
Exactly! What are you 
supposed to do? 
 Make sure he calls his sponsor? I don't know. 
 This is so Chris. 
He's been a friend for a really long time. 
He got me my job, which, if he hadn't, I wouldn't have met you. 
Don't. Stop. 
Hmm? Hmm? 
Just don't be late for your mother's inauguration. 
Okay? 
I always liked his advice too. 
Madam President? 
Not yet. 
This way. 
Nice to see you. 
Hello. 
How are you feeling? 
Excited. 
Nervous. 
You should be. 
In a few hours, you're going to be the most powerful person in the world. 
As if you're not already hard enough to live with. 
Ma'am. Mr. Taylor. 
Tom. 
The president apologizes he could not be here to greet you in person. 
But something urgent has come up. 
Something urgent? 
Whatever it is, Tom, it's gonna land on my desk in about two hours. 
Could I just have a moment? 
I'm sorry. 
Don't be. Go ahead. 
Our embassy in Sangala just got word of an imminent coup. 
How imminent? 
Very. 
Where's the president now? 
He's in the TelePresence suite. 
He's on a secure line with Prime Minister Matobo. 
Mr. President, 
my country's in crisis, and here is the proof. 
This video was taken moments ago. 
Juma's moving his forces toward the capital as we speak. 
Mr. Prime Minister, 
this news has caught us all by surprise. 
But our priority here in Washington is to ensure the safety of you and your family. 
My priority is to defend my country from this monster Juma, and the only way that can happen is if you accelerate... 
the military assistance your congress has already pledged to us. 
Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to make that happen. 
Certainly not today. 
What about your successor? 
Will she be in a better position to help us? 
I'm afraid I can't speak for her. 
 Will you excuse us for a moment? 
 Yes, of course. 
You were right, sir. 
Taylor does want to weigh in on this. 
Where is she? 
Just outside. 
   I am sorry, Mr. Prime Minister, 
but I have to cut this short. 
The president-elect is waiting for me. 
Please, sir, convey to her my request for military assistance. 
I'll do that. 
Thank you, sir. 
Well, my first day. 
Mr. President. 
Senator Taylor. 
Tom told me what's happening in Sangala. 
It is a damn tough situation. 
I don't understand. 
How could Juma raise an army without our getting wind of it? 
We disarmed him three years ago. 
The U.N.'s been 
monitoring the situation. 
Not closely enough apparently. 
Then you have no idea who's supplying him? 
All we know is Juma's secured some fairly advanced weapons systems, which is why Prime Minister Matobo... 
is asking for our military assistance. 
And what did you tell him? 
The truth. 
It's not a viable option. 
You don't agree. 
We have troops in the region. 
A show of force might make Juma blink. 
And if it doesn't, we get caught up in another civil quagmire... 
halfway around the world. 
Now, that is a hard sell. 
Especially when there's nothing in Sangala worth protecting. 
No natural resources, no substantial economic ties, nothing that threatens our national security. 
The last time Juma made a power grab, he ignited a tribal war that killed tens of thousands of civilians. 
Our involvement could avert a genocide. 
And this war will be tragic too. 
But it isn't our war. 
Which is why I've ordered the ambassador to begin evacuating all nonmilitary nationals. 
I think that's a mistake. 
I don't want any Americans caught in the cross fire when Juma starts shooting. 
Closing our embassy sends a signal to the world... 
that we are willing to sell out a democratic ally... 
to a war criminal. 
I appreciate your idealism. 
I can't say the same for your cynicism. 
Let's talk after you've been sitting in my chair for a while. 
And until then, we still have some transition business to go over, so I suggest we get started. 
Send in Tom Lennox. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
Mademoiselle. 
S'il vous pla�t. 
Merci, merci. 
No. 
Desmond! 
Desmond! 
Desmond. 
Desmond! 
Open your eyes. 
Open your eyes! 
That's it. 
Stay with me, Desmond. 
Stay with me. Open your eyes. 
Open your eyes. 
Do not go to sleep. 
Do you understand? 
Do not go to sleep. 
Good lad. 
Don't go to sleep. 
Then you're out. 
No. 
It's not heavy. 
I can carry it. 
I want to go with you. 
Me and my brother Desmond too. 
 We can carry your things and work for you. 
 No. 
Why not? 
Because you can't. 
I'm going alone. 
"People who like to be alone are witches," my grandfather says. 
Well, there you go. 
Your grandfather wouldn't be happy if you left here with a witch, now, would he? 
He would want me to go to America. 
His favorite was Elvis Presley. 
I'm not going to America. 
Where are you going then? 
I don't know yet. 
"I don't know yet" is better than here. 
You sure about that? 
Here doesn't seem so bad to me. 
Mr. Benton is very nice, 
but there are too many ghosts walking around. 
Ghosts? 
My mother, my father and my three sisters. 
They live in the bush and come out at night. 
But you wouldn't see them because you are Poo-mui. 
Poo-mui? 
A white person. 
Willie, you and I are friends, right? 
Then I want you to do me a favor, as a friend. 
I want you to stay here with Mr. Benton and help 
take care of the other boys. 
Can you do that? 
You promise? 
I promise. 
Okay. 
Thank you. 
It's not fair. 
How come he has to go, and we have to stay? 
It's not fair or unfair. 
It's just the way it is. Come. 
Help me finish. 
We're almost done. 
Jack! 
Benton from Direct Connect. 
He says he needs to talk to you. 
 Carl? 
 Jack. James is dead. 
Desmond's been shot. 
 What happened? 
 Juma's raising an army. 
Desmond says they're headed for the school. 
They're coming for the boys, Jack. You got to get them 
into the shelter. 
Thomas knows where it is. 
How many guns are coming? 
Maybe a dozen. I don't know. 
You'll have to hold them off till I get there. 
Carl, you need to call the embassy, get them to send some marines out here. 
I've been trying. 
I can't get through. 
Jack, go into my room. 
You'll find what you need in a locker under my sink. The 
key's on top of the cupboard. 
How far out are you? 
Maybe five minutes. 
Jack, don't let them take my kids. 
 Don't let them take the children. 
 Carl, I won't. 
Everybody! Everybody, 
I want you to listen! 
I want you to go to the shelter with Thomas. He's gonna 
take you there now! Go! 
What's going on? 
I don't have time to explain, Willie. 
Just go with Thomas and ring the bell. Now! 
What about my brother? 
Your brother's with Mr. Benton. 
Everybody, follow me! 
Juma's men are coming. 
Do you have a weapon? 
How do you know this isn't just another rumor? 
Do you have a weapon or not? 
If they are coming, I will talk to them. 
They will listen to me. 
Save your helmet for the parade. 
They are coming. Two of our boys 
have already been shot. 
The United Nations remains neutral in this matter. 
You son of a bitch. 
You still want to talk to them? 
I didn't think so. 
Why don't you go hide in the shelter with the other children? 
Willie! Enough. Let's go. 
Let's go, Willie. Come on. 
Come on! 
Hurry, hurry. 
Boys, go! 
Come on, Russell! 
You're the last? 
Yeah. 
Wait! Wait for me. 
Native Language ] Go! Find the boys! 
Find them! 
Fire! 
Come! 
In Native Language ] Keep going! This way! 
There, there! 
No. 
Do not kill him yet Not until he tells us where the children are hiding. 
Bring him. 
Stay here. Stay here. 
Where are you going? 
I'll be back in a bit. 
String him up. 
Tie him up. 
Yeah. 
I want him to suffer. 
U.S. citizens only. 
What about her? 
She's not American. 
She has family in the States. 
I have a sister in Chicago. 
She has a job. 
She needs to sponsor you. 
By then it will be too late. 
My husband died fighting Juma. 
Juma will kill me. 
He will kill my child. 
There's a U.N. camp 
across the eastern border. 
How will I get there? 
I have no transportation. 
The buses are all full. 
I cannot walk. 
I'm sorry. 
Whatever you want me to do for you, I will do. 
Please. 
Just take me from here. 
Anything at all. 
I can't. I'm sorry. 
Sir, it's Carl Benton. 
Please, don't let them kill my baby! 
Please! Please! 
 Benton. 
 I've been trying to get through to you. 
Yeah, our lines are overloaded. 
Juma's men are here. 
They're raising an army. 
We know. 
You know? 
Yeah, we don't know how he managed to pull it off. 
No one saw it coming. 
But he's got soldiers moving in on the capital. 
They're here right now, Frank. 
They're at my school. 
 You have to send some marines to help. 
 I can't spare any. 
They're all being deployed for the evacuation. 
 Evacuation? 
 The orders came down from the president. 
We're rolling up all U.S. 
nationals. We already started 
ferrying people to the border. 
Look, I got 14 kids hiding in a shelter, and one that's gonna bleed to death if he doesn't get medical attention. 
If you want us to get you out, get here on your own. The last 
chopper's leaving in an hour. 
Look, Frank. D-Don't 
strand me like this, please. 
My hands are tied, Carl. 
Frank-- Tramell, please. 
Sorry. 
Please don't Damn it! 
Damn it. 
I'm running out of ways to ask the question. 
Where are the children? 
Again. 
 We have searched all the buildings, sir. 
 Keep looking. 
You're wasting your time. 
They're not gonna find anything. 
I told you they're not here. 
Wait. 
You're lying. 
No, I'm not. 
If you wanna find soldiers for your army, you're gonna have to look somewhere else. 
Where... 
are the children? 
I told you I don't know. 
    Oh, Jack. 
I will keep doing this until you beg me to kill you. 
But I won't kill you even then. 
Not until you tell me... 
what I want to know. 
Please-- Please, no! No! 
I'll show you where the kids are. 
Tell me. 
I need to show you. They're 
in an underground shelter. 
No. 
You will tell me where this shelter is! 
Okay. 
About 200 meters up the footpath. 
Behind the tree line. 
There's a wooden hatch under a mound of dirt. 
Please, just-- Please. 
Get the children. 
I will stay here with him. 
Don't worry. 
Once I have these children, I will kill you quickly. 
    You all right, Jack? 
Yeah. The kids 
are in the shelter. 
How is Desmond? 
He's lost a lot of blood. 
The border's five hours from here. I don't think 
he's gonna make it. 
I'm gonna try and get 'em to the embassy. They've 
started evacuating already. 
How are you gonna get the kids asylum? 
They're not U.S. nationals. 
I've got sponsorship papers. 
Tramell's got to let them in. 
But I have to go now, Jack. 
The last chopper leaves in an hour. 
You all right? 
Go. Go! 
And, Jack, good luck. 
Stay here. 
Jack may need our help. 
And if they catch you, they will make you tell them where we are. 
You are endangering the rest of us. 
We wouldn't have been in danger... 
if you had done something about Juma instead of looking the other way. 
Right. Everyone out. 
Quickly. 
Go to the bus. 
Quickly. 
Thomas, go get Desmond. 
He's in the jeep by the end of the footpath. 
Quickly, quickly, quickly. 
Go to the bus. 
Go to the bus. Go to the bus. 
Where is my brother? 
Thomas has gone to get him. 
Then he's all right? 
He will be. He will be. 
Go to the bus. 
Quickly, quickly. 
Native Language ] Desmond. 
It's not as bad as it looks. 
Wait. Listen up! 
Listen up! 
Everyone, listen. 
We're taking the bus into the city. 
Once we're on the road I'll explain everything that's happening. All right? 
But we have to move now. 
On the bus. Move. 
Quickly. Quickly. 
Solenz! 
Where you going? 
I told Mr. Bauer before. 
The United Nations remains neutral in this conflict. 
A U.N. escort might help us 
get where we need to go. 
Solenz! 
Let him go! 
He's just trying to save his own ass because he knows the children are a target. 
You're gonna need my help, Carl. 
Juma's men are gonna set up roadblocks, checkpoints all the way into the city. 
I got one of the soldiers' walkies. We can use it 
to try and avoid them. 
Jack, you won't have to go anywhere near the embassy. 
Just help me get the kids to the city. You can head 
to the border from there. 
Let's go. 
Can you take it easy? 
Just keep your hands where I can see 'em. 
I told you, he's expecting me. 
Hey, Rog! 
R-Rog, can you call your watchdog off, please? 
Agent Vossler, he's a friend of mine. 
You can let him in. 
Your friend's jacked up on something. 
I'll take care of it. 
It's all right. 
I'll be outside. 
Thank you. 
Look, man, um, I know that my timing right now must, you know, suck. 
So thank you. It's just, 
I'm-- I think I'm in a little bit of trouble here. 
So What kind of trouble? 
Coke? Pills? 
Don't get all righteous on me, Rog. Okay? 
I seem to remember most nights you partying me under the table. 
 That was a long time ago. 
 Not that long ago. 
You got five minutes, so talk fast. 
Uh, okay. 
Couple months ago Nichols calls me into his office. 
Says he wants me to manage a special project. 
Special project? 
That's what he calls it. 
He says he knows I've taken some serious hits in the stock market, and he's gonna give me a chance to recover my losses. 
I mean, the money he paid me-- Rog. 
It was crazy. 
I mean, the money was really crazy. 
All I had to do was keep my mouth shut. 
What'd he have you do, Chris? 
Open a few offshore accounts, move money in and out, that type of thing. 
So you helped Nichols embezzle money from his own firm. 
Yeah, that's what I thought I was doing at first. 
But, Rog, three days ago I recognized the prefix on one of the accounts. 
It's something the Justice Department has red-flagged for traders to report. 
So, I do a little digging and, uh, turns out that the, uh the account holder... 
is on the terrorist watch list. 
Yeah. Yeah. 
Who is it? 
I don't know. 
I don't know, Rog. 
I don't wanna know. 
Frankly, it's all getting a little too weird for me. 
This morning there was this creepy guy in Nichols's office who Look, I don't know what he's doing. 
I don't want to have anything to do with it. 
I'm willing to turn state's evidence. 
Yeah? Good. 
You should go to the F.B.I. 
Man, I was just thinking that, uh I could probably cut a much better deal... 
if we take this directly to your mother. 
Y-You want my mother to clean up your mess? 
Chris, what do you expect me to say to that? 
I don't know, Rog. 
Uh, how about, "I'm sorry to hear that you're in trouble, Chris, but you're a friend of mine... 
and I'm gonna do whatever I can do to help you out"? 
Do you even have any evidence? 
 I'm working on it. 
 What does that mean? 
What does it mean? 
It means, um Nichols asked me to destroy some records. 
I didn't do it. 
I, um-- I sent them to my hard drive at home instead. 
They're coded, but, you know, they're probably traceable. 
 Hello, Chris. 
 Hey, Sam. 
 You look great. 
 Thank you. 
We really need to leave now. 
We're already pushing it. 
Agent Vossler's in the car waiting. 
I'll meet you there. 
I'm right behind you. 
Okay. 
 See you at work later? 
 Right. 
I have to go. 
I know. 
I know, I know, I know. 
If I forward you these records, will you at least show them to your mother? 
I'm not talking to anybody until I see them for myself. 
Okay, all right. That's 
Look, Rog, thank you. 
Just check your e-mail in one hour. 
Clean yourself up. 
Okay? 
Yeah. 
Sixteen mortar teams supported by 20 forward observers. 
Make sure we all have the same encryption codes. 
And have a backup in case government try to jam communication. 
Sir, General Juma is here. 
Welcome home, General. 
Colonel Dubaku. 
Look what you've built here. 
Our American friends have been very helpful. 
Did they send us the Howitzers? 
Yes. 
We have them in position about 20 kilometers from the capital. 
We can hit any target in the city. 
All we need is your order to begin the bombardment. 
Sir. 
One of our checkpoints. 
Excuse me, General. 
 Yes? 
 Colonel, this is Lieutenant Kintu. 
Checkpoint Delta. 
We have a man in custody, a U.N. relief worker. 
He was driving to his base, but we have detained him for questioning. 
He says he has information about your brother. 
 What sort of information? 
 He says your brother is dead, sir. 
No. 
Your brother and his men, they were ambushed at the American school. 
He says that he can help us find the man who killed your brother. 
Hold it steady. 
Good. 
Thank you, Willie. 
Desmond, you sure the bandage isn't too tight? 
Yeah. 
Be right back. 
Managed to stop the bleeding, but Desmond's fever is spiking. 
If we don't get him to a hospital soon, he's gonna go into shock. 
We're five kilometers from the city. 
Carl, I'm really sorry about the school. 
I know how much you put into it. 
Just a bunch of cement and two-by-fours, right? 
What the hell was I thinking, letting myself believe that things were finally different here, that this country had turned a corner? 
The bus is from the American school. 
They are heading into the city from the Okavango. 
There is only one of two roads they can go. 
I'm seeing patrols on both. 
Sir, this is Patrol One. 
We have not seen a bus matching that description. 
 Where is your position? 
 Heading east, one kilometer west of Okavango Junction. 
Jack, they're right in front of us. 
Let me know when you have them. 
Everybody hold on! 
Hold on! 
Chattering ] Quiet. 
What is it? 
Rebel patrol. 
Carl, we can't get back on that road. 
We'll walk to the embassy. 
If we follow the river, it'll take us to the city. 
 Desmond will not make it that far. 
 Then you help him, Thomas. 
We're not getting back on that road. 
Where are we going? 
 To the embassy. 
Let's go! 
Quickly! Quickly! 
Hurry up. Hurry up. 
Quickly. 
Quickly. I'll take him. 
I'll take him. 
Take this. 
Take this. 
Stay here. 
 Willie! 
Willie, hurry up! 
Your wife will be out in a minute. 
She'd better be, or she's gonna be late for her inauguration. 
What's going on in there? 
Well, I really can't discuss that, but, of course, when your wife comes out... 
you're certainly free to ask her. 
I asked you a simple question, Tom. 
If you can't answer it, fine. 
But I don't need your permission to talk to my wife. 
Well, I would hope not. 
If you will excuse me, I have to continue packing up my office. 
The decision book. 
Master protocols for the command and control... 
of our nuclear arsenal. 
I never knew how much I didn't know till I read that book. 
Are the gold codes in here? 
Not yet. 
Dan Wilcox will deliver them to your designate. 
All right then. 
Well, if we're finished here I should get going. 
Join me for a drink, a toast to your administration. 
As much as I'd like to, it's still a little early in the morning. 
 You sure? 
 Yes. 
To your administration. 
Thank you. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Please extend my gratitude to your transition team... 
for all they've done. 
You know what the talking heads are saying? 
They're saying that I lost this election because I didn't want to win it. 
They're saying that... 
my heart wasn't in it. 
What about you? 
Me? 
Do you agree with their opinion? 
I don't believe there's a simple answer to that question. 
You are right. 
Nothing about this job lends itself to simple answers, just, uh, jagged edges and moving parts, most you won't even see coming till they've smacked you in the head. 
So, uh, be careful, Madam President. 
See you at the inauguration. 
Indistinct ] Are you all right? 
I'm not sure yet. 
Gentlemen. 
We just got word of a coup in Sangala. 
Daniels has ordered the embassy to evacuate without even consulting me. 
Is it the right call? 
Right or wrong, he should have brought me in on the decision. 
Maybe he's still bitter about the election. 
Noah Daniels isn't that vindictive. 
You think he has a reason for pulling out of Sangala before you take office. 
Maybe. 
I'll call Ethan from the car. 
If Daniels is hiding anything about Sangala, he'll be able to dig it up. 
It's definitely the bus from Okavango. 
They were here not too long ago, at least a dozen boys. 
I don't care how many boys. 
How many men? Just Benton? 
 Or is he with that bastard that killed my brother? 
 There were two men. 
 Along the river would be their fastest route. 
 Good. 
Colonel Dubaku, I am sorry to hear about your brother, but I need you here. 
Are you ordering me to stay? 
A campaign is just beginning, and you are critical to its success. 
There will be time for you to avenge your brother after we have taken power. 
The man who killed my brother... 
is heading toward the American embassy. 
They are evacuating within an hour. 
That is all the time I have and all the time I need. 
Sir! 
Excuse me, General. 
Sir, the men are ready, sir. 
Go. 
Go. 
President-elect Taylor... 
will make her way to the steps of the U.S. Capitol where, 
standing before thousands of American citizens and Is this everything, Mr. Whitley? 
You've been stealing financial records from your office. 
Those files are private property and I'm here to recover them. 
Is this everything? 
Uh, look, I-- I saw something didn't look right, took it home to check it out. 
It's probably a mistake Just calm down. 
Answer my question. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
That's everything. 
It's all there. 
 What about your laptop? 
 Um, it's, uh  It's in my briefcase, if you want to check it. 
 Did you make any hard copies? 
No, I swear I-- I barely even looked at those files. 
 Who have you shown them to? 
 No one. NNobody. 
So, um, just erase it, take whatever you want, then you leave. 
Okay? 
Are we cool? 
Whoa. Whoa! 
Hey, do we look like fools to you? 
Huh? Do we? 
Do we? 
No! No! No! 
Then don't talk to us like we are. 
Okay Sit down. 
Open your shirt, Mr. Whitley. 
Why? 
Your shirt. 
What are you doing? 
You're going to tell us everything you know, and we'll know if you're lying. 
Just leave it alone, okay? 
Chris asked me not to tell anyone. 
I am not "anyone." 
Come on, Sam. 
I don't trust him. 
Then trust me. 
 We're here, sir. 
 You made great time, Edward. 
Look, I know that Chris is your friend. 
It's just this idea of you having a secret with him I gave him my word I wouldn't tell anyone. 
You need to respect that. Okay? 
Okay? 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Big turnout. 
It's crazy having a mother who's the hottest ticket in town. 
Vossler. 
It took some doing, but we managed to recover the files. 
What's our exposure? 
Unclear. 
We're working on it now. 
Find out and call me back. 
Hi. How are you? 
Clear. 
Willie. 
Take Desmond. 
That's it. 
Thomas, stay close, okay? 
Jack. 
There's a road through those trees, takes us to the city. 
We should be safe when we get there. 
You follow the riverbed. 
That'll take you to the border. 
You'll get there before dark. 
You sure? 
Jack, we'll be fine. 
Thanks for helping us get this far. 
Yeah. 
You take care of yourself.

We cannot follow them into the city. 
It's still under government control. 
Since when do you start giving orders? 
I spoke to Udo. 
He has some men... 
inside the city looking for him, looking for Benton and the other man. 
With the children they won't be hard to find. 
Well, I will find them and kill them myself, even if I have to go into the city. 
Go. Find them.

Father. 
Roger. Samantha. 
Nice to see you on time for once. 
Mm-hmm.  
How are you holding up? 
It still doesn't feel quite real. 
It will soon enough. 
Whitley needed some encouragement, but he told my man everything. 
How much does Roger Taylor know? 
 Nothing you need to worry about. 
 He knows Nichols was involved. 
All he knows is that his desperate, drug-addicted friend told him some crazy story. 
He's got no evidence. 
If he finds Nichols, he could find me. 
Not without evidence. 
Sir, Whitley's no longer a problem. 
We limited the damage. 
But you haven't eliminated it. 
Thank you. 
Keep your eye on Taylor. 
How much farther to the embassy? 
Two more blocks that way. 
But we only have 10 minutes. 
As soon as we get there I'm gonna give you the paperwork. 
Give that to Mr. Tramell. 
He's gonna take care of everything. 
Then you're not coming? 
No. 
Where's Mr. Benton? 
 He's not coming. 
 Why? 
He's dead! 
No! He was supposed 
to be behind us! 
He said he was coming! 
Willie. Willie! 
Willie! 
He lied! Why? 
Stop it! Stop it! 
He lied to me? Why? 
Mr. Benton 
did not lie. 
He made one promise to all of you boys-- to protect you and make sure you were safe. 
Mr. Benton died to make sure 
that Juma's soldiers couldn't follow us. 
Mr. Benton died 
to make sure you could get to the embassy. 
Mr. Benton died 
to make sure that you would be safe. 
I'm so sorry, but we have to go. 
It's what Mr. Benton 
would have wanted. 
Okay? You okay?

Stay right behind me! 
Stay behind me! 
Everybody hold on to the person behind you! 
Don't let go! 
Thomas, keep everyone together! 
Stay together! 
Stay together! 
Oh, please take us! 
Sergeant! I need 
to see Frank Tramell! 
He's expecting me! 
 Who are you? 
 Jack Bauer! 
We're almost there! 
Just stay with me! 
Everyone together. 
Don't worry, Desmond! 
We made it! 
We're going to America! 
Tramell! 
Listen to me! 
I've got 14 children seeking political asylum! 
All of them are R-1 status! 
One of them needs urgent medical care! 
Where's Benton? 
He's dead! 
Wait! Wait! 
I've got their paperwork! 
Show me. 
Keep Desmond up! 
There! 
It's all right. 
Stay with me. Come on! 
They appear to be in order. 
Good. Then open the gate 
and let 'em in! 
There's just one small problem They need the legal guardianship of a U.S. citizen. 
Guardianship? 
I already told you Benton is dead! 
He died getting these children here! 
Then don't let him have died in vain. 
Surrender to the subpoena, and the ambassador will waive the issue of guardianship. 
 Tramell, leave me out of this. 
 I'm afraid I can't do that. 
We are talking about innocent children. 
Whatever happens to them is all on you. 
You would leave these children out here in the street, knowing what you do about Juma? 
Damn it, Frank, they will be used as cannon fodder... 
or slaughtered in the soccer stadium for entertainment! 
I am giving you the chance to make sure that doesn't happen! 
The choice is yours. 
I don't have a choice, you son of a bitch. 
Open the gate. 
Hold on, boys! 
Hold on! 
Desmond, come on! 
No, no, no. 
You in first, Bauer. 
It's all right, Willie. 
It's all right. 
It's all right. 
Right. Take him into custody 
right now! 
Let 'em in! 
Let them in! 
Let them in! 
They're with me! 
Let 'em in, damn it! 
No! Those two 
are with me too! 
All of them! 
All of them! 
It's all right, Willie. 
Just go with them. 
Go with the soldiers. 
What about the choppers? 
All right, boys, come on. 
It's all right. 
Raise your right hand and repeat after me.

When the founders of our country... 
boldly declared America's independence to the world, they knew that they derived their power to govern... 
from three basic human rights life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
Today... 
we rededicate ourselves... 
to the preservation of those inalienable rights. 
But even as we carry forth... 
the torch lit by those great men, we need to remember... 
its light doesn't always shine as brightly as it should. 
It flickers and grows dim... 
because of apathy, greed... 
and fear. 
De Tocqueville said, "In every democracy... 
the people get the government they deserve." 
Today... 
I am asking each of you... 
to help me give you... 
the government you deserve. 
We all share the responsibility... 
history has placed in our hands. 
The future Our future... 
depends on it.
