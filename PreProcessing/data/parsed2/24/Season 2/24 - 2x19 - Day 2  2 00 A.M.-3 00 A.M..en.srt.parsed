Talk to me. 
Jack made it clear that the only way to get proof is if CTU stays out of it. 
 We don't know if he's alive! 
 He's on an open channel. 
You can't trace it, but you can talk to him. 
 Michelle! 
 No, Jack, it's Tony. 
The president asked me for proof that the Cyprus recording was fake. 
The man who can provide proof will only deal with me. 
How do we know he's not using you? 
Ten commandos tried to kill him to stop him making a deal with me. 
Jack. 
 I'm not gonna make it. 
 Just tell me where the evidence is now. 
It's on a memory chip. 
The source recordings prove the Cyprus audio is a fake. 
Where's the memory chip? 
Inside... 
Come on, Wallace. Inside where? 
Doctor! 
He's dead. 
We got the chip. 
Our planes are over the Atlantic. 
They will be reaching their targets in three hours. 
The secretary of defence wants to know how much longer you'll give Jack Bauer to disprove that tape. 
Jack Bauer has up until the time the planes start releasing bombs. 
From the secretary's point of view, that's tying the DOD's hands. 
We're gonna utilise every moment we have. 
 He's not gonna like that. 
 That's his problem. 
In order to exploit the advantages of a surprise attack, we've launched 12 bomb squadrons from three stateside bases. 
But initial air strikes will be launched from our bases in the region here, here and here. 
Your request was for air strikes to begin before your address to the nation. 
I know what I asked for. 
That came out wrong. 
You have done a remarkable job mobilising our forces on such short notice. 
Thank you, sir. 
Mr President, is it fair to assume that you�re still behind the attack? 
Cos I'm sensing some equivocation. 
I told the vice president, but I haven't shared this with the rest of you. 
Jack Bauer, the CTU agent most responsible for finding the nuclear bomb, believes the Cyprus audio is fabricated. 
 Bauer has no hard evidence? 
 Not at this point. 
This battle plan requires our surprising the enemy with a strike of overwhelming force. 
We will lose that advantage if we wait any longer. 
The target countries will mobilise their defences and our casualties will increase over the long term. 
 By how much? 
 Up to 20,000 troops. 
Then we have no choice but to proceed with the plan as stated. 
What I have to say to the president will have a direct impact on the meeting that he's in. 
 He can't be disturbed at this time. 
 Fine. Just make sure he knows I called. 
He's in a meeting with the Joint Chiefs. 
They won't interrupt until it's finished. 
Come on. 
 Almeida. 
 It's Jack. 
 Where are you? 
 I can barely hear you. It's a bad connection. 
 I want you to bring Wallace back here now. 
 Wallace is dead. 
But I got the evidence. It's a memory chip 
containing the original source recordings. 
 How do you know it's real? 
 He died trying to give it to me. 
He had it surgically implanted. I hardly think 
he'd have done that if it wasn't authentic. 
 Where are you? 
 In North Hollywood, 40 minutes from CTU. 
 We'll bring you the chip. 
 Call in your route. I'll send an aerial escort. 
I need you to get in touch with the president. 
He's in a meeting with the Joint Chiefs. 
Not until I confirm what you�re holding is real. 
Jack, come here. 
You've got to at least tell him what's going on. 
 I need you here, Jack. 
 Tony, can you hear me? 
 I hear you, Jack. 
 I gotta go. Please just do what I ask. 
 What? 
 We can't go anywhere with this chip. 
 Look at this, embedded in the silicon. 
 What is it? 
A transponder. It acts like a tracking device. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
Our group uses circuits like this to track sensitive material. 
I don't understand. 
Whoever Wallace stole the chip from tracked him to the warehouse. 
 They'll find us if I don't disconnect it. 
 Can you avoid destroying the audio file? 
 I think so. 
 Good. 
Danny, you have to stop doing this. 
I told you not to call. 
I'm sorry you're upset, but I don't have time for this right now. 
Why? What's going on? 
Nothing. Don't worry. 
We're taking care of things here. 
Really? What am I supposed to do? 
 Sit tight. I'll call you when I get a chance. 
 Forget it. 
Hey. 
Something's wrong with the phones. 
The network's been overloaded since news of the bomb broke. 
 Who were you talking to? 
 No one. What's going on? 
Jack just called. He says 
he's got the evidence from Wallace. 
 Does the president know? 
 We haven't confirmed it's authentic yet. 
The president's acting on the assumption that the recording is real. 
And this evidence may prove that it's not. I know. 
Tony, you've gotta call the president. 
I'm thinking about it. 
This is too big. 
I need something with a finer point. 
What about this? Will that work? 
Yeah. Good. 
 How much longer do you need? 
 A minute or two. 
 One or two? 
 One if you stop bothering me. 
Those people who want their chip back are here. 
Will the tracker still function? 
 The signal should still transmit. 
 I think I can lure them away from here. 
 You and Kate get the chip over to CTU. 
 Us? 
Don't worry. This is gonna work. 
Kate, move here against the wall. 
 Got it. 
 Bring it here. 
Still locked on target? 
This way. 
OK. I want you to meet me at Moorpark 
and Vineland, a few blocks west of here. 
If I'm not there in 15 minutes, leave without me, but you get that chip to Tony Almeida. 
 Be careful. 
 I'll be OK. 
Signal's dropping off. 
 Wait. He's moving. 
 Where? 
Just ahead. Toward the east entrance. 
I'll catch up. 
I waited till the meeting broke to tell you the governor called from Sacramento. 
 What's going on? 
 People are hitting the streets. 
He wants you to dispatch the National Guard like you did in Marietta. 
Mr President, Tony Almeida is holding for you on the emergency Satcom network. 
Why on Satcom? 
Since news of the bomb got out, network circuits have been overloaded. 
90%of all systems went down a few minutes ago. 
 I can talk to Almeida if you want. 
 Put him on speaker. 
Mr Almeida, this is President Palmer. 
You're also on with Mike Novick and Lynne Kresge. 
Jack Bauer just called with some new information. 
I'm a little conflicted about contacting you with this. 
He has evidence that proves the Cyprus recording is counterfeit. 
 What kind of evidence? 
 Source recordings of each of the men. 
 They were then reedited. 
 Have these been authenticated? 
 Not yet. We're getting 'em soon. 
 How soon? 
Within the hour, sir. 
Mr Almeida, your confidence in Jack Bauer is curious. 
An hour ago you told me he assaulted CTU personnel and took illegal custody of a witness. 
 He had no choice under the circumstances. 
 I don't follow. 
The man with the evidence would not have turned it over had Jack involved CTU. 
So what makes you so sure that this is any more real than the Cyprus recording? 
That's just it, sir. I'm not. 
 But Jack Bauer is. 
 Yes, sir. 
Thank you for your candour. 
I'll take this information under advisement. 
Thank you, Mr President. 
I'm calling off the attack. 
Sir, before you do that, we should talk through the consequences. 
We've talked enough, Mike. 
I appreciate your respect for Jack Bauer. I do. 
But you know the man's reputation. 
I know the man. 
Then start thinking about your own reputation. 
Meaning? 
A nuclear bomb was detonated on US soil. 
We've been shown proof connecting the weapon to three nations in the Middle East. 
Proof that may be false. 
Unless you respond decisively, your enemies will exploit that as a failure of leadership, as a sign of personal weakness. 
So what are you saying, Mike? 
That I should continue with a military operation just to prove that I'm decisive? 
 What if Jack Bauer's right? 
 What if he's wrong? 
Sir, we have all heard the Pentagon's assessment. 
Stopping and restarting military action could cost tens of thousands of American lives. 
An acceptable risk if the alternative is waging war against three innocent countries. 
Mr President, we know from past experience these countries aren't innocent. 
I'm urging you in the strongest possible terms to reconsider. 
I've made up my mind. 
Now get General Gratz back in here. 
Conference in the Joint Chiefs. 
They look fine. Send them to District. 
Excuse me. 
Hey. Look... 
I just wanted you to know that I told the president about Jack. 
 You did? 
 Yeah. 
If Jack has what he says he has, the president should know about it. 
How did he react? 
He wants us to keep him apprised of the situation. 
You did the right thing, Tony. 
We'll find out when Jack gets here with that chip. 
 When did he say? 
 About 20 minutes. 
When he does get here, make sure that thing is real. 
I'll pull up the CPB software right now. 
All right. Thanks. 
Tony. 
Yeah? 
Thank you. 
Yeah. 
All circuits are busy. 
Please try your call again. 
 Still no signal? 
 I have signal. 
 I just can't get through. 
 Maybe it's from CTU's end. 
I'm sure they're very busy gearing up for the war against my country. 
There won't be a war, Yusuf. 
They'll get the chip. 
 They're gonna know the truth. 
 Assuming they want the truth. 
They don't want war. 
You sure about that? 
You might feel differently if it was your family being threatened. 
 Vineland and Moorpark, right? 
 Yeah. 
I'll keep an eye out for Jack. 
 He's in the northeast quadrant. 
 Moving? 
 Just stopped. 
 Davis, where are you? 
Sweeping north along the east wall. 
He's inside the northeast corner. 
Pin him down. 
Yes, sir. 
 Do not kill him until I have that chip. 
 Understood. 
He took the tracker off the chip. 
Ronnie, he's running north toward Magnolia. 
Come on, let's go! 
All right, let's get him back inside. 
Is the president dedicated to this action? 
General, this was not a decision he made lightly. 
 I haven't been briefed on this. 
 The president will explain his decision. 
Until he does, you should brief your own staff. 
 All right. I'll take care of it. 
 Thank you for your patience. 
 More blowback? 
 And then some. 
Mike, have you heard anything about this meeting that the vice president called? 
A meeting? 
Apparently he's asked Cabinet members to be on hand an hour and a half from now. 
 What's the agenda? 
 I don't know, because I wasn't invited. 
 Who told you about this meeting? 
 Someone on Gendler's staff. 
He doesn't know anything more than what I'm telling you. 
Is it something to do with the president calling off the military strikes? 
Mike, what else could it be? 
 Did you tell the president about this? 
 No, not until I find out more. 
 For all I know, it could just be a rumour. 
 That's probably all it is. 
 I'll ask around anyway. 
 Keep me posted if you hear anything. 
 O'Hara. 
 Where's Stark? 
Right here. 
Get him up. Yes? 
Ronnie, you got the chip? 
I'm with the agent who took it off Wallace. 
 It was Jack Bauer, wasn't it? 
 Yes, sir. 
We've scanned his clothing and induced vomiting to check his stomach. 
It's a waste of time. He's not gonna 
have it on him. Let me talk to him. 
Yes, sir. 
You're on with Bauer. 
Jack, you're a hero here. Congratulations. 
Let me tell you what I wanna do. 
The world doesn't have to know anything about the arrangement we're about to make. 
 We'll keep it private. 
 Who am I talking to? 
Give me a break. Look, I need the chip. 
So let's not be pigs here, all right? 
You tell Ronnie where it is, I authorise a very large sum, large enough to compensate you for any guilt you might feel. 
It's not for sale. 
If someone wants to buy it, it is. 
How can you justify starting a war just to profit from the outcome? 
We're just controlling the chaos, that's all. 
No, you're causing it. 
Let's not waste each other's time trying to bridge our differences, OK? 
There's only one thing we need to agree on: a price. 
I already gave you my answer. 
When Ronnie's finished, you'll give me another. 
No, my answer's final. 
Ronnie! 
I think he wants to talk to you. 
I heard. I'll get you your answer. 
This man Bauer, I've read his file. 
 So have I. 
 You know he won't be easy to break. 
He'll break. 
 I appreciate your confidence. 
 I've earned it. 
Yes, you have. There's also a time issue. 
Then you'd better let me get started, sir. 
The chip, Jack. 
The chip, Jack. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 Yeah. 
 Jack's bringing a chip in. 
 That's what Tony said. 
He wants me to run point on the analysis. I'm 
having trouble accessing the CPB software. 
Just send it to my screen. I'll do it. 
I just need you to... 
unlock the indexing function. 
 I said I would do it. 
 I don't need you to do it. 
 I need you to unlock the indexing function. 
 What is your problem? 
 You've been gunning for me all day. 
 I could say the same about you. 
I'm just trying to do my job. 
Dessler. 
 Can I see you up here a second? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Just do what I asked. 
 Fine. 
 So what was that about? 
 What? 
You and Carrie, what were you arguing about? 
Nothing. I asked her to open some software 
and she's making me jump through hoops. 
I know you don't wanna tell me, but whatever bad blood there is between the two of you, I gotta know what it is. 
It doesn't matter, especially today. 
It does matter. It's interfering with your work. 
What's the problem? 
When I worked for Carrie over at Division, we were friends. 
I introduced her to my brother. 
He was married. He had kids. 
He left them for her. 
And then she got bored. She dumped him. 
Danny lost everything. His family, his job. 
It got so bad, he tried to kill himself. 
Look... 
It's unfortunate you two have to work together, but you do. 
And I gotta keep this office running today, all right? 
 I understand. 
 Good. 
Almeida. 
 Can I speak with Michelle? 
 Just a second. 
It's for you. 
 Dessler. 
 Your brother Danny's here to see you. 
Show him to my station. I'll be right down. 
Are we OK here? 
Yeah. 
Wow. This is nuts. 
Hey. Hey, little sister. 
Thanks for bringing him in. 
 How are you? You OK? 
 I'm fine. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I wanted to talk to you. 
 We were talking and you hung up. 
 I know. 
I tried to call you back, but the phones weren't working. 
So you came here at 2.30 in the morning. 
I don't have time for this. 
I wanted to apologise to you face to face. 
I'm sorry that I yelled at you before. I'm sorry. 
Apology accepted. But you have to go now. 
It's just this whole thing with the bomb. 
It's not just me. A lot of people 
are afraid of what's gonna happen next. 
Nobody knows what to do, you know? 
It's gonna be OK. 
We're taking care of things here. 
I know. I know you are. 
Why don�t you go home and get some sleep? 
I'll come over as soon as I can. 
 Ignore her. 
 You didn't tell me Carrie works here. 
She's not working here. 
We were short-handed. Danny, please. 
You don't return my calls? 
 Who are you? 
 My sister works here. 
 I've been in the middle of things right now. 
 I was just worried about you. 
 I was hoping you'd be worried about me. 
 Stop. 
 Why? You taking Carrie's side now? 
 Of course not. Come to my station. 
 Hey, come here. I wanna talk to you. 
 Danny! 
Why didn�t you call me back? 
Tell them I'm your brother, Michelle! 
Lynne. 
You were right about the meeting. 
Prescott's calling Cabinet members personally to set it up. 
Is it about the president calling off the attack? 
I don't know yet. My source at Defence says 
he has information. He agreed to meet me. 
 Who is it? 
 Jesper Isberg. 
He won't tell me anything over the phone. 
 When are you meeting him? 
 Now. 
Where? 
I don't think you should be there, Lynne. 
You might spook him. 
I brought you into this. I wanna hear what's 
going on before we take this to the president. 
There's a room upstairs, 522. 
It's used for storage. 
I'll meet you there. 
I'll be right back. 
Michelle? 
Where are you going? 
I was just going over to IT. 
I'm still trying to access the CPB software. 
IT's the other way. 
I just... I just need a minute, Tony. 
Hey. 
Carrie's gonna be fine. 
Is she gonna... 
Is she gonna press charges? 
No, I don't think so. 
It's all my fault. I should've seen it coming. 
It's family. These things happen. 
You can't see it coming. 
He's my brother. I mean, his kids... 
Maybe I should have told him about the bomb. 
It was a tough choice, but you made it. 
And, by the way, you were right. 
No. 
Nothing I've done today is right. 
Michelle. 
All these people today that are dead. 
And then this recording. 
I don't know if we're right about that. 
I can't... I can't do this any more, Tony. I can't. 
Michelle. Come here, come here. 
I'm so tired. I'm so scared. 
It's OK. 
It's OK. It's all right. 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
Tony. 
Chapelle's looking for you. 
Yeah, OK. 
Jack? 
Jack. 
Come on, Jack. 
You're gonna kill him. 
You can't keep doing this. 
Don't ever touch me again. 
 Yes? 
 Have you made any progress? 
 We're still working on him. 
 I told you, there's a time issue. 
Yes, sir. You told me. 
You do not wanna disappoint me on this. 
Get me that chip, Stark. 
I will. 
 So where's this person we're meeting? 
 He'll be here soon. 
Have you heard anything else about why Prescott called this meeting? 
We knew there�d be consequences, Lynne, dissent within the administration, but nothing like this. 
Like what, Mike? 
What do you know about Section 4 of the 25th Amendment? 
It provides that if the majority of his Cabinet feels he's unfit to fulfil his duties that the president could be removed from office. 
And the vice president becomes acting president. 
Prescott can't do that. 
Mike, we're talking about a palace coup. 
 Jesper Isberg? 
 Yeah. 
Give us a moment, please. 
Before we talk to him, I need to know where you stand vis-�-vis the president's decision. 
Are you questioning my loyalty? 
There's going to be a lot of lobbying among the Cabinet. I need to know where you stand. 
I may not agree with the president's decision, but it was his decision to make. 
As far as I'm concerned, it's Prescott who should be charged with treason. 
Are you sure that's how you feel? 
Yes, Mike. 
I was afraid you'd say that, Lynne. 
Mr Isberg. 
I'm sorry. 
What are you doing? 
Where are you going? Mike? 
Oh, my God. 
You're with Prescott? 
Only because David wouldn't listen to reason. 
 You said so yourself. 
 Mike, you can't... 
We've been worried about his indecisiveness since he took office. 
And now it's going to cost the lives of 20,000 Americans. 
I can't let that happen. 
I'm doing this for the good of the country. 
Lie to yourself all you want. 
Don�t you dare lie to me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Mike, this is not... 
What are you doing? Mike! Mike! 
Open this door! 
Open this door! 
Until you hear from me  only me - do not let her out. 
Understood. 
Open this door! 
Open this door! 
The White House confirms the explosion. 
The president will address the nation shortly. 
Police have reported a number of hate crimes against Middle Eastern businesses. 
Authorities are urging people to stay inside their homes and off the street. 
 Jack said to leave without him. 
 Let's give him another minute. 
We've given him much longer than he asked for already. 
We have to get this chip to CTU. 
They're expecting it. 
What if Jack needs our help? 
Getting this to CTU is the priority. 
 You OK? 
 Yeah. You? 
Yeah. 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
He's a damn towel head. 
Your people tried killing us with that bomb. 
You're not getting a second chance. 
Get back. Get back, put your hands up, 
get down on the pavement. 
Facedown! Hands where I can see 'em! Now! 
 Do what he says. 
 Your turn. 
Get down. 
Kate, get back in the car. 
Yusuf! Behind you! 
No! 
Think twice next time you come here! 
Stop it! You don't know what you�re doing! 
Chapelle. 
Ryan, it's Tony Almeida. 
I was told you were trying to reach me. 
Thanks for getting back to me so soon. 
Congratulations on the promotion. 
I wish it could have been under better circumstances. 
 Yeah, Mason was a good man. 
 Yeah, he was. 
 We're pretty busy around here. 
 I just wanted to give you a headsup. 
 About what? 
 I'm on my way over from Division. 
Why? 
I thought you could use some help, with all that' s going on. 
We're doing pretty well here, Ryan. Thanks. 
I'm sure you are. I'll see you in 30 minutes. 
 Dessler. 
 Hey. 
Have you heard anything about your brother yet? 
Yeah. They sedated him. 
They said they'd call me when he wakes up. 
 How are you holding up? 
 OK. 
 You? 
 I'm OK. 
Listen... 
About what happened before. 
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have... 
No, don't. Don't be sorry. 
I'm not. 
Really? 
Really. 
 What about Carrie? 
 Don't worry about Carrie. 
I know her. She's not gonna let this go. 
It's none of her business. It's gonna be OK. 
All right. 
Wake him up. 
 We should probably give him a minute. 
 Wake him up. 
You've been on this side before, Jack. 
You know everybody has a limit to how much they can take. 
Everybody has a breaking point. 
Even you. 
I understand you've got a daughter. Is it Kim? 
You wouldn't want Kim to be an orphan, would you? 
Hit him. 
Again. 
He's no good to us dead. 
Wake him up. 
Wake him up. 
 What's the problem? 
 He's not responding. 
 He's dead. 
 Cut him down! 
Outta the way! 
Get some epinephrine! 
Clear his airway. 
 Where's that epinephrine? 
 There isn't any. 
Go find some!
