Who is it you're looking for? 
Someone who can give me the names of everyone else involved. 
I need you to write the story in case I don't make it. 
If Dalia Hassan finds out that the Russians had a hand in the death of her husband, she'll never sign the agreement. 
MEREDITH: I need to speak to your mother. 
It's about the people who really murdered your father. 
We know who is responsible. 
What you don't know is, those people were working under the orders of Russian agents. 
Bauer made contact with Meredith Reed. 
My God. 
You need to call her publisher and demand that they do not run the story. 
You're suggesting muzzling the press? 
If you don't use the power of your office to shut this story down, your peace agreement won't be the only casualty. 
I need you to contact the FBI. 
Have them locate Reed and seize whatever evidence she purports to have. 
Meredith Reed? FBI. 
You're under arrest. 
Let's go. 
But I... 
You were right about Jack. 
He is working with somebody. 
It's James Ricker, ex-CIA op. 
We found him living in a place on Mercer Street. 
He's not gonna be happy we tracked him down. 
I need you to talk to him. 
Get him to tell us where Jack is. 
Are you good with that, or have you still not taken sides? 
I want to expose this cover-up as much as you. I'm in. 
(tires screech, horn honks) That's Jack Bauer! 
(coughing) Get up. I could just 
kill you right here. 
Do you know the name of the person inside the Russian government who's giving the orders? 
I want that name. 
Jack. 
Give me the name! 
I'll tell you. 
Four. 
Three. 
Mikhail Novakovich! 
Where's Novakovich? 
He's dead. 
Bauer just came in shooting. 
Mikhail Novakovich was just murdered by Jack Bauer. 
What? 
LOGAN: As far as, uh, Bauer is concerned, the trail ended with Novakovich. 
Then Bauer has no idea that Novakovich was operating under my orders? 
None. 
If you're so worried about Bauer, you never should have given the order to kill Renee Walker. 
(phone ringing) Arlo. 
Cole, I just picked up a preliminary flash. 
Jack murdered Novakovich at his hotel, and six of his security guards. 
According to a witness, Jack killed all seven men on his own. 
Then fell right back off the radar. 
Eden can't find any trace of him. 
Does Chloe know about this? 
I just talked to her, and she should be at the U.N. any minute. 
Cole, I know that we need this evidence that Jack has, but this crime scene is a slaughterhouse. 
Does Chloe really still think she can pull this off? 
If anyone can talk Jack down, it's Chloe. 
And if she can't? 
Then we're both prepared to do whatever it takes to stop him. 
Even when Novakovich's whole security staff couldn't? 
What do you want me to do, Arlo? 
The truth about what went down today needs to get out, and that's not going to happen unless we get to Jack. 
Look, I'm coming up on Ricker's apartment. 
I'm going in. 
Cole. COLE: What? 
Ricker went to a lot of trouble to disappear. 
He's not going to like that you found him. 
I'm not expecting him to. 
TV REPORTER: You're looking at the U.N. Plaza gardens 
and the podium from which all three co-sponsors of the peace treaty will address the public following a private signing ceremony inside the U.N.'s 
Council Chamber. 
Russian President Yuri Suvarov, the third co-sponsor of the treaty, is en route to the U.N. 
where he will join President Taylor and acting IRK President Dalia Hassan... 
(computer alarm chimes) (alarm chiming stops) (knocking) COLE: Mr. Ricker, 
this is Agent Ortiz, CTU! 
Open that door. 
(gun cocking) Before you pull that trigger, there's something you ought to know. 
I don't place a call in 15 minutes, every intelligence agency in the country gets alerted about you. 
Weapon charges alone will get you locked up for the duration, Or you can help us find Jack Bauer, and we'll keep our mouths shut. 
You think you're protecting him? 
The order on Jack Bauer is shoot to kill. 
He knew what he was getting himself into. 
Jack's not thinking straight. 
Look, I read your file. 
I know Jack saved your life in Damascus. 
This is your opportunity to pay back that debt. 
You know how this is gonna end, right? 
Do you? 
If Jack dies today, it's on you. 
Hey. 
Wait a minute. 
Wait a minute. 
(garbled radio transmission) Thanks, Adam. 
(text alert tone) Director O'Brian, Agent Burke. 
I have the revised security assessment for you. 
Ma'am, I noticed that Agent Ortiz's name was back on the duty roster. That's right. 
He was arrested for helping Jack Bauer. 
I got him a temporary clearance so he could help us out here. 
He was the one who designed the U.N. protocols 
in the first place. 
I know. 
Do you really think we can trust him? 
I wouldn't have gotten him a release if I didn't. 
(phone ringing) Yes, ma'am. 
Excuse me. 
(Burke clears throat) What happened? 
COLE: Not good, Chloe. 
I think Jack's targeting Suvarov. 
Is that what Ricker said? 
Yeah. Jack planted a bug 
on Charles Logan, overheard a conversation between the two men. 
Turns out Suvarov's the one who gave the order for Renee to be killed. 
(sighs) Does Ricker have a recording of that conversation? 
No. He wiped his system clean 
as soon as he saw me coming. 
But the surveillance rig he gave Jack records everything to a backup, so Jack has a copy. 
Good. We're 
gonna need it. 
Why? 
The White House just arrested Meredith Reed. 
They confiscated a data card from her. 
Dana's evidence. 
Exactly. The recording 
that Jack has is the only proof we have now. 
(sighs) Chloe, I don't know that getting proof is our first priority anymore. 
We have to put an alert out on Jack. 
If we do that, then Pillar will get to him first. 
He'll kill Jack, and he'll destroy the recording. 
Chloe, we can't stand by and let Jack assassinate the president of Russia. 
No, but we can buy ourselves time. 
Can change Suvarov's motorcade route, sequester him in the U.N. 
Make it impossible for Jack to get to him. 
Yeah, except Suvarov's gonna be standing at that podium soon, and once he's exposed like that, we can't protect him. 
That's not happening for over an hour. 
If we haven't found Jack by then, then we can put out the alert. 
It's still taking a big risk, Chloe. 
I know. 
All right, get Suvarov's route changed. 
But you're putting me in charge of his security as soon as he gets to the U.N. 
How far out are you? 
I'll be there in ten. 
(car engine starting) (tires squeak) (garbled radio transmission) Okay. 
Sir, the flash about Novakovich is going out. 
You wanted to speak with the president before that happened. 
Ah. 
(exhales) Thank you, Jason. 
Oh, um... 
do we know anything about Bauer? 
No. Nothing. 
If you don't mind me asking, sir. 
What are you going to tell the president? 
I think it's time she... 
she knows everything. 
All the delegates are present with the exception of Suvarov, who's still in transit. 
He'll be given the details once he arrives. (phone ringing) 
Excuse me, Tim. 
Yes, ma'am. 
I'm about to go into the protocol meeting. 
What's going on? 
I wanted you to hear this news from me first. 
What news? 
I tried to insulate you as long as I could, preserve your plausible deniability, but... 
Just tell me what you're talking about, Charles. 
Jack Bauer isn't just trying to gather evidence about the conspiracy. 
He's... 
He's seeking retribution. 
Go on. 
Bauer just murdered Mikhail Novakovich, along with a good number of his staff. 
(whispering): So Novakovich was responsible for the assassination of President Hassan? 
Yes. Yes, ma'am. 
Novakovich was the ranking member of the Russian Delegation. 
President Suvarov is going to demand an explanation. 
Actually, he's not. 
Are you telling me that Hassan's murder goes all the way up to Suvarov? 
Yes. 
But the good news is that Bauer doesn't know that. 
How can you be sure? 
Because according to a witness, Bauer killed Novakovich before he could talk. 
And aside from me, Novakavich is the only person who ever knew that Suvarov was calling the shots. 
Madam President, Bauer's finished what he started, an-and Suvarov will be happy to sweep this under the rug. 
An-and the peace agreement can go forward as planned. 
This is... 
Really, we couldn't have asked for a better outcome. 
Except that I am asking Dalia Hassan to shake hands with her husband's murderer. 
Madam President... 
Call Suvarov. 
Tell him that I am aware of his involvement in this, and that I will see him at the signing. 
(snaps cell phone shut) My apologies. 
Thank you for waiting. 
How did the call go? 
I told the president about Suvarov's involvement, and, um... 
she understood- not that she has an alternative. 
Well, that's good news, sir. 
PILLAR: Your new Secret Service detail's here to escort you to the U.N. 
Thank you, Jason. 
It's been a long road, but, uh... 
(chuckles): we're almost there. 
(Logan groans) (slaps car twice) (phone auto-dialing) Anything new on Bauer? 
A security camera picked him up leaving Novakovich's hotel. 
Confirmed what Berkov told us. 
Bauer was definitely wounded during the attack. 
How badly? 
Badly enough that he's gonna need treatment. 
Getting alerts out to medical facilities now. 
All right, also let Port Authority and INS know Bauer might be trying to get out of the country. 
We'll find him- it's only a question of time. 
Maybe a little quicker than you thought. 
Slowly, take your weapon out and pass it back to me. 
Slowly. 
Start the car and drive. 
You saw what I did to Pavel. 
I didn't have a lot of time with him. 
You, I've got all the time in the world. 
So you either do what I say, or I will take you apart piece by piece. 
Now, drive! 
(panting) Where are we going? 
The U.N. 
Why? You already 
got what you wanted. 
You killed everyone involved. 
Save your breath. 
I know about President Suvarov. 
Your delegations will be joining you at the reception after the post-signing ceremony. 
And finally, on behalf of the U.N. staff, 
I would like to say that we are all honored to be part of this historic occasion. 
Thank you for your time. 
Your daughter's been waiting inside to speak to you. 
She says it's important. 
(exhales) Let her know I'll be right there. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Madam President. 
I have something for you. 
It's from Omar. 
He wanted to give it to you to sign the agreement, and... 
I'm grateful that I can do so on his behalf. 
It reads: "All religions, "all this singing, "one song, peace be with you." 
It is a verse Omar would quote from Rumi when he was talking about what you and he were trying to achieve. 
Thank you for seeing this through and for helping us all do justice to his memory. 
Dalia, I am... 
I am honored. 
I'm very honored. 
Th Kayla, what is it? 
Meredith Reed called the residence looking for you. 
I am not interested in that woman's condolences. 
That is not why she called. 
She says she has information about the people who are behind Father's murder. 
But we know who was behind your father's death extremists in our country. 
(whispers): She claims that they had outside hKYp. 
That the Russians were involved. 
Why would she say such a thing? 
Does she have evidence, or is this just a rumor? 
I don't know, but it can't have been easy for her to call you. 
I don't think she would have done so because of a rumor. 
What else did she say? 
She wouldn't say anything more until she talked to you. 
She left her number. 
Let's call her from the residence. 
(indistinct radio transmissions) Ann, President Suvarov's motorcade is delayed five minutes because of the new route- put out an all-agency. 
How do you want it coded? 
Eyes only. 
Yes, ma'am. 
(sighs) Lanza, make sure Burke reports here with a set of tactical gear for Agent Ortiz. Yes, ma'am. 
Arlo's at CTU, running the surveillance video through facial recognition software. 
Still no sign of Jack. 
Look, I've been thinking. 
Let's say we do get this recording from Jack. 
What are we supposed to do with it? 
I mean, if the president's willing to lock down Meredith Reed... 
She can't shut down every media outlet in the world, which is where we're gonna send this file. 
We're also gonna send it to every government employee in the country. 
Legislative, military, judiciary that's over a hundred thousand people. 
How are we doing this? 
By using CTU servers, we can distribute it simultaneously to everyone. 
President Taylor won't be able to stop the truth from getting out. 
Burke. 
Good to see yo Sir. 
Did you use the revised protocol for President Suvarov's arrival? 
Yes, ma'am. 
We're now bringing the motorcade into the FDR Drive ramp. Good. 
Make sure that Agent Ortiz has the revised protocols. 
He's back in charge. 
Let's take a look. 
We're going to the Hart Building. 
I want you to park underground. 
This guard's life is in your hands. 
You make one move that I don't like, I'm gonna kill you both, you understand? 
Jason Pillar. 
There's no one inside. 
They left the building two hours ago. 
Yeah, I'm just running a last-minute security check. 
Of course, sir. 
Is there anything else, sir? 
No. Thank you. 
Drive. 
(grunting quietly) (panting) Pull in over here. 
Slowly, with your right hand, take the keys out of the ignition and pass them back. 
Get out of the car. 
(panting) Now! 
Close the door. 
Put your hands on the roof. 
Don't you move. 
Suvarov's not gonna be out on the podium for another hour. 
You're not gonna make it that long, not the way you're bleeding. 
(panting) Slowly, back up towards me. 
Stop. Turn around. 
Good. 
You're gonna suture me up. 
(groans) You try and make a move on me, the slightest twitch, I will put a bullet in your brain. 
You got it? 
Yes. 
(groans) (Jack panting) (gasps) I don't understand something. 
You've spent your entire career working outside the system; you've always had a good reason. 
But this... 
it's just blood lost. 
You're destroying an agreement that took years to put together. 
An agreement made by murderers and liars. 
(gasps) Murderers? 
You're the one killing people in cold blood. 
Everybody I took out had a hand in today's attack. 
But who makes you judge and jury? 
President Taylor, when she agreed to the cover-up. 
I would have accepted justice by law... 
but that was taken away from me by people like you. 
So you're right I am judge and jury. 
Now, step back. 
Turn around. 
Start to move back towards the car. 
Look, I came in after Hassan and Renee were killed. 
I didn't have anything to do with that, you have to believe me. 
Get on your knees! Please, 
Bauer, I'm telling you the truth. 
I've got a family; I've got a little girl. 
Shut up. 
Please... 
(muttering): I'm telling you the truth. 
(grunts) (loud thump) (panting) (yells) Still no answer. 
Are you sure this is Meredith Reed's number? 
It's the number she gave me. 
Then why isn't she answering? 
I just talked to Gary Klausner, Ms. Reed's editor. 
He doesn't know where she is and has no way to reach her. 
He seemed very anxious to get off the phone. 
Where are you going? 
President Taylor and I are supposed to be sitting across the table from Yuri Suvarov in less than an hour. 
If his government was involved in murdering your father, President Taylor needs to know. 
TV NEWS ANCHOR: Following the death of Omar Hassan, President Suvarov was reportedly pessimistic about the viability of the peace treaty. 
But rumors of a Russian withdrawal were soon dismissed by the White House, and President Suvarov is expected to arrive at the U.N. shortly. 
(knocking) Yes? 
Excuse me, Madam President. 
It's Dalia Hassan. 
I'll have to call her back. 
She's outside, ma'am. 
She says it's urgent. 
Send her in. 
(clears throat) (footsteps approaching) (sighs) Madam President, forgive me. 
I have just heard something that is very disturbing. 
What did you hear? 
That the Russian government, or people within the Russian government, were involved in the murder of my husband. 
Where did you hear this? 
My daughter received a phone call from the journalist, Meredith Reed. 
Have you spoken with her yourself? 
No. 
I've tried everything, but I've been unable to reach her. 
I came here to ask for your help finding Miss Reed. 
I need to know if there is any truth in what she said. 
Dalia, we heard a rumor about the Russians being involved as well. 
And you didn't tell me? 
No. Because we looked into it 
and found that there was nothing backing it up. 
It was just a frivolous accusation. 
Whatever else she may be, Meredith Reed is not a frivolous woman. 
She came to me, someone she knew would have every reason to doubt her. 
(clears throat) Dalia... 
I know that you want answers... 
but we are signing the agreement in less than an hour. 
Madam President, I feel like you're not listening to me. 
Before I sign a treaty with people who may have murdered my husband, I need help finding this woman. 
Please. 
I will do the best I can in the time that we have left. 
I don't think I'm making myself clear. 
Until I determine if her allegations are true, I will not sign this treaty. 
Dalia... 
please, be reasonable. 
This is my position, Madam President. 
I will not change my mind. 
(inhales and exhales loudly) Then you... 
You leave me no choice. 
I had Meredith Reed arrested. 
Why? 
Because her allegations would be too damaging. 
That doesn't make any sense. 
You wouldn't arrest someone for making false allegations. 
Unless they aren't false. 
You knew! 
You knew the Russians were behind my husband's death, and you said nothing?! 
Dalia, I am so sorry. 
(sighs) It-it was an im-impossible situation. 
(sighs) I was trying to protect you. 
Protect me? 
You betrayed me! 
Dalia, we are about to complete the most important diplomatic action in generations. 
Your husband sacrificed his life to preserve this agreement... 
How dare you invoke my husband! 
He never would have stood for this! 
This treaty happened because he trusted you. 
And even though every fiber in my being wanted to go home and grieve, I carried on because I trusted you. 
But not anymore. 
I will not make peace with the people who murdered my husband. 
Or with you. 
There will be no agreement. 
I will be entering a formal complaint with the United Nations, demanding that you release Ms. Reed, 
and disclose whatever evidence you've kept from me and from the rest of the world! 
Stop! 
In one hour, you will stand beside me in the council chamber, and you will sign the treaty your husband and I agreed to. 
I will not! 
You will! 
Because if you don't, my administration will disclose hard, indisputable evidence that agents inside your intelligence service attempted to detonate a nuclear device on our soil, which will give me all the justification I need to retaliate against the IRK with the full force of the American military. 
It will be decades before your country recovers. 
But it doesn't need to come to that. 
All you have to do is sign the agreement. 
Dalia?! 
(door slams) (clattering) (panting) First they murder my husband, and now this woman who has lied to me is threatening my country! 
(panting) I don't see a way out of this, Madam President. 
We can tell the world what these Russian bastards did, and how President Taylor protected them. 
We can take our case directly to The Hague. 
There is no case. 
No proof to support any of these accusations. 
More important, there are President Taylor's threats to consider. 
We cannot dismiss them. 
Our military can protect us from incursion. 
And if necessary, we can reactivate our nuclear program! 
Giving your husband's enemies exactly what they wanted in the first place. 
In addition to providing her with even more of an excuse to launch a preemptive military strike against us. 
I don't care what President Taylor said; she wouldn't dare. 
Can you really take that chance? 
(phone rings) Yes? 
Thank you. 
Yuri Suvarov's delegation will be arriving any moment. 
President Taylor is expecting you there to greet him. 
(panting) CHLOE: Agent Ortiz? 
What's going on? 
I spoke with Arlo. 
He got a facial recognition hit on Jack. 
Where? 
Inside our perimeter. 
He's here, Cole. 
He's been careful to avoid all the security cameras, but Arlo found this. 
It's from the 22nd floor of the Hart Building across the street from the U.N. 
The software picked up his reflection. 
How did he get into the building? 
According to the logs, the only person that entered the building within the past 20 minutes was Pillar. 
Jack must have taken him hostage. 
The windows on the east side of the building give him a clean line of sight down onto the podium. 
I'm going to go find him. 
I'm going with you. 
You can't. 
It would just cause a fight. 
I'm the only one that Jack will listen to. And what if he doesn't? 
(sighs) Give me 20 minutes. 
If you don't hear from me, we'll follow through with our plan. 
Sound the alarm about Jack and secure Suvarov. 
20 minutes. 
Okay. 
And keep your comm open. 
I want to know what's going on. I can't. 
CTU is monitoring all frequencies. 
It's too risky. 
All right. 
At least take this. 
Thanks. 
Be careful. 
(switch clicks) (computer chirps) Where's O'Brian headed? 
She's running a last-minute perimeter sweep. 
By herself? 
Keep a real-time uplink open with Suvarov's security people. 
Let me know when it's up and running. 
Yes, sir. 
(sighs) Okay. 
(beeps) Hey. 
(sighs) As long as I can remember, every time I've had to talk to you, it seems, for one reason or another, I've started out by telling you how sorry I am. 
I'm not going to do that to you now. 
You're going to hear a lot of stories about what I've done today. 
Some of them may even be true. 
But no one, and I mean no one can tell you why I did what I did except for me. 
And a lot of good people died today. 
Not just President Hassan. 
Operatives from CTU, members of other law enforcement agencies. 
ReneWalker. 
Who I was very close to. 
Yes? 
Thank you. 
President Suvarov's motorcade has just rounded the corner. 
Was Mrs. Hassan notified 
of his arrival? 
I believe so, ma'am. 
Yes or no, Tim? 
Which is it? 
Is she coming or not? 
Why wouldn't she be? 
âª âª President Taylor, that we are all here together is a tribute to your persistence. 
Mrs. Hassan, I am 
sorry for your loss. 
I admired your husband very much. 
We're wanted upstairs for the press conference. 
Yes, of course. 
Mr. President. 
Dalia, I know that this is very difficult for you. 
There is nothing left for either of us to say, Madam President. 
(garbled radio transmission) Chloe O'Brian, Director of CTU. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Master key and building schematics you requested. 
(beeps) (applause) Good afternoon, fellow delegates and ladies and gentlemen of the press. 
The last 24 hours have been the most difficult in this long and challenging road that we've all traveled together to reach this moment. 
Now, the eyes of the entire world are looking to the leaders standing here with me now, ready to usher in a new era of transparency, honesty and trust. 
President Taylor, President Hassan President Suvarov have each risen to this challenge for the sake of world peace. 
And the treaty that they have created together represents the culmination of their courageous efforts. 
(applause) Agent Burke? 
Sir. 
I need you to assemble a ten-man squad and deploy them to Sector C-7. 
The Hart Building, sir? We 
already have men on post there. 
Not nearly enough if there's a threat anywhere along that corridor. 
Keep your men outside the building until you hear otherwise. 
Yes, sir. 
(sighs) (panting) âª âª (sighs) (gasps) What the hell are you doing here? 
You don't have to kill Suvarov. 
There's another way. 
Who else knows where I am? 
Please listen. 
Who else knows?! 
Cole and Arlo. 
If I don't get you out of here in ten minutes, Cole's gonna send in every agent we have. 
(panting) Jack, they're going to kill you. 
There's a standing order to shoot you on sight. 
I couldn't let that happen. 
You shouldn't have come after me. 
You're my friend. 
I didn't have a choice. 
Neither do I. 
(gagging) Don't fight it. 
(coughs) Don't fight it. 
(gasping for air) (gasping stops) (Jack sighs) (rifle cocking) (phone ringing) Jason, you watching this? 
Jason? 
JACK: I have a five-five-six rifle pointed straight at your head. 
Bauer. 
The bullet travels 2,900 feet per second. 
If you try and move, you're a dead man. 
Which means you need to do exactly what I say. 
Do you understand? 
(gasps) Do you understand? 
Uh, Jack, I told you everything I know. 
And you thought I believed you? 
(recorder clicks on) LOGAN (on tape): And aside from me, Novakovich was the only one who knew that Suvarov was calling the shots. 
(recorder clicks off) What do you want? 
I want you to call President Suvarov and have him meet you where you are as soon as the press conference is over. 
What am I supposed to tell him? 
Try the truth for a change. 
Tell him you've got credible intelligence about a threat to his life. 
Transcript by Addic7ed.com 
As we gather together for this great occasion, we must not forget that we all stand in the shadow of Omar Hassan's tragic death. 
But... 
the peace agreement we're about to sign will be his living memorial. 
His courage brought us all to this historic day, and his vision will continue to guide us as we move into the future... 
together. 
So on behalf of the people of Russia, I extend the open hand of friendship to my partners in peace: President Taylor, President Hassan. 
Thank you very much. 
(reporters shouting questions) SECRETARY GENERAL: There'll be time for questions after the signing ceremony. Please, please. 
DALIA: If there's nothing more, I will see you both at the signing. 
It appears I am not the only one who does not want to be here. 
Mrs. Hassan is distraught. 
Understandably- her husband was killed six hours ago. 
Is that why she refuses to look at me? 
She knows. 
A reporter told her of your complicity in her husband's murder. 
Dalia came to me. 
And you confirmed this journalist's allegations. 
I told her the truth. 
And yet, knowing what she knows, she's still here. 
Mrs. Hassan understands 
the benefits of peace. 
Because you helped her come to that understanding. 
Excuse me, Madam President. 
(speaking Russian) Whatever it was you said to Mrs. Hassan to keep her here 
must have been very convincing. 
Take your call, Yuri. 
(speaking Russian) Charles. 
Yuri. We need to talk. 
So talk. 
Uh, it's a sensitive matter; something that, uh, that can't be discussed on the phone. 
All right. 
SUVAROV: Come to my suite. 
LOGAN: No. You need to come to mine. 
SUVAROV: Why? 
LOGAN: Just trust me, Yuri. 
SUVAROV: Trust you? 
I don't need to remind you that it is in our mutual self-interest to make sure that certain secrets stay secret. 
Stop talking in riddles, Charles. 
I don't have time for this. 
There's a possible leak inside of your camp, which is why we need to discuss this in my office. 
I'll be right there. 
(phone beeps) I hope I was convincing enough for you. 
You're a world-class liar; I would have expected nothing else. 
What exactly do you think you're doing by killing Suvarov? 
Getting justice for Renee Walker? 
Yes, and for all the other people that died today trying to protect this country. 
Now, sit at the desk and keep the line open. 
Jack, the audio file you recorded- we can use it to expose Suvarov. 
We can use the CTU servers to distribute it to every government agency and media outlet. President 
Taylor's already censored the press. 
NSA's putting up firewalls. 
Arlo's working on getting through them right now. 
The president can't lock down every media outlet. 
(phone ringing) That's Cole. 
If I don't answer that, he's sending a TAC team in here. 
It'll be too late. 
I'm gonna finish what I've started. 
You've reached Chloe O'Brian's voicemail. 
Please leave a message. 
(phone beeps off) (indistinct radio chatter) Delta groups, this is base. 
Come in, Delta. This 
is Delta One. Go ahead. 
I need you to deploy all available TAC units to the 22nd floor of the Hart Building. 
I have intel on a possible sniper. 
You got I.D. on this hostile? 
Affirmative. 
It's Jack Bauer. 
With regard to Bauer, sir, the standing order is to use lethal force. 
The order stands. 
Copy that. 
We're on our way. 
Delta teams two and three, this is a priority mobilization. 
The suspect is Jack Bauer. 
Considered armed and dangerous. 
Maintain shoot-on-sight protocol. 
TAC AGENT: Copy that. We have 
authorization for lethal force. 
CHLOE: Listen to me, Jack. Please. 
Jack, put down your rifle, and let me walk you out of here before they get here. 
Killing Pavel and Novakovich was one thing, but killing Suvarov? 
The Russians will consider an assassination of their president on American soil an act of war. 
He facilitated a terrorist attack against this country. 
That's an act of war. 
He's a murderer. 
You're provoking a war with a nuclear-armed country. 
Shut up, Chloe! 
Or what? 
You're gonna kill me, too? 
These people need to be stopped. 
They need to be held accountable. 
They brought this on themselves. 
I don't need to remind you of the collateral damage you're causing. 
Not to mention the innocent lives that are at stake. 
(footsteps approaching) (knocking) Sir, uh, President Suvarov is outside. 
He says you're expecting him. 
Excuse me, sir? 
Yes. 
I heard you. 
Send him in. 
You're gonna start a war because you lost someone? 
This isn't about me. 
Renee wouldn't want you to do this. 
I said shut up, Chloe! 
You know she wouldn't. 
She would want you to use that data card to get justice. 
The last thing Renee would want is for you to start a war in her name. 
Jack, please, don't dishonor her memory like this. 
We should speak alone. 
Yes, of course. 
(panting) This person, the one you say is leaking information... 
who is it? 
SUVAROV (slowly): I'm talking to you. 
(Jack panting) Okay, we'll do it your way. 
But you got to promise me you'll see this through. 
Because there's no way I'm getting out of this building alive. 
Jack... You got 
to promise me that you will see this through and that you will do exactly what I say. 
I need to hear it! 
I promise. 
I'm, uh... 
I'm sorry... 
for calling you so urgently. 
I was, uh, mistaken. 
My concern appeared to have been unfounded. 
I- I got a call from my source just a moment ago. 
Um, um... 
his information was wrong. 
I'm so sorry for wasting your time, Yuri. 
Gregor. Vasily. 
LOGAN: See you after the signing. 
Find Pillar. 
Sweeping equipment 22nd floor! 
CHLOE: Jack, the TAC team's almost here. 
I just need to make it to mobile command. 
You won't even get that far; you won't make it out of the building. 
You and Cole found me first by circumventing CTU. 
If Logan hasn't figured that out yet, he will soon enough. 
CTU gave you a standing order with regards to me: to terminate with extreme prejudice. 
If you don't shoot me, that file's not going anywhere. 
You need to shoot me and shoot to kill! 
Point it at me. 
Point it! 
And when they come through the door, tell them you found me at the sniper rifle, I turned on you, and you opened fire. Don't ask 
me to do something I can't do. 
Damn it, Chloe, pull the trigger! 
We are running out of time. 
They are gonna find us soon. 
You said you'd do exactly what I would say, that you would follow this through. 
Now, pull the trigger! 
I can't! 
Yes, you can, and you will! 
Now, pull the trigger! 
No! 
Damn you, Chloe, pull the trigger! 
Jack... 
We are running out of time! 
Pull the trigger! 
Please don't make me do this. Chloe, I know 
how hard this is for you, but if you care about me at all, you will pull the trigger. 
Do it! Chloe, 
I'm sorry, I can't. 
pull the trigger! 
No, Jack! 
Pull the trigger! 
I'm not gonna do it! 
Damn you! 
(gunshot) (door bursts open) What happened? He 
drew his weapon. 
I shot him first. 
Jack Bauer's down with a gunshot wound to the upper chest. 
Send medical to our position. 
I repeat, Bauer is down. 
(phone rings) Chloe, I've been trying to reach you. 
Burke's reporting you shot Jack. 
I had to. Listen... 
I'm on my way there right now. 
No. 
I need you at mobile command. 
Tell me what's happening. 
I have the recording of Logan and Suvarov's conversation. 
Jack gave it to me. 
If he gave it to you, why did you shoot him? 
I'll explain later. 
Right now, you need to make sure that Arlo is ready to upload that file. 
Yeah, okay. 
Just... 
What's Jack's status? 
EMTs are working on him right now. 
Is he going to make it? 
I don't know. 
I'll explain everything to you when I get there. 
I'll see you soon. 
BURKE: Ms. O'Brian! 
NYPD found Mr. Pillar 
in the garage. 
He was locked in the back of his SUV. 
He wants me to hold you here. Why? 
He's been apprised of the situation, and he wants to debrief you. 
We can do it later at CTU. 
I'm still running security here. I'm sorry. 
Ms. O'Brian, he was adamant. 
I've got to get back to mobile command. 
Ma'am, his authority, comes from the president. 
If you want to make a call to the White House, we can do that. 
When will he be here? 
He's on his way up here now. 
Hmm, I'm sure it was a terrible ordeal, Mr. President. 
But they told me Bauer's down. 
It's over. 
No. No. 
It's not over, Jason. 
Bauer has a recording that implicates me along with Suvarov. 
How do you know? 
Because the son of a bitch played the damn thing for me. 
He must've put a bug on me somewhere when he attacked the car. 
For all I know, he has recorded every conversation I've had for the past two hours. 
I'm on site now. 
I'll recover whatever he's got. 
Hey! 
You're on the line here, too. 
If this evidence gets out, we all go down together. 
Yeah, I understand what's at stake, Mr. President. 
I'll call you back when I have the recording. 
Yeah. 
(exhales forcefully) Is he stable? 
Yes, sir. 
Sir, as you requested, I searched Bauer. 
We're still combing the site, but that's what we found so far. 
PILLAR: Are you sure that's it? 
BURKE: Like I said, sir, we're still sweeping. 
I believe this phone is yours. 
(under breath): Yeah. 
It's a, uh, digital recorder, sir, but it's clean. 
There's nothing in it. 
Come here. 
Excuse us. 
The data card is missing. 
Bauer has a digital file that poses a threat to national security. 
We need to find it. 
Yes, sir. We'll keep looking. 
PILLAR: What happened up here? 
He drew his gun and I shot him. 
What more do you need to know? 
Did Bauer give you anything? 
What would he have given me? 
Bauer had a digital recorder. 
The data card's missing. 
I thought you might know where it is. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
You didn't see him stash it anywhere? 
If I did, I would've taken it and already logged it as evidence. 
Then you don't mind emptying your pockets. 
Um... 
I just shot my friend, so... 
Unless you want me to do it for you, I need you to empty your pockets now. 
On what grounds? 
National security. 
Let's go. 
(sighs) If I search you, will I find that data card? 
This is ridiculous. 
Put your hands up here. 
I just told you, I shot Jack. 
Why would I be helping him? 
Sorry, Ms. O'Brian, I have 
to be absolutely sure. 
Okay. 
Hope you enjoyed yourself. 
(elevator bell dings) It's over, Jack. 
You need to talk to me; maybe do yourself some good. 
Where's the data card? 
(sighs) Is he stable enough to be treated at CTU instead of the hospital? 
He should be. 
He got lucky. 
It's a through and through. 
Through and through. 
Bullet didn't hit any of his organs or his arteries. If you're going 
to get shot anywhere, that's where you want it to happen. 
Son of a bitch! 
Get me mobile command. 
(mumbling) What? 
You got something to say to me? 
If you've got something to say, you'd better say it now. 
Talk to me. 
(panting, muttering) What? 
(whispering) (Jack grunting, Pillar screaming) (screaming continues) (spits) (yells) Get him out of here! 
(yells) Lock down O'Brian! 
(groans loudly) Arlo's ready to receive the file. 
Chloe, you need to tell me why you shot Jack. 
Jack said they'd suspect me if I didn't; He said my only way out of there with the evidence is to shoot him. 
Medical report said it went clean through. 
That no vital organs were hit. You're 
telling me you meant to miss them? 
How did you know you wouldn't kill him? 
I didn't. 
It's uploading now. 
It shouldn't take long. 
Chloe... 
I just need a few more seconds. 
What's going on? 
Just got orders to lock down Chloe O'Brian. 
What orders? 
Please step aside. 
I'm not going anywhere till you tell me what's going on. 
Sir, we're not going to ask you again. 
Step aside. 
Don't- I order you- stop! 
I'm ordering you to stop! Don't! 
Ms. O'Brian, is this 
the data card that Jack Bauer gave you? 
Yes. You need to listen 
to what's on it. 
Mr. Pillar will make 
that determination. 
Pillar is part of the cover-up. 
That data card will never make it to evidence. 
Please! 
Hold them here. 
Don't do this! 
Burke! 
Burke, stop what you're doing! 
Think about what you're doing! 
Burke, stop! 
(phone rings) Pillar. 
BURKE: Mr. Pillar, 
I locked down O'Brian. 
Looks like she was working with Agent Ortiz. 
He's in custody, too. 
Get the data card? 
Yes, sir. 
O'Brian was trying to upload the file to the main servers at CTU, but I stopped the transmission. 
Good work, Agent Burke. 
All right, send O'Brian and Ortiz to CTU lockdown and talk to no one. 
Get that data card to President Logan. 
Yes, sir. 
Take them to CTU. 
This is it. 
(sighs) This is the recording that Jack Bauer made. 
Bauer was working with Chloe O'Brian and a field agent called Cole Ortiz. 
They were planning to use CTU's servers to disseminate this recording to news organizations, and-and government officials and watchdog groups on a massive scale. 
It almost worked. 
My people, they never gave up, and now it's over. 
You won. 
Congratulations. 
Have you listened to this? 
Yes, yes, but frankly, it's not worth hearing. 
Where is Jack now? 
He's about to be transported to CTU under heavy guard. 
I realize that this is a difficult area, but the one thing we can be certain of is that Jack Bauer will never let this go. 
No. 
I don't suppose he will. 
All great achievements in state... 
are fragile things, Madam President. 
Especially in their infancy. 
They need to be protected. 
Our peace agreement very vulnerable. 
As long as Jack Bauer is out there, the agreement will never be safe. 
Then we will lock him away in a black site halfway around the world. 
He will find a way, Madam President. 
Mark my words. 
He will rise out of the deepest hole in the ground. 
He will claw his way back from the ends of the Earth, unless we stop him before that can happen. 
Pending approval, I have taken upon myself to, uh... put a plan in motion. 
Of course you have. 
I will take your silence as tacit approval. 
(door opens) (Taylor exhales sharply, door closes) (sighs heavily) (sniffles) (inserts data card into laptop port) A lot of good people died today, not just President Hassan. 
Operatives from CTU, members of other law enforcement agencies. 
Renee Walker. 
Who I was very close to. 
These people died today because President Suvarov wanted to destroy the peace treaty for his own interests, and President Taylor knows this because I told her, but she's willing to cover it up because she believes the peace accord will serve the greater good. (phone ringing) 
She is wrong; it won't. (sniffles) 
Yes. 
Both delegations are here, ma'am. 
What about the secretary general? 
He's just outside in the atrium. 
Thank you, Tim. 
(hangs up phone) (taps computer key) (sighs) Lasting peace cannot simply be political. 
It has to be born out of trust and honesty and understanding and most importantly, a will on both sides to move forward. 
Currently, that will does not exist. 
This peace is fraudulent, and I cannot in good conscience allow the people that lost their lives today to go unspoken for. 
Kim, you reminded me of that earlier today. 
That's who I am. 
(Taylor sniffs) (sighs) Bauer is being handled. 
Is it done? 
Yes, sir. 
All right, then. 
(both sigh) (pats back) You know, I wasn't sure the president had the balls to see this through. 
Clearly, I underestimated her. 
We both did, sir. 
(door opens) Good luck, Madam President. 
This calls for a celebration. 
Huh, a little something to numb that ear pain? 
(chuckles) What are you drinking? 
Whatever you're having, Mr. President. Yes. 
(pouring) You did well, Jason. 
You kept your eye on the prize. 
Thank you, sir. 
Here's to, uh, all the political capital the president is about to bank downstairs. 
And here's to helping her spend it. 
(quiet chatter) (whispering): I keep having to remind myself that we will be home tomorrow, and this day will be behind us. 
(applause) SECRETARY GENERAL: Ladies and gentlemen, please, please, please take your seats. 
Honored delegates and distinguished guests, on behalf of the United Nations, please allow me to welcome you to this great occasion of hope and peace. 
Today we bear witness to an extraordinary act in one of the world's defining dramas. 
If you would allow me now just to offer a few private words to those of us that are fortunate enough to be here now. 
May we all pledge to make the spirit of this moment... 
a new chapter in the history of all nations. 
The President of the United States of America, please, would you join me? 
The President of the Russian Federation and the President of the Islamic Republic of Kamistan, would you please join me? 
Before you is the final draft of the agreement that has been negotiated by you and your representatives in good faith. 
By signing its pages, you commit your respective countries to abide by the terms set forth therein, as stipulated by international law. 
President Suvarov, I believe you are to go first. 
(applause) SECRETARY GENERAL: President Hassan. 
(applause) âª âª (sniffs) âª âª Your husband wanted me to have this. 
I cannot accept it. 
Madam President, what are you doing? 
What I should have done hours ago. 
I urge you to stop what you are about to do. 
Mr. Secretary General, 
my fellow delegates. 
Grave crimes have been committed in the run-up to this treaty. 
I have participated in a conspiracy to hide those crimes. 
Before there can be a meaningful peace, justice must be served. 
(sniffles) I will be giving a more complete statement within the hour, but for now, this peace process has come to an end. 
(delegates murmuring) Contact CTU and have them alert Jack Bauer's medical transport. 
Madam President... 
He is about to be ambushed. 
Just make the call, Tim! 
We may already be too late. 
Dispatch, this is Tim Woods. 
I have an emergency. 
The convoy transporting Jack Bauer is about to be ambushed. 
Alert Medical One immediately. 
W- do it. 
(shuddering) Madam President, talk to me. 
Tell me what's happening. 
Ma'am. 
I have made a terrible mistake, Tim, one that I can never undo... but I need you 
to help me stop it from becoming worse. 
Yes, ma'am. 
(coughing) DISPATCHER (over radio): Medical One, this is CTU Dispatch. 
(coughing) Medical One, I have a priority call from Homeland Security. 
Come in, please. 
(Jack groans) (panting) (phone rings) This is Woods. 
Thank you. 
We didn't make it. 
They got Bauer. 
(groans loudly) My statement is brief, and I will take no questions. 
Moments ago, President Taylor declined to sign the peace accord and excused herself from the proceedings. 
She did so after making allegations of crimes which she did not specify, and which the United Nations has no knowledge of. 
President Taylor said that she would come forward within the hour to explain the reasons for her actions. 
Until then, please, direct all queries to the White House Communications Office. 
(phone ringing, press corps clamoring) TV REPORTER: President Taylor herself, after... 
(TV turns off) (phone ringing) That's the President asking about Bauer. 
(ringing continues) No. 
Let it ring. 
With due respect, sir, what good will it do? 
(ringing continues) It's over. 
Let's not add murder to the list of charges already against us. 
(ringing continues) You know what, Jason? 
You're right. 
Go ahead. Pick it up. 
(ringing continues) (Pillar clears throat) PILLAR: Hello? 
This is President Taylor. 
I need to speak to Charles Logan immediately. 
(blow lands) (groans) Charles! 
This was my last chance, and Bauer took it away. 
It's come to this because of him. 
(silenced shot) It's locked. 
(banging) Open the door, Charles! 
This is Tim Woods. 
I'm with the President on the 22nd floor. 
We need the master key to room 2206 immediately. 
(banging resumes) TAYLOR: Damn it, Charles! Open the door! 
(gunshot) Madam President, this way! Now! 
Tim, I need Logan alive! 
Can they save him? 
They think so, but Madam President, they're saying that even if he regains consciousness, he's probably suffered severe brain damage. 
He knew he was the only one who could locate Jack. 
Not necessarily. 
CTU's drones have been in the air for the last four hours. 
They may be able to back-trace Jack from the ambush site using archived surveillance video. 
Where is Chloe O'Brian? 
She and Agent Ortiz returned to CTU about ten minutes ago, under arrest. I want 
them released immediately. 
Tell Chloe to use whatever resources are at her disposal to find Jack. 
I've already done that, Madam President. 
Thank you, Tim. 
Thank you. 
EDEN: Let go of me! 
O'Brian, you have no authority. 
I don't know what you think you're doing. 
Shut up and keep moving. 
What the hell is going on? 
What the hell is going on? 
President Taylor didn't sign the agreement. 
She backed out at the last minute, but she had already ordered the hit on Jack. 
Did she call it off? 
She tried, but his ambulance has been ambushed. She has no 
way of contacting the hitters. 
How does she even know Jack's still alive? She doesn't. 
She's had everyone cleared from the floor except for you, me and Arlo. 
Arlo's redirecting the drone to over the ambush site. 
We just got police reports of an incident downtown. 
CTU convoy ambushed, three agents wounded, but they didn't find Jack's body on site. Can 
you pull up archived video of the same location? 
Already on it. 
COLE: When did this happen? 
ARLO: Five minutes ago. 
Shuttle forward. 
Come on, Arlo. 
Give me something. 
Okay, 30 seconds ago, the van pulled off of Delancey. 
Damn it. 
What? 
Lost it under the Williamsburg Bridge. 
Go to real time. 
âª âª ARLO: That's it. That's the van. 
Have NYPD send all units to the vicinity. 
They're never going to make it in time. 
Um... 
Okay, uh, hold on. 
Prepare for departure run-through with Team B in 20 minutes. 
I got this! 
Come on. 
Turn around. 
Turn around. 
Down on your knees. 
(panting and groaning quietly) I know who you are. 
So I'm going to make this, uh, quick and clean. 
Am I supposed to say thank you? 
(grunting) Stand down! Stand down! 
I really don't want to do this, but orders are orders. 
It's all right. 
Pull the trigger. 
Sir! 
Wait! Hold your fire! 
It's President Taylor. 
I don't have positive confirmation, but it sounds like her. 
She says CTU has a drone overhead. 
They're got a directed microwave signal. 
That's how they got through to the phone. 
Madam President? 
I am ordering you to release Jack Bauer immediately! 
Ma'am? 
You heard me! 
You and your men are to leave Mr. Bauer where he is. 
Stand down and withdraw outside the west gate until the FBI arrives. 
If you have any thoughts of fleeing before then, the drone is equipped with two AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. I will 
not hesitate to use them. 
Are we clear? 
Yes, ma'am. 
Now, put Mr. Bauer on the phone. 
Uncuff him. 
Sir? 
I said, "Uncuff him." 
(handcuffs unlocking) (panting) You're ordered to stand down and evacuate. 
We're rolling up and evacuating. 
Let's get in the van. 
Let's move. Now. 
The President wants to talk to you. 
TAYLOR (over phone): Jack? 
You should've let them kill me... 
...'cause I'm not going 
to quit until this is over. 
It is over. 
I withdrew 15 minutes ago from the signing of the peace treaty. 
Within the hour, I will tell the world what happened today. 
I will tender my resignation and remand myself to the attorney general... 
and face the consequences of my actions. 
Unfortunately, you will have to do the same. 
I wanted this peace so badly, Jack. 
And for that, I have betrayed every principle that I have ever stood for. 
And I betrayed you. 
If I had listened to you, none of this would have happened. 
We've both made mistakes we're going to have to live with. 
I would give anything to take back the time. 
But all I can do is tell you to leave the country while you still have a chance. 
The Russians will be coming after you. 
And so will we. 
Jack, I am so sorry. 
I don't know what else to say. 
âª âª (phone ringing) Jack? 
Chloe, the president just told me what was happening. 
She said she was going to give me a little time to try and get out of the country. 
I know. I was on the call. 
My daughter... 
her family- they're going to try and use her to get to me. 
I'll make sure they're protected. 
No. Chloe, you've got 
to promise me. 
You've got to promise me you'll keep them safe. 
I'll make sure they're protected. I promise. 
How much time do you think I've got? 
I don't know. 
I'll get you as much time as I can. 
Chloe... 
What? 
When you first came to CTU... 
I never thought it was going to be you that was going to cover my back all those years. 
And I know that everything that you did today was to try and protect me. I know that. 
Thank you. 
Good luck, Jack. 
Yeah... 
Bring the drone back to the base. 
Whatever happened here didn't happen. 
Understand? 
Shut it down.

Transcript by Addic7ed.com 
This is Meredith Reed. 
Ms. Reed, the people that you 
think are responsible for killing President Hassan were not working alone. 
They were being funded and managed by people working inside the Russian government. 
How do you know this? 
I'm being set up, just like you were yesterday. 
I need to get this evidence to you. 
Arlo got a cell phone intercept report off NSA's Echelon. 
Keywords: "Jack Bauer." 
PILLAR: We confirmed the voiceprint. 
Reed's connection to Hassan means she'd be highly motivated to help him. 
Take it to the press. 
That's his next move. 
This is a major opportunity to make everything go away, sir: Bauer and the evidence. 
I need to find Jack... 
or else they're gonna kill him. 
If we can get to him, we can expose the cover-up. 
Jack's gotta be working with someone. Who? 
I don't know. I never saw 'em, 
but Jack showed up with state-of-the-art weapons and comms. 
Pavel, do you see Bauer? 
If you have a shot, take it. 
I've got him. 
Put it down. 
Everything's all clear up on top, Jack. 
Come with me. 
Do exactly what I say. 
(shouting and screaming) Move! 
PILLAR: He knew it was a trap. 
The evidence is on this memory card. 
Take it. 
As soon as you see it, you'll know it's real. 
DANA: The hit on Hassan is all arranged. 
Bazhaev and his people are taking care of everything. 
I already know that you killed Renee Walker. 
What I want to know is the name of the Russian pig inside your government that gave the order. 
Where's the SIM card for your phone? 
You dumb bastard, you swallowed it. 
This is for my friend. 
(grunts, crunching) MAN: You've reached the mobile number of President Charles Logan. 
ANGELA: As a principal player in this unprecedented and historic peace initiative, Secretary of State Kanin's untimely decision to withdrew for health reasons was a difficult one. 
However, the president wishes it to be known that in Secretary Kanin's absence and per his own recommendation, she has sought and gained the counsel of former President Charles Logan. 
Now, the president is acutely aware that this decision bears some controversy. 
But President Logan's experience with foreign policy and his skills in negotiation have already proven to be a great asset in these final hours before the signing of the peace agreement with the Islamic Republic. 
Once Mrs. Hassan... 
Excuse me, Mr. President. 
...and the IRK delegation... 
Your car to the heliport is ready and waiting downstairs. 
Has, uh, President Suvarov's plane arrived yet? 
It should be touching down at JFK within the next 20 to 30 minutes, and then he'll be choppered in to the 93rd Street Heliport. 
Thank you, Ellen. 
Tell them I'll be down in a moment. 
Yes, sir. 
ANGELA (on TV): Once Mrs. Hassan 
and the IRK delegation have hashed out a few remaining points of protocol with President Taylor... 
(phone ringing) ...the signing will commence 
as scheduled. 
Tell me you have a lead on Bauer. 
PILLAR: I'm sorry, sir. 
We tracked him to an adjacent building, but Bauer managed to get out of the cordon, along with the reporter Meredith Reed. 
Also, he's killed Pavel. 
I've taken jurisdictional control over the scene from NYPD. 
We should be able to keep this contained, but it... 
it's not gonna matter if Bauer's already passed along the evidence he got from Dana Walsh to the press. 
The story's going to come out. 
No, not necessarily. 
We still might be able to manage this. 
Look, sir, I- I know you've told me that you're committed to seeing this through, but you can still extricate yourself from this mess. 
There's no evidence of your involvement yet. 
You can still delay the press announcement. 
It's too late for that, Jason. 
The White House Press Secretary just announced my role in the peace process. 
There is no turning back. 
And there's something else you should know. 
Bauer didn't just kill Pavel. 
He butchered him. 
He beat him savagely, and then he eviscerated him. 
I don't think Bauer's just looking to expose the Russians' involvement in the plot against Hassan. 
This guy's out for blood. 
Then you better find him and stop him, hadn't you? 
Yes, sir. 
Keep me posted. 
I'm not going any further till you tell me what happened back there. 
You killedhat man, dn't you? 
Ms. Reed, your 
life is in danger. 
You want to get through this thing alive, you're gonna do exactly what I say. 
Do you understand? 
Jack, I can't get a locate on the number you called from this phone. 
It's restricted. 
I'm gonna have to route a back trace. 
Can you do it here? 
No. I need the equipment 
at my place. 
Get back to me as soon as you got a location. 
All right. 
Let's go. 
Who is it you're looking for? 
Someone who can give me the names of everyone se involved. 
And what are you gonna do when you finthem? 
It doesn't concern you. 
How can I trust you if you don't tell me what you're doing? 
Because I'm not the person who's trying tkill y. 
The video file that I gavyou is the onlproof of the Russians' mplicity President Hassan's assaination. 
But the conspicy doesn end with the Russians. 
There are people within our own government that are trying cer this up, including President Taylor. 
Why would the president want this covered up? 
Because she's trying to keep the peace accord alive with the IRK. 
And she knows if Dalia Hassan finds out that the Russians had a hand in the death of her husband, she'll never sign the agreement. 
What do you want from me? 
I need you to break the story in casI don't make it. 
I think Presidt Hassan deserves that, don't you? 
Leme see your cell phone. 
Okay. 
Wait. 
at are you doing? I... 
They've seen you with me. 
The authorities are going to start monitoring your usual forms of communicaon. 
You can't go home, you can't go back to your office. 
Is there anyone that you work with that you trust? 
Uh, my edito Gary Klausner. 
You need to try and get him the evidence. 
I can get you as far as a pay phone. 
After that, you're on your own. 
I'm glad we were able to come to terms. 
So am I. 
Thank you, Madam President, for your pience with me. 
I am still new to this. 
You are a natural leader, Dalia, and you have a superb advisor in Minister Jamot. 
I appreciate the endorsement, Madam President. 
Pardon me... 
for interrupting. 
We were just finishing up. 
Dalia Hassan. 
Charles Logan. 
I'm honored to finally meet you, Mrs. Hassan. 
I was a great admirer of your husband. 
I'm so sorry for you loss. 
Thank you. 
President Taylor tells me you were instrumental in convincing the Russian delegates to stay at the negotiating table. 
I'm honored to play even a sll part in such an historic event. 
Madam President, may I have a few moments with you? 
I'll see you at the signing. 
You still haven't found out how Logan convinced thRussians to stay? 
I've investigated it, but I learned nothing from the delegates. 
I can have our intelligence service look into it. 
No. Thank you, Jamot. 
I trust President Taylor. 
We have to assume that if she involved Logan, it was for a good reason. 
The operation to capture Jack Bauer was unsuccessful. 
He got away, along with the evidence that he took from Dana Walsh. 
You said you had the situation under control. 
Clearly, I was overly optimistic. 
And in my optimism, I neglected to tell you that Bauer made contact wi a journalist. 
Meredith Reed. 
My God... 
You need to call her publisher right away. 
Deny any foreknowledge of whatever evidence she has, and demand that they do not run the sto. 
You're suggesting muzzling the press? 
Have you forgotten that freedom of the press is Constitutionally protected? 
You are the president, for God's sake. 
Invoke national security. 
You tell them this story will start a war. 
Innocent lives will be lost. 
New lies to cover the old ones. 
The time has passed for hand wringing, Madam President. 
If you don't use the power of your office to shut this story down, your peace agreement won't be the only casualty. 
You don't need me to tell you the damage that your criminal prosecution will do to this country. 
This country survived your presidency. 
But it won't survive yours. 
Me- I inherited my presidency. 
I was never nearly as popular as you are. 
And most of my alleged misdeeds never made the press. 
But if you were to bare your sins to the people who put you in office...? 
You are a beacon of righteousness, not only for Americans, but for the rest of the world. 
You are the president who had her own daughter arrested rather than see justice go unserved. 
You're a poison. 
I never should have let you to do this. 
With due respect, Madam President, I- I gave recommendations, I made whatever arrangements needed to be made. 
But every decision was yours. 
Let's not pretend otherwise. 
I've-I've studied you for a number of years, Allison. 
I pride myself on being a good judge of character. 
You're a smart woman. 
You've always known what needed to be done and were willing to do it. 
Which is why I know you will call Meredith Reed's publisher and make sure he kills the story. 
I would suggest you do it now. 
You, uh... 
You have a signing ceremony to prepare for. 
And I need to go meet President Suvarov. 
Chloe, you need to see this. 
What is it? 
I just tapped into a live feed from Pillar's team. 
This guy was found strung up and sliced open in an abandoned building across from the department store. He's got Russian papers 
on him, but I can't make 'em out; the rez is too low. 
Looks like someone left a sniper rifle at the scene. 
What's the caliber? 
Bring it up. 
They tagged it as a.308 Springfield. 
That's the gun that killed Renee. 
That's got to be the shooter. 
Jack did this, and you still think you're gonna be able to talk him down? 
I gotta try. 
Pillar and his people are just gonna kill him, and I can't let that happen. 
(beep) Got a match from the department store security feed- 82%. 
That's the guy helping Jack? 
Yeah, James Ricker Ex-Green Beret, Special Ops. 
He served with Jack in the Gulf before Jack was enlisted by CTU. 
Just one problem. 
He's dead. 
It says he was killed in a chemical plant explosion in Basra seven years ago. 
Yeah, well, then he must have a twin who was there when Jack reversed the ambush. 
You better go back to your station. 
Pillar's watchdog is getting suspicious. 
Arlo, cross-reference Ricker's photo with State DMV database. 
He must be living under an alias in the city. 
We find Ricker, we find Jack. 
Okay. 
(phone ringing) JACK: Yeah? 
You get the location? 
RICKER: You didn't tell me that was Logan's phone that I was tracing, Jack. Does it matter? 
Yeah, it kind of does. 
I think you know it, too, or else you would've been straight with me. 
Listen, taking out a bunch of Russian spooks is one thing, moving on an ex-president, that's quite another. 
That's a seriously line you're crossing there, pal. 
I know exactly what I'm doing. 
Are you gonna give me the location or not? 
Logan's in a vehicle. 
He's moving west from the U.N. 
Secret Service deployment grid. 
I'll upload his route to your tablet. 
Hold on. 
Okay, I've got it. 
Listen, Jack, I sure hope you know what you're doing, because this path you're on, there ain't no coming back from it. 
I wasn't planning on coming back. 
Look, you're right, you've already done more than I had a rit to ask for. 
I want you to start erasing all your connections to me. 
Jim... 
thanks for everything. 
Good-bye. 
Oh. Thank you. 
Are you sure that's all you need? Should I call the doctor? 
It's just a headache. 
I'm fine. Thank you. 
You wanted to see me, Madame President? Yes, Tim. 
Please sit down. 
You remember the reporter CTU arrested last night? 
Yes, uh, Meredith Reed. 
It has been brought to my attention that she intends to publish an unfounded story regarding Omar Hassan's murder. 
What is she gonna be writing? 
I need you to contact the FBI, have them search the Sunday Magazine offices, locate Reed, and seize whatever evidence she purports to have. 
Um, I-I... I don't understand. 
Her allegations are false, but the allegations alone could derail the peace process. 
Well, even so, Madam President, you have to be aware, they'll accuse you of censoring the press. 
Tim, I did not ask for your counsel. 
I know exactly what I'm ordering you to do, so please just do it. 
Yes, ma'am. 
(grunts) Hey, drop-off and receiving? 
Uh, yeah, straight ahead. 
Right there. 
Thanks. 
Just make sure Duggan knows he's covering the Logan profile. 
Tell him we'll work out the byline later. 
(phone rings) Editor's desk. 
This is Klausner. 
REED: Gary, it's me. 
Look, a-are you alone? 
Can you speak freely? 
Yeah. 
Yeah, wh-what's going on? 
I don't have a lot of time; I have a lead on a story. 
I'm listening. I have a 
digital video recording indicating that the IRK terrorists who killed Hassan were being funded and run by Russian operatives. 
(scoffs) Uh, y-you sure it's legit? 
Where did you get it? 
From Jack Bauer. 
Bauer?! 
The man's a fugitive. 
Look, Gary, it's really not safe for me to talk. 
I'll explain more when I see you. 
Can you meet me? 
Sure, of course. 
All right, that diner with the coffee you hate. 
I can be there in, uh, 15 minutes. 
Okay. And, Gary, 
don't tell anyone. 
All right? 
I got it. 
Meredith... be safe. 
Yeah. You, too. 
There's no need to panic. 
NOVAKOVICH: Do you know what he did to Pavel? 
He was beaten savagely, gutted like a pig. 
His men shot dead. 
I'm... I'm sorry to hear that, 
but we both knew that, uh... 
Bauer would be a difficult problem to solve. 
You know what he's doing, don't you? 
He's eliminating everyone involved, working his way up how long before he gets to me? 
That's not going to happen. 
How can you be so sure Because you told me yourself your man would never talk, and if that's true, then... 
nobody outside of your inner circle can point the finger at you. 
I promise you... 
Bauer's never going to know. 
And on the upside, his recent activities have given us a bit of an advantage. 
What advantage? 
CTU orders concerning him have been upgraded to "shoot on sight." 
First you have to find him. 
They're going to find him; don't worry. 
He can't... he can't stay 
under the radar forever. 
I'll keep you posted. 
(tires screeching) (horns honking) (gunfire) DRIVER: Come in! Come in! 
We're under assault! 
We are trapped in the 4th Street underpass. 
DRIV: Unit LEZ-1, requesting immediate backup. 
Both entrances are blocked. 
We are boxed in. 
Oh, that's... that's Jack Bauer. 
That's got to be. 
Did you hear what I said?! 
That's Jack Bauer! 
DRIVER: I repeat: we need immediate assistance. 
Don't just sit there! 
He's coming for me! 
Sir, stay in the vehicle. 
We're armored and the glass is bulletproof. 
(gunfire) LOGAN: Close the door! 
DRIVER: We are being attacked by automatic gunfire. 
The assailant is masked. 
It may be Jack Bauer. 
Close the door! Secure the 
vehicle! Close the door! 
(grunts) Kill him! 
(Logan gasps) (gas hissing) (coughing) (continues coughing) (coughing, hacking) (gagging) JACK: Mr. President, get up, 
or I will kill you right here. 
Move! 
(gunshot) Move! 
I just got your flash. 
What'd you find out about Ricker? 
You were right. 
DMV records show Ricker living in Suffolk County under the name Simon Strocker. 
I tried to confirm, found out he moved from there 18 months ago, but he left a forwarding address with the postal service it's right here in SoHo. 
Hey, Devon, what's going on? 
Pillar's people are requesting backup for the team in the field. 
Why? 
You didn't hear? 
Jack Bauer just kidnapped Charles Logan. 
How the hell did he pull that off? 
Charles Logan? 
I need to hear what's going on in that room. Follow me. 
How far out are you? 
We're approaching the tunnel now. 
How the hell did Secret Service let this happen? 
Bauer hit the town car with tear gas. 
The agents were too incapacitated to pursue. 
PD's got the tunnel locked down. 
I'm working on getting you schematics. 
Hurry up. 
(tires squealing) CTU! Make a hole! 
(man coughing) Where did Bauer take President Logan? 
I don't know. 
(coughing continues) You must have seen something. 
(coughing) me on- tell me you saw something. 
Sorry, sir. 
Nothing? 
No one saw anything. 
Eden, they went through an underground service gate. 
I need those schematics. 
Sending them to you now. 
Go. 
All right, Kirsch, take the corridor. 
Brown, you're down there. 
Ames, you're with me. 
Remember, unless it poses an immediate threat to President Logan, you shoot Bauer on sight, and you shoot to kill. 
Let's go. 
(Logan panting) Through here. 
(grunts) Look at me. 
I said look at me! 
(whimpers) You're going to tell me everything I want to know. 
Jack, you're making a mistake. 
Don't you even try and pretend you're not a part of this. 
I found the man who killed Renee Walker: the Russian operative Pavel Tokarev. 
I got his cell phone. 
The last call he got was from you. 
I know how it looks. 
You got to let me explain. Explain what? 
That you sent for him to kill me? 
You sent him to kill me, right? 
Yes! Damn it, yes! 
Why did you take out a hit on Renee Walker? 
I had nothing to do with that. 
I was brought in after that happened. 
Who brought you in? 
President Taylor needed my help to bring the Russians back to the table. 
I- I called my sources in Moscow. 
They told me that people in their government were behind Hassan's assassination. 
I- I told the Russian delegation I had evidence of that fact and the names of everybody involved. 
It was just to keep them at the conference. 
What evidence? 
What evidence?! 
It doesn't exist. 
I was playing poker. 
It was a bluff. It worked. 
It kept Taylor's peace agreement on the table, but you... 
You were determined to screw things up. 
And to... Oh! Oh! 
Ow! Easy. Jack! 
Jack! Jack! I admit. 
I admit, I was part of the cover-up, but I'm not part of the Russian conspiracy. 
I had nothing to do with the terrorist attack or your friend's death. 
I- I... I'm... I'm not 
the bad guy here. 
Okay, but you know who is. 
You know the name of the person inside the Russian government who's giving the orders. 
I want that name. 
Jack... 
Give me the name! 
Jack... You got five 
seconds before I put a bullet through your head. No! No! 
You don't have to do that. 
Five... 
I'll tell you. 
four... three... 
Mikhail Novakovich. 
He's the head of the Russian delegation. 
He's been trying to kill the peace treaty from the start. 
(panting) You're lying. 
No! No! No! I'm not lying 
to you! No! No! No! No! 
You got my call from Pavel's phone. 
You check the previous calls. 
There's a dozen more from Novakovich. 
I'm telling you. 
He's the one you want. 
(door thuds open) Shut up! 
(muffled groan) Say another word, and I'll drop you right here. 
(Logan gasping anxiously) Get on your knees. 
Oh, no. Please. 
Don't shoot me, Jack. 
If I was gonna kill you, you'd already be dead. 
(choking) (gags) PILLAR: Bauer was just here- find him! 
Mr. President? 
Are you okay? 
Can you hear me? 
Eden, I need a med unit at the 49th junction. 
On its way. 
Is it Bauer? 
PILLAR: No. It's the president. 
He's unconscious. 
Bauer escaped. I'm gonna need 
you to redirect the pursuit. 
I'll stay with the president. 
Understood. 
They still might catch up to him. 
They haven't yet. 
Do you have Ricker's file? 
Yeah, including his current address. 
I'm sending it to you now. 
How are you planning to handle this? 
We can't send any tactical units to pick this guy up without Pillar finding out about it. 
I'm not using any of them. 
Then who are you going to get? 
All of our agents are fully deployed in the field. 
There's nobody to send. 
There's one. 
(sighs) Ms. O'Brian? 
Ms. O'Brian?! 
I just saw the flash from division. 
They approved your request to release Agent Ortiz into your custody? 
Yeah, I'm in a hurry, so... 
What do you think you're doing? 
He's a non-cooperative witness who is facing federal charges. 
In case you haven't noticed, I'm still in charge of UN Security, and you've taken away all my resources. 
And not that it's any of your business, but Agent Ortiz designed the entire UN operation. 
The signing is in less than two hours. 
His assistance in the field is vital. 
I'm going to have to clear this with Pillar. 
Do what you want, but to me, you have bigger problems, like not finding Jack Bauer. 
(sighs) (sighs) Are you Meredith? 
Yes. 
There's a Gary Klausner on the phone for you. 
It's up by the cashier. 
Thank you. 
Thanks. 
Where are you? 
Meredith, the FBI is here. 
Showed up before I could leave. 
They're looking for you, questioning everyone, including me. 
You didn't tell them anything, did you? 
Of course not. 
But they've got an executive order from the president. 
They say you're in possession of materials that pose a national security risk. 
It's a cover-up, Gary. 
The White House is trying to suppress the story. 
You can't let them. 
Look, until we clear this up, you have to protect that evidence. 
I told them I haven't had any contact with you, but for all I know, they're tracing this call. 
You better get the hell out of there. 
And go where? 
Mr. Klausner. 
We said no communication outside of our presence. 
I- I I'm canceling an appointment. 
Gary, they're going to bury the truth. 
Not if I can help it. 
I'll-try to put a call in to Ed Sampson at the Justice Department, but until then, lay low. 
Now go. 
Okay. 
Let's go. 
Where are we going? 
I have to go to the U.N., and 
division has given you a temporary furlough into my custody. 
Since you had earlier command of UN security, I'm gonna need your help coordinating protocols and deployment for the signing ceremony. 
And Pillar's okay with this? 
I'm still provisional Director of Operations. 
I don't need his consent. 
So, are you coming, or would you rather wait here for your federal prosecution? 
(scoffs) Let's go. 
I'll take him from here. 
You want to tell me what's really going on? 
Yeah. 
You were right about Jack. 
He is working with somebody. 
It's James Ricker, ex-CIA Op. 
We found him living at a place on Mercer Street under the alias Simon Strocker. 
Maybe he's still with the company. 
No. I checked with Langley. 
He was listed as deceased. 
More than likely, he's gone into business for himself, dealing arms or intel. 
In any case, he's not going to be happy we tracked him down. 
Wait a second. 
Why are you telling me this? 
I need you to talk to him. 
Get him to tell us where Jack is. 
Are you good with that, or have you still not taken sides? 
I want to expose this cover-up as much as you. I'm in. 
Good. Log sheets 
will show you accompanying me to the UN. 
I've secured you a separate vehicle waiting at the gate. 
Is there any more intel on Jack? 
Has he resurfaced again? 
Yeah, you could say that. 
Sir, I just received word. 
President Suvarov's plane has touched down at Kennedy Airport. 
Tell Ivan to bring the car around. 
I want to be at the UN when the president arrives. 
(phone ringing) Where's Novakovich? 
I'm not going to ask you again. 11th. 
11th floor, suite 1170. 
How do I get up there? 
Secure elevator inside of garage. 
Where's your keycard? 
I don't have one. 
(grunting) Where is your keycard? 
I don't have one, I swear. 
His personal guards have them at elevator. 
How many? 
Two. 
And upstairs? 
One outside the suite, two inside. 
Another by elevator. 
Where else? 
Where else?! 
That's all. 
That's all I know. 
(grunting) (bell chimes) (grunting) (blade slashing) (bell dings) (groans quietly) Do you really need an arsenal? 
Better to have it than to not. 
Besides, Ricker's a trained killer. 
He's gone to a lot of trouble to stay off the grid. 
Fair enough. 
I also have to consider the possibility that Jack's with him. 
Listen, Chloe, I can't be worried about Jack anymore, not after what you told me he did to Logan. 
Obviously, Logan's part of the conspiracy. 
He terrorized a tunnel full of commuters with automatic weapon fire. 
He shot Seet Service agents. 
He shot to wound. 
He's careless, and he only cares about revenge. 
Does that sound like the man you know? 
Like the man you're trying to save? 
This is about exposing the Russians' cover-up. 
It's not about Jack. 
Are you sure about that? 
Because if Jack's there, and he makes any move other than complete surrender... 
...I'm putting him down. 
You still want me to go? 
I don't really have a choice. 
Whatever happens, call me at the U.N. 
You got it. 
(engine starts) You'll approach the rostrum immediately prior to the signing ceremony, and take a seat here in position three, next to your mother. 
I'm honored. 
But is that appropriate? 
I may be her daughter, but I don't have any official role in government. 
(knocking on door) Excuse me. 
Ms. Hassan, there's a call 
on your father's secure line a woman demanding to speak with your mother. 
She's in a meeting. 
That's what I said, but this woman is quite insistent. 
Who is she? 
She won't say. 
We're done, Ms. Hassan. 
I'll see you in the staging area. 
Thank you. 
Line two. 
Thank you. 
Hello. Who is this? 
Ah. Is this Kayla? 
Who are you? 
Sorry, um... 
my name is Meredith Reed. 
I need to speak to your mother. 
I know who you are. 
What do you think you're doing calling here? 
I- I know I'm the last person that either of you wants to talk to right now... 
You're right. 
I'm hanging up now. 
No, please, please, your mother needs to hear what I have to say before she signs the agreement with President Taylor. 
What is it that is so important? 
I- I'm sorry, I need to speak to your mother directly. 
Haven't you caused my mother enough pain? 
Leave us alone! 
It's about the people who really murdered your father. 
What are you talking about? 
We know who was responsible. 
What you don't know is, those people were working under the orders of Russian agents. 
What?! 
Hello? 
When your mother gets back from her meetings, have her call me at this number- can you take this down? 
(panting) Go ahead. 
It's 212-555-0121. 
I'll explain everything to her then. 
Wait...! 
Meredith Reed? 
FBI. Get your hands where 
we can see 'em. Wait, 
wait, what-what is this? 
What is this? 
Wait. Wait. 
You have no right to take that. 
I- I haven't done anything wrong. 
What is this? 
You're under arrest. 
I  I've done nothing wrong. Let's go. 
I've done nothing wrong! 
(knocking on door) Yes? 
Mr. Woods, ma'am. 
I've just received word from the FBI. 
Reed is in custody, and they've secured a data card they found on her. 
(sighs) No one sees what's on it but me. 
Understood. 
MAN: Sir, we'll take it from here. 
No, you won't  I'm riding with him to the hospital. 
(clears throat) Give him some space. 
(weakly): Nova... Novakov... 
Nova... 
Novakovich. 
Warn... 
Bauer knows. 
Warn Novakovich Bauer's coming after him. 
PARAMEDIC: Sir, we gotta get going. Not yet. Just do 
what you can for him here. 
Understood. 
(phone ringing) (ringing continues) (ringing continues) (ringing continues) Yes? 
Mr. Novakovich? 
Hello? Hello? 
It's Berkov. 
We've been attacked. 
It was Bauer. 
Where's Novakovich? 
He's dead. 
Everyone is dead. 
Berkov, did Novakovich say anything to Bauer? 
I need an ambulance. 
Just answer my question. 
What did Novakovich say to Bauer? 
Nothing. Bauer 
just came in shooting. 
But he was bleeding. 
I think he was wounded by one of the guards. 
All right, sit tight; an ambulance is on the way. 
Go. 
(quietly): Novakovich is dead. 
Bauer killed him, killed all of his men... 
(continues indistinctly) (phone ringing) Yes? 
LOGAN (clears throat): Yuri. 
Charles Logan. 
I was under the impression you were going to be at the heliport for my arrival. 
Yes, well... 
(raspy chuckle) ...I ran into some trouble. 
I'm afraid I have bad news. 
It appears that Mikhail Novakovich was just murdered by Jack Bauer. 
What?! Yeah, and, 
uh, Bauer learned that, uh, Novakovich was responsible for ordering and... 
coordinating Omar Hassan's assassination, as well as the rest of Samir's activities. 
Where would he get that idea? 
From me. 
The lunatic was gonna kill me, Yuri. 
What can I say? 
Think of it as, uh, sacrificing a rook for a king. 
Then Bauer has no idea that Novakovich was operating under my orders? 
None. 
Uh, according to a witness, Mikhail didn't have a chance to give you up, even he wanted to. 
As far as, uh, Bauer is concerned... 
the trail ended with Novakovich. 
And he's being hunted by every law enforcement agency in the city. 
And I've-I've heard that, uh... (chuckles) 
he's been wounded. 
unded- there is nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal. 
Look, if you're so worried about Bauer, you never should have given the order to kill Renee Walker. 
That's what stirred up the hornet's nest. 
If I had known that yowere going to find out about our activities and use that information to blackmail me into signing Taylor's peace agreement, I wouldn't have bothered with the woman. 
Water under the bridge, Yuri. 
I needed an opportunity to put myself back in the game. 
I'm sorry that it has come at your expense. 
You wouldn't begrudge an old friend his second chance in the sun. 
LOGAN (over radio): All right, then, I will, uh, I will meet you at the United Nations... 
(clears throat) as soon as I can. 
I need to know about my brother. 
He's alive. Get out now. 
It can't be long before they realize it's you. 
I need you to get back in the car. 
Ah! 
Your brother was involved with the attack. 
He's the insider we've been looking for. 
What's going on? 
The body triggered a Hazmat alarm. 
It's highly enriched uranium. 
You mean it's weapons-grade? 
How the hell did he come into contact with that? 
I think I know the answer. 
Someone approached my brother with weapons-grade uranium. 
 Who?   Someone who had access 
to decommissioned Soviet stockpile. 
You must find the Russians before they can get the uranium to my brother. 
I want proof that the rods exist, or you will not be paid. 
You want proof, huh? 
Come with me. 
My younger son, he was transporting the rods, and he was careless. 
There, you have your proof. 
You were undercover for nearly two years with the Russian mob. 
Your cover is still intact. 
Are you asking me to go back in? 
Agent Walker hasn't been undercover for over six year I think you're making a mistake by putting her in. 
You must have other options. 
She's our only way in. 
Fine, then I want to go with her. 
I assume your plan is trying to set up a competing buy? 
I'll act as a buyer. 
I'm looking for Vladimir. 
Vlad disappeared. 
But you can find him. 
They know where I am 24/7. 
I'm still in prison. 
Parole bracelet? 
I can get this off. 
You can't cut bracelet. 
I'm not gonna cut the bracelet. 
What the hell have you done?! 
That's it, this is over. 
Maybe for you, Jack, but I'm just getting started. 
Where have you been? 
It took me this long to get clear. 
I'm with Bazhaev. 
To hell with Bazhaev! 
Everything we have worked for, it's all over because of him. 
It's not over, General. 
Of course it is! 
Your brother is still alive, and your plan to replace him as head of state is finished. 
Now his security forces are rounding up our people all over the city. 
General Amiri was just pulled from his home five minutes ago, in front of his wife and children. 
Look, the Americans won't let him continue. 
They'll accuse him of human rights violations and threaten to pull out of the peace talks. 
Once we have the uranium my brother will become irrelevant anyway. 
You are being hunted like an animal. 
How do you expect to get the uranium? 
Bazhaev can deliver it to us, but first I need payment wired to his account. 
It's all right. 
Mm. Thank you. 
I found a doctor who can treat him. 
We have been through this. 
No doctors. 
Yes, but this one has a family. 
I know where they are, I know their names. 
I'll make sure he keeps his mouth shut. 
And you can guarantee no one else in this clinic will find out? 
Another doctor, a nurse, no one? 
The authorities know about the nuclear material or they will soon enough, and they'll be looking everywhere. 
Putting Oleg in a clinic would lead them right to us. 
He's going to die if we don't get him help. 
Then he's going to die. 
But alone like this? 
In a cold room behind the kitchen? 
He's my brother, Papa, and he's your son. 
All right. 
Take him to the country house. 
Ulana will look after him. 
Thank you, Papa. 
What is it? 
Farhad is asking for you. 
You have news for me? 
Yes. 
The money will be transferred to your account shortly. 
When can I take possession of the rods? 
As soon as we have the money. 
Five hours. 
Good. 
I'll help you pass the time. 
You have a preference? 
No. 
Then take both. 
He's still bleeding out. 
This should cauterize the wound. 
Okay, it's working. 
Who are you calling? 
 Hastings.   Why? 
Because I'm shutting this operation down. 
You shouldn't be in the field, and this proves it. 
This was the only play, Jack. 
You would've done the same thing. 
The play was to get him to cooperate. 
 He will cooperate.   How do you figure? 
Look, I know these guys, Jack. 
The only thing that Ziya likes more than 13-year-old girls is money. 
He'd have butchered himself for a score like this. 
Yeah, well, Hastings still needs to know the truth. 
The truth? 
That you're unstable! 
Look... I don't blame you 
after everything you've been through, but you are not fit for this mission. 
I went through a rough patch, yeah, but I came out on the other side. 
And I don't think you have. 
The bottom line is, I'm still the best chance that anyone has of intercepting that uranium, and I can do it now. 
So, what's it going to be, you making that phone call or what? 
He's waking up, Jack. 
Better make up your mind. 
Fine. 
You see what you can get out of him. 
But don't forget, I'm listening. 
Renee! 
Shut up, Ziya. 
Renee! 
You'll get your painkillers as soon as we get out of here. 
 What did you do?!   I got the bracelet off, 
all right, I did you a favor. 
You crazy bitch! You cut off thumb! 
Look, what's done is done. 
You can either stay here and whine about it like a baby, or you can come with me and be a rich man. 
Look, I'm willing to give you a point on this deal off the top. 
It's a lot of money, Ziya. 
How much? 
Two-and-a-half million. 
Maybe three when it's all done. 
Two million? 
You're serious? 
You tell me. 
I take this deal to Vladimir, and it's not real, you know what happens?! 
Why would I be here if this wasn't real?! 
Fine, forget it, Ziya. 
I'll find Vladimir my own way. 
No, wait! 
I don't know where he is exactly, but where he might be. 
Tell me. 
No, I'll take you there myself. 
You have a car? 
I have truck, it's parked out back. 
All right, I'll drive. 
Come on! 
Yeah? 
Jack, I just found out in my background check that Ziya has a probation officer. 
 How do you want to handle this?   You don't need to. 
He has a tracking bracelet. 
Not anymore. 
I don't understand. 
Those things have anti-tamper mechanisms. 
You can't cut them off him without triggering an alarm. 
Yeah, well, trust me, it's been taken care of. 
Jack, what happened in there? 
Renee got the result she wanted. 
Ziya's taking her to Vladimir. 
Dana's still working on your cover profile. 
Okay, they're moving. 
I'll call you when it's ready. 
Jack's still waiting on the rest of that profile. 
I'm still working the timeline. 
Tell him I'm almost finished. 
Okay. 
Aren't you going to get that? 
Yeah, probably should. 
Hello? 
I'm in the middle of something. 
Hold on a second. 
Chloe, I will send that profile to you as soon as I'm done. 
Okay. 
I told you not to call. 
Yeah, I know what you told me. 
But now that I'm here in your apartment, I just can't help but miss you. 
My shift is over in the morning. 
I will see you then. 
Yeah, well, that's just not going to work now, is it? 
I'm right in the middle of something, Kevin. 
Turn on the news if you don't believe me. 
Hey, that's not my problem. 
Okay, I need to see you. 
 You have 15 minutes.   That's not possible. 
Okay, you got 30. 
Who said I can't be reasonable? 
Kevin... 
Don't make me call that little boyfriend of yours. 
Rock his perfect little world. 
"Hey, pal, congratulations on the engagement." 
"By the way, her name's not Dana Walsh, it's Jenny Scott." 
"Oh, did I mention that she's an ex-con?" 
"No, no, no, nothing too serious." 
"Just accessory to murder is all." 
You still there? 
Yeah, I'm here. 
See you soon. 
Arlo, can I ask you something? 
Yes, I'm available Saturday night, and I can change my plans for Friday if you want. 
Also, I'm free on Thursday. 
Look, Arlo, I'm sorry. 
It's just, a situation's come up, and I have to go home for a while. 
Dana, we're in the middle of a major protocol. 
I understand that, and I won't be long, I promise. 
But I need you to cover for me. 
Put the finishing touches on the profile for Renee Walker and Jack Bauer. 
And if I ask what this is about, you'll tell me... 
 That it's none of your business.   Right. 
I thought so. 
Send it to Chloe's screen as soon as you're finished. 
Okay. 
Thank you, Arlo. I owe you one. 
One what? 
Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. 
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. 
I've spoken to 12 heads of state. 
They're concerned, but they're all still planning to attend the signing ceremony tomorrow. 
Well, I've got some bad news. 
Apparently, killing President Hassan was only part of his brother's plan. 
CTU now believes he's also trying to acquire weapons-grade uranium. 
From whom? 
A Russian crime syndicate here in New York. 
Half of them are ex-Soviet Army or KGB. 
If anyone had access to unsecured stockpiles... 
It's what we've been afraid of since the Wall came down. 
Is President Hassan aware of this? 
He's the one who told CTU about it. 
Director Hastings has already initiated an undercover operation to try to recover the uranium before it's smuggled out of the country. 
The nuclear materials are here on U.S. soil? 
 Are they sure?   Afraid so. 
Ethan, you asked if President Hassan was aware of this. Why? 
Helps explain what's been going on in the Islamic Republic. 
I just spoke with our ambassador in the I.R.K. 
Hassan's security forces are sweeping through the capital, arresting opposition leaders, shuttering news organizations. 
Has he declared martial law? 
Not officially, but effectively, that's exactly what he's been doing. 
Who can blame him? 
I mean, his brother can't have been acting alone. 
We want Hassan cracking down on hardliners in his own government. 
Except that he's defying his country's laws, as well as his international human rights obligations. 
And if he continues, it may delegitimize the peace accord. 
Is President Hassan back yet from CTU? 
He'll be here in ten minutes. 
I want to speak to him... alone. 
I'll take care of it. 
That's enough. 
What's your problem? 
I need you thinking clearly. 
You tell me you'd get me real painkiller. 
Put it away. 
I'm surprised. 
I'm surprised you take deal to him again after what he did to you. 
How much further? 
Okay. 
You don't want to talk about Vladimir. 
I understand. 
I don't blame you. 
After all, what is there to say about such a man? 
Nothing good, nothing very... 
Just tell me how much further. 
Ten minute. 
Touchy, touchy. 
Yeah? 
Arlo just locked your cover profile. 
I'm uplinking it to you now. 
Okay, hold on one sec. 
Okay, I got it. 
Hey, you're taking me out of Renee's comm when you call, right? 
Yes. 
Okay, I want you to go into her undercover file with regards to Vladimir Laitanan. 
I need to know everything that happened between them. 
I'll call you right back. 
Okay, thanks. 
Mr. President. 
Your chief of staff said it was urgent. 
It is, but first, I want to say again how thankful we are that you're all right. 
If this is about my security forces and the necessary steps I'm taking back home, I'm afraid I can't help you. 
Are you so sure they're necessary? 
What happened today was nothing short of a coup. 
These same people are trying to restart my country's nuclear weapons' program. 
I understand, but... 
No, I don't think you do. 
Yours is an open society, Madam President, governed by the rule of law. 
Mine is closed. 
The only real law is power. 
Any perceived weakness on my part, and I'm finished. 
I'm aware of the complexities of your situation, Mr. President. 
My brother tried to kill me, helped by elements within my own government. 
Those elements must now be purged. 
Purged? 
You mean, executed? 
It is the only thing my people understand. 
I can't vouch for you as a reformer, Mr. President, 
if you renege on your human rights obligations. 
The world is trusting you because I trust you. 
You're asking me to show mercy to enemies who are trying to destroy me. 
I am asking you to find a middle way, in the name of bringing peace to a region that hasn't known peace for generations. 
I need to see my family now. 
I found a doctor. 
A doctor?  
Someone who can help you, someone we can control, but Papa says it's too risky. 
Papa's right. 
Condemning you to death? 
I don't believe that. 
What happened... was my own fault. 
The family shouldn't have to pay for my mistake. 
You know, all these years, I thought it was an act. 
But you really are the good son, aren't you? 
I'm no better or worse than you, Josef. 
You're my older brother. 
You've always looked out for me. 
Joseph? Joseph, what are you doing?! 
I'm taking you to the doctor. 
But Papa said we can't. 
I don't care what Papa said! 
I'm not letting you die without a fight. 
You are old enough to make your own decisions. 
I've decided to stay. 
As you wish. 
You should stay, too. 
I can't. 
Why not? You think that 
your father is one way, but he's not what you think. 
Stop doing that. 
 You always do that.   What? 
Imply things, but you never actually tell me what you mean. 
It is better that way, Kayla, believe me. 
I don't want to poison you against your father.  
There. You're doing it again. 
You can't help yourself. 
Doing what again? 
Father! 
Oh, are you all right? 
I'm fine. 
We thought that... 
I know, I know. 
Kayla, I need to speak to your mother now alone. 
Okay. 
Dalia? 
We have nothing to say to each other. 
Dalia, please. 
Do you love her? 
It's over. 
I ended it. 
You didn't answer the question. 
Be honest for once. 
Show me a little respect. 
I'm your wife, damn it. 
Do you love her? 
Maybe I thought I did. 
Then say it. 
What does it matter now? 
It matters to me. 
The truth is... 
I'm just glad I could still feel something, anything. 
And that's my fault somehow? How dare you! 
Our fault. 
There's enough blame to go around. 
Dalia, please don't go. 
What? 
I don't want you to leave. 
Don't worry. 
I won't make a scene. 
You should know me better than that by now. 
My brother's a traitor. 
My highest officers are conspiring against me. 
And now President Taylor is threatening to pull out of the peace talks. 
It has been a long time since you've asked my advice about anything. 
You were the one who always gave me the best counsel. 
Thank you for remembering that. 
Then you'll stay? 
It's too late for that, Omar. 
Too much has happened between us. 
Dalia... 
I'm sorry. 
Vlad operates out of here? 
Sometimes. 
He moved around a lot. 
That's why cops don't find him inside here. 
Come on, let's go. 
Hey, Ziya? 
Hmm? 
You know, Vladimir was never fond of surprises, so I was thinking... 
maybe you could go in first? 
Get him used to the idea of me again. 
Whet his appetite? 
Exactly. 
Okay. 
Is our cover in place? 
Yeah. Chloe got me everything. 
Good. Let's start going over what happened in Mexico City. 
How we met, who we dealt with. 
First tell me about Vladimir. 
What do you want to know? 
What he did to you? I heard what Ziya said. 
Ziya? 
Come on, Jack, he's a drama queen. 
Damn it, Renee, I am running this! 
Stop messing with me! 
I'm responsible for your safety. 
So, when I ask you a straight question, you give me a straight answer. 
Look, it was nothing, all right? 
I handled him six years ago, I can handle him today. 
The only thing that I am worried about is locking down this cover, so, please, let's not waste another minute on Vladimir. 
I'm a Munich-based arms dealer named Ernst Meier. 
We met in Mexico City. 
You became my liaison to the locals. 
Lugo. 
Long time. 
It's me, Ziya. 
I know who you are. 
Now what the hell are you doing here? 
I've got business. 
 Business?   Yeah. 
With Vladimir. 
You've got business with me? 
Vlad! 
I should kill you for even thinking of coming here. 
What? 
Let me go, please! 
 No, I...   Five years 
I've been living underground. 
Five years! And now you walk into my place of business? 
You're on probation! 
No. Not anymore, Vlad. 
Look. 
She get bracelet off. 
What are you talking about? Who did? 
It's what I'm trying to tell you. Renee. 
Renee Zadan. 
She come to my place looking for you. 
Yeah, she say she have buyer that you'd want to hear about. 
That it'd be good for all of us. 
It'd be worth it for all of us. 
Renee. 
Dah. 
She say where she'd been these last five years? 
Uh, where everybody else was. 
In jail. 
Then she go to Mexico City. 
She say she got the opportunity there. 
Mexico City, huh? 
What do you think, Lugo? 
You believe this piece of dirt? 
Sure I believe him. 
He's too stupid to make up a story like that. 
It's her I don't believe. 
I never did. 
I told you, Lugo, it wasn't her. 
She's not the one who sold us out. 
She shows up out of the blue, then 16 months later, the feds are down our throats. 
I'm just saying, Vlad. 
You were just saying. 
Where's Renee now? 
Outside. 
Clean yourself up. 
Bring her to me. 
Arlo, where's Dana? 
She isn't at her desk. She went home. 
Home? 
Yeah. 
Who is it? 
It's me. 
You have my key. 
Nice of you to drop by. 
It's not funny. 
What the hell?! Who's he? 
That's Nick. 
It's a buddy of mine from Beaumont. 
Get him the hell out of here. 
You know I can't do that, Jen. 
I already told him he could stay. 
It'd be impolite. 
Here. 
What's this? 
It's $500. 
It's all I could get out of the cash machine. 
I'll get you another 500 in the morning. 
You think you're smart, and the whole world's stupid. 
That's just not how it is, Jen. 
I don't think you're stupid. 
No? But you think you can buy me off with $1,000? 
I'm not trying to buy you off. 
No, no. 
What do you want from me? 
You know what I want? 
What I really want is for you to stop treating me like some dumbass, 19-year-old stickup artist with a fast car! 
You're not the only one who's grown up. 
Easy, Kevin, easy. 
I've been waiting for this moment. 
Dreaming about it. 
You owe me. 
If you think that I testified against you, I didn't. 
Don't lie to me! 
I'm not lying to you! 
I got out of jail before you did, yeah, but only because I went in as a minor. 
No other reason. 
The truth is, it doesn't change things, one way or another. 
See, I've done my homework. 
I know what your job is. 
I'm a data analyst, nothing more. 
Yeah, but you're a data analyst for CTU. 
You got access to all sorts of good stuff... 
bank codes, port authority manifests, stock exchange. 
Access, yeah, but not unrestricted access. 
You'll figure something out. 
You always do. 
But whatever it is, the payout's got to be at least six figures, okay? 
Please, Kevin. 
Okay, here's the deal. 
You do this one thing for me, and I'm gone. 
I'll never bother you again. 
I can't. 
You can. 
And you will. 
Since last August, we've been living and operating out of a hotel called Bella Nocheon Avenida Juarez. 
Can't they check that? 
Yeah, it's been set up as a safe haven for high-end criminal activity. 
They don't keep records. Have you got the name? 
Bella Noche. I got it. 
Okay, I'm going to be monitoring you, filling in the details. 
Just listen to my voice. 
I'll get you all the information you need. 
He's coming. 
Come on. Let's go. 
Yeah? 
It's not pretty, Jack. 
She had a real problem on her hands. 
Talk to me. 
According to the responsible agent, Vladimir Laitanan was completely obsessed with her. 
It turned violent. 
How violent? 
Broken ribs, a busted cheekbone. 
A couple of trips to the emergency room. 
Did he rape her? 
Not according to these files, but it looks like he tried a couple of times. 
Did she say anything about this to you or Hastings? 
No. 
What's this about, Jack? 
Jack? 
The FBI tried to cover this up as much as they could. 
But after she left the bureau, Renee went into a tailspin. 
She tried to kill herself at least once that I know about. 
She says she's past it, but I know she's not. 
I can see it in her eyes. 
You think she's purposely putting herself in harm's way? 
I don't think she cares what happens to her either way. 
 Where is she now?   She's going in. 
I'm going to put you on speaker. 
(speaking native language) Hands up. 
Turn around. 
Go. 
Hello, Vlad. 
Renee. 
You changed your face. 
I had it done in Caracas. 
What do you think? 
Makes you look younger. 
I should get the name of that doctor. 
He's not practicing anymore. 
A sad story. 
Our little friend here says you were in Mexico City. 
For what? 
Had some business. 
Good for you. I have some contacts there myself. 
Yeah, I know you do. 
So... 
give me names. 
The Peralta-Rodriguez... 
 family.   Uh... 
The Peralta-Rodriguez family. 
Castorenas in Guadalajara. 
Ramon Jimenez. 
I know Ramon. Is his brother Luiz still running 
their heroin operations? 
He was killed nine months ago by the Federales. 
Not since he was killed by the Federales nine months ago. 
You know, Renee, now that you mention it, there is something different about you, too. 
How do you mean? 
Your eyes. 
Your skin. 
You look like hell. 
Well, it's hard to look your best with a gun in your face. 
No, that's not it. 
Something else. 
Have you been sick? 
No. 
Maybe you picked up a little Hepatitis C on your travels? 
Where were you staying in Mexico City? 
The Bella. 
Bella Noche Hotel. 
Bella Noche, naturally. 
Then, of course, you must know the government official who allows it to operate without police interference. 
Chloe, the hotel in Mexico City... 
was there a local politician on the take? 
 I don't have it here.   Neither do I. 
 Checking DEA database.   Come on. 
 Chloe.   Give me a minute. 
She doesn't have a minute. 
Waiting for a name! 
Go ahead, tell him. 
Really getting tired of this, Vlad. 
His name! 
Got it... Raul Castillo. 
Castillo, Raul Castillo. 
Raul Castillo, all right? 
Are we done playing 20 questions now? 
Yes, I believe we are. 
You know, Renee, I had almost forgotten how much fun you are. 
You're not like other women. 
You have balls. 
Hmm, you always did say the nicest things. 
Can we talk about this deal now? 
I wish it were that simple. 
Tie her up. 
What? 
Vlad, what are you doing? 
You gave me all the right answers, Renee,  but you're not telling the truth.   You're making 
a mistake. 
This is the chance of a lifetime. 
Him, too. 
Vlad, wait. 
Put them in the trunk. 
Vladimir, Vladimir, no! 
No, Vladimir, please don't do this! 
Listen to me! 
She come to me! 
She come to my place, the bitch! 
I swear! 
Vladimir, I don't know anything about this! 
No! 
Chloe, what the hell just happened? 
They put her in the trunk, I lost audio. 
Boosting the signal now. 
Renee? 
Try it again. 
Renee, can you hear me? 
Say something. 
Chloe, I don't have her. 
Then the car must be armored. 
Either that or her comm shorted out. 
Are you seeing this? 
I am. 
Okay, I'm following north through an alley towards Woodward. 
I think this operation just blew up. 
Jack, are you planning to intercept? 
Not if the car is armored. 
I'm gonna need tactical support. 
I'm alerting Hastings to scramble a team now. 
Tell him I see four men in the car, and we're going to have to assume they're taking Renee somewhere to kill her. 
Copy that. 
Damn it! 
Don't work too late, hon. 
Call me when you're on the road. 
Will do. 
Dr. Levine. 
How did you get in here? 
My brother is sick. 
I'm not seeing patients right now. 
He needs your help. 
 I'm gonna call you an ambulance.   No. 
No one else can know about this. 
My men are outside your house in New Rochelle. 
I don't believe you. 
I just spoke to my wife. 
We're outside the gate. 
The address is 1614 Brook Street. 
The light in your little daughter's room just went out about ten minutes ago, so I want you to put the phone down because you're not going to try to warn anybody about this. 
Do you understand? 
I understand. 
My brother has radiation poisoning. 
He needs treatment. 
His symptoms seem quite advanced. 
I'm not sure what it is I can do for him. 
Well, you'd better be able to do something, for your family's sake. 
I, um... I need to know what kind of materials 
he came in contact with. 
It was uranium. 
Do you know what variant, the isotope? 
Weapons-grade 235. 
Jack, this is Hastings. 
TAC teams are three minutes away. 
All of them aware that Renee is in the trunk? 
The instructions are to engage only on my command. 
Any indication where they're taking her? 
 None.   Any percentage in letting this play out? 
No. As soon as she's out of the vehicle, 
she becomes that much more vulnerable. 
If we engage now, it means ending the operation. 
This operation's over. 
Vladimir didn't take the bait. 
Target just turned south on Flushing. 
Jack, that's a feeder onto the BQE in 2.6 miles. 
Mr. Hastings, if we don't engage on these surface streets, 
we lose our tactical advantage. 
Chloe, get me an ETA. 
Intercept in... two minutes, ten seconds. 
Sir, you need to make the call now. 
All right, I'm authorizing engagement. 
Stand by for intercept protocols. 
This is good. Pull over. 
Open it. 
Take them out of the trunk. 
Lugo, please, you tell him, tell Vladimir... 
Chloe, I've got a signal again. 
Please, Vladimir, Vlad... 
Something's wrong... they definitely sound stopped, 
but the vehicle I'm following is still going south on Flushing. 
 She told me to come to you!   Shut up, shut up, Ziya. 
It's not going to do any good. 
Confirming that, Jack, the target is still moving. 
Chloe, we're following a decoy. 
They must have left in another vehicle. Find it! 
Okay, pulling up a satellite footage. 
All right, TAC teams,  hold your positions, stand by.   Jack, 
another car drove out of the back of the auto parts building five minutes after the first one. 
Are you kidding me?! 
I'm sorry, we were focusing everything on your follow. 
Just tell me where they are! 
Take them down to the water. 
Okay, I've got a GPS lock on Renee. 
They're pulled off at Newtown Creek, just south of Bryne Memorial Bridge. 
 Where are the TAC teams?   I'm redirecting them now. 
How far out are they? 
 At least ten minutes.   Tell them to move it. 
Put me back on to Renee's comm. Damn it! 
Renee, it's Jack. 
I know you can hear me. 
Vladimir had us following a decoy. 
TAC teams are ten minutes out. 
I'm on my way now. 
Do whatever you have to to buy time. 
On your knees, both of you. 
Please listen to me, I don't know anything. 
Shut your mouth. 
I'm going to give you one last chance to tell me what is going on. 
Vladimir, I swear on my life, she come to my place. 
I don't know anything. 
No! 
Renee. 
Renee?! 
Amazing. 
You didn't even blink. 
Go ahead. 
Just get it over with. 
Renee, what the hell are you doing? 
Not yet. 
For God's sake, don't make me grovel. 
Just pull the damn trigger. 
First I want to hear the truth. 
I want to know who you really are. 
Who I really am? 
Yeah, who you are, not a game, Renee... 
or whatever your name is. 
Fine, you want the truth? 
I'll tell you the truth. 
You were right. 
You were right, I am sick. 
I am so sick of living like this. 
The truth is... 
even if you let me walk right now... 
I have nowhere to go and no one to go to. 
You don't want to do this deal, fine. 
Then you might as well just kill me because this deal is the only thing that I have. 
Renee, please don't do this, please. 
Besides, you wouldn't be doing anything that I haven't already tried myself. 
Do it. 
Do it! 
Pull the trigger! 
You understand, right? 
Yes. 
Good... good. 
Dump him in the river. 
I need a status update. 
Jack, are you there? 
Do you copy? 
You tell the TAC teams to stand down. 
What's going on? 
She's in. 
They bought her cover. 
I don't want to see either one of you ever again. 
Do we have a deal or not? 
Yeah, we got a deal. 
I'm going after him. 
We're done. 
We're just getting started. 
Jenny! 
We need to talk about you having Tarin arrested. 
I know you consider Tarin a friend. 
We are more than friends. 
We're in love. 
You've been carrying on with this man... 
behind my back? 
Who are these men, Samir? 
These are men I have recruited. 
We can't get the rods out of the country, so let's use them as a radiological bomb. 
Then we'll show the Americans how strong we are. 
Samir! 
Over here! 
There are people chasing me. 
They have the rods you are looking for. 
I thought you had the rods. 
They turned against me. 
Just get me out of here. 
We'll get you out, Mr. Hassan. 
When things get this colossally screwed up people look for someone to blame. 
So what have you got in mind? 
Renee Walker- she killed one of our main leads. 
You're talking about a woman who put her life on the line when she didn't have to. 
Well, someone has to pay for this, Brian. 
I'm sending someone over from Justice- Kristin Smith. 
She'll take care of everything. 
They're setting you up don't say another word. 
It's too late. 
This is over. 
We're leaving now. 
Hands in the air. 
Do it now! 
You offering to bring in Farhad? Yes. 
If you drop the criminal investigation against Renee Walker. 
If we do this, Jack, it's not for one rescue operation, it's till this whole thing is over and done. 
Deal. 
We're about to transport him to the embassy. 
You have two minutes. 
Thank you. 
Bashir, clear the room. 
Tarin, did they hurt you? 
Not yet. 
They won't until they get me to our embassy. 
I tried to reason with my father, but he wouldn't listen. 
He thinks you're involved in the conspiracy with his brother. 
Even after I told him about us, he doesn't trust you. 
You told him about us? 
I hoped it would change his mind. 
But if anything, it's made things worse between us. 
Come closer. 
Listen to me, Kayla, there is a way out of this. 
There are a few men still loyal to me- Bashir is one of them. 
He's agreed to help me escape. 
As soon as he's able, Bashir will slip me a handcuff key, and he's placed a gun in the car for me to find. 
You won't hurt anyone? 
The gun is so I won't have to. 
Once I'm free, I have a place to stay until the Americans grant me asylum. 
Kayla... I want 
you to come with me. 
Meet me at the Teodore Hotel. 
Promise me you'll come. 
Tarin, we need to go. 
Cole, he's dead! 
Just go. 
What? 
Just go. 
Nobody knows you had anything to do with this. 
It's my fault. 
I lied about everything. 
Who I am, what I've done. 
I'll call the police. 
I deserve to take the blame for this. 
What's done is done. 
We're cleaning this up, and no one's ever gonna know what happened. 
I don't want you involved. 
I'm already involved. 
We're gonna strip down his van so it can't be I.D.'d. 
We'll dump the bodies in the swamp. 
Hey. Hey! 
They're scum, Dana, and no one's gonna miss 'em. 
You want to go to prison for the rest of your life? For them?! 
Get started on the van. 
I'll go get the other one. 
Mr. Hastings, 
the president's on the line. 
Thank you. This is Hastings. 
Mr. Hastings, I'm 
here with Rob Weiss. 
I was told you have urgent news. 
Yes, ma'am. 
We received a call from Farhad Hassan. 
Farhad? 
Yes. As we suspected, 
he was trying to smuggle the nuclear rods out of the country. 
The people he's working with have turned against him. 
What do we know? 
Well, Farhad believes they want to use the rods to construct a dirty bomb and set it off somewhere here in New York City. 
Why would they do this? 
Between Hassan's crackdowns and CTU, we've backed them into a corner. 
This is their response. 
Do you believe him? 
Yes, I do. 
Farhad is turning himself in. 
He's agreed to help us prevent this attack. 
Where is Farhad now? 
He's in a warehouse just outside the city near Forest Hills. 
I've enlisted Jack Bauer to lock him down. 
Now, Madam President, the men who turned against Farhad are covert assets for the I.R.K. 
Now, if we can get access to the I.R.K. 
intelligence files, Farhad may be able to help us I.D. these men. 
It will put us that much closer to tracking them down. Those 
files are the lifeblood of Hassan's intelligence operation he'll never hand them over. 
Especially in his current frame of mind. 
Hell, the man's gone off the deep end. 
Well, maybe this will pull him out of it. 
Tell Hassan we have found his brother and I need to speak to him immediately. 
And contact Tim Woods at Homeland. 
Have him put together a briefing. 
I need to exactly what we're facing if, God forbid, this attack happens. 
Thank you, Mr. Hastings. 
I'll be in the counsel chamber. 
Yes, Madam President. 
Mr. Weiss. 
Yeah? 
Are we alone? 
Yeah. What is it? 
I want to let you know that I've decided not to pursue charges against Renee Walker. 
What? 
Why not? I told you... 
We have a lot more to worry about right now than blaming Walker. 
Walker murdered a valuable lead that might have gotten us to those nuclear rods. 
You're not hearing me. 
We have a new lead now Farhad Hassan and that is what I am pursuing. 
You want to replace me as head of CTU, be my guest. 
But until you do, stay the hell out of my way. 
Hastings, you're making... I'll let you know 
when Bauer reaches Farhad. 
Okay, Farhad Hassan is located on the northeast corner of the warehouse. 
We're gonna have to move fast, because he's injured. 
King, Lynch, you're gonna go in from the south. 
Owen and I will cover your flank. 
Understood. As soon as we've 
got him locked down, we're gonna initiate our interrogation. 
CTU's gonna upload files on probable suspects I need that available and on a computer as soon as possible. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Bauer, we're getting 
a call routed through CTU. 
It's Farhad Hassan. 
Put it on speaker. 
This is Jack Bauer. Go ahead. 
How close are you? 
Ten minutes out. Are you okay? 
There's someone here. 
They're close. 
They're looking for me. 
Please... hurry. 
Madam President. 
I'm told you have my brother. 
What happened? 
Please. 
He called CTU and surrendered himself. 
I don't understand. 
The men that Farhad was working with turned against him, and they have taken the nuclear rods. 
Now, he believes that they intend to construct a dirty bomb to attack this city. 
Now, apparently, these men are members of your covert intelligence operations here in the United States. 
I find that hard to believe. 
Well, your brother has no reason to lie. 
By turning himself in, he's facing the death penalty. 
We have to assume he's telling the truth. 
I need for you to give us intelligence files for every asset you have in this country so Farhad can identify these terrorists. 
Mr. President, 
I have given you a great deal of latitude to sort out your domestic situation, and now there is a threat to my homeland, and I need your cooperation. 
I suggest you turn Farhad over to me and let my people question him. 
We'll get the answers you need. 
There's no time for thate'a Cm moving on Farhad as we speak. 
They need to question him on site. 
I need the files. 
What you're asking is a serious breach of our security. 
I understand that. 
But you need to understand that if this radiological attack takes place, I will be forced to retaliate. 
You would attack... 
my country? 
I will have no choice. 
I need those files... 
and I need them now. 
I'll call my acting head of security. 
You'll get the files in a few minutes. 
Thank you. 
I want you to know, Tarin, that I don't believe you are guilty of treason. 
But I have no choice but to follow orders. 
You don't have to explain yourself, Nabeel. 
I would do the same thing in your position. 
I don't hold any of this against you. 
Whatever happens to me, you must not blame yourself. 
Never forget that. 
I appreciate that. 
Don't move. What 
are you doing? 
Nabeel, give me your weapon now. 
Slowly, two fingers. 
Come on. 
Driver, pull over here. 
Remove your seat belts. 
Put your hands on your head, both of you. 
Get out of the car now. 
Don't move. 
Give me the keys. 
Put your hands down. 
Tarin, don't do this. 
You'll only make things worse for yourself. 
You know what they'll do to me at our embassy. 
It can't be any worse. 
It's President Hassan. 
Give it to me. 
Come on! 
Let's go. In the back. 
Open it up. 
Take out your cuffs. 
Lock yourselves down. 
Nabeel isn't answering. 
Where is he? 
Transporting Tarin to the embassy. 
Keep trying to reach him on his mobile. 
If he doesn't answer, send a security team to track him. 
Yes, sir. 
And contact Colonel Al Jhanis. 
Tell him on my authority to give CTU access to the files they requested. 
Yes, sir. 
Hello. 
It's me. Where are you? 
I'm leaving the U.N. right now. 
Is everything all right? 
Yes, it worked. 
Meet me at the hotel. 
I'll be there in ten minutes. 
I love you, Kayla. 
I'll see you soon. 
Go ahead, Mr. Hastings. 
Farhad, are you there? 
Yes, yes, I'm here. 
Our field team is approaching the south entrance. 
Stay where you are until they secure the site. 
He's almost on me. 
I can't stay here. 
Do not move until they lock down that shooter. 
Do you understand me? 
Farhad? 
Farhad?! 
Farhad, talk to me. 
Over here! 
Medic! Come on! Medic! 
JACK: That's him, that's Farhad. 
Owen, take your team and sweep the area. 
Chloe, we've got Farhad, but he's been hit. 
I need those files immediately. 
I.R.K. intelligence 
just sent them over. 
Good. 
Yes? 
It's done. 
Farhad is no longer a problem. 
Are you sure? 
I shot him twice, but the police arrived, and I had to get out of there. 
You know where to find us. 
Yes. 
Mr. Bauer. 
Speak to me. We have two large 
caliber slugs to the abdomen. 
He's bleeding out. I don't think 
he's going to make it to the hospital. 
Do whatever you have to do to stabilize him. 
We need to talk to him now. Go! 
This is B team. 
We found their truck, but there's no sign of the rods. 
Let me know as soon as these files are uploaded. 
Mr. Hassan, in a few seconds, 
I'm going to show you photographs of covert operatives working for your country within the United States. 
I need you to identify the men who stole the nuclear rods from you. Can you 
do that for us? 
Yes. 
Are those files uploaded yet?! 
Almost. Come on! 
Blood pressure's dropping. 
We've got a rapid heartbeat. 
What the hell's happening? 
He's going into shock. 
Give me 20 cc's epinephrine. 
You keep that man alive, do you understand me? 
Keep him alive! 
Let me do my job! 
The telepresence conference is ready, Madam President. Thank you. 
Good to see you, gentlemen. 
Madam President, Brian Hastings at CTU has brought us up to speed, and we're ready to review some specifics with you. 
Good. I'm listening. 
If you would refer to your monitor... 
and the diagram of Midtown Manhattan. 
According to CTU, the stolen nuclear rods have a maximum explosive yield of 300 pounds. 
That's enough radiological material to contaminate approximately one square mile. 
If the device were detonated in a more densely populated area of Manhattan, we could be looking at casualties in the tens of thousands. 
Dr. Landry? 
Most of the deaths would be from severe radiation poisoning. 
The remainder of the victims would expire from radiation induced illnesses. 
Primarily leukemia and other cancers. 
We also have to consider that the affected area would be rendered uninhabitable for approximately 40 years. 
Obviously a citywide evacuation is out of the question. 
That's right. There are 
millions of people on this island with few points of egress. 
It would take days to get them out. 
Not to mention that going public with this information would cause mass panic. 
I agree. We need to keep this 
threat from the public for now. 
Focus our efforts on making sure that this attack never happens. 
CTU believes the nuclear rods are still outside the city, so they're fortifying radiation detection efforts at the bridges and tunnels. 
We are also hardening high value targets such as the financial district, landmarks, subways. 
But we can't ignore that the U.N. may also be a target. 
Give the danger, I think we should evacuate the entire building. 
We can resume the conference from a safe location. 
All right, inform the delegates of the situation. 
Thank you, gentlemen. 
CTU has your brother in custody. 
He's been shot. 
They're trying to stabilize him. 
Yes? 
Sir, Agent Rahim is calling for you. 
He says he's located Nabeel. 
Put him through. 
Mr. President, we found 
Nabeel and his driver locked down in the back of their vehicle. 
Tarin has escaped. What?! 
Nabeel wishes to speak to you, sir. 
Yes, okay, put him on. 
I'm sorry, Mr. President. 
Tarin had the gun with him. 
I don't understand how. 
Are you saying somebody helped him escape? 
It would seem so. 
But Mr. President, 
there's something else you need to know. 
Right after he escaped, I overheard Tarin on the phone. 
I believe he was speaking to your daughter. 
Kayla? Are you 
sure about this? 
Yes, sir. 
It sounded like he was going to meet her somewhere in the city. 
Kayla, call me back. 
Call me back, Kayla. 
Come inside. 
Oh, thank God, you're all right. 
Oh! 
I contacted an American lawyer I know who's an expert at international law. 
He's agreed to meet us in two hours. 
This is such a terrible situation. 
Yet I've never felt so happy. 
I feel the same. 
Mm! 
Mr. Bauer, we did our best. 
He didn't make it. 
I know you did. Thanks. 
We swept the area, sir. It's clear. 
No hostiles. No trace 
of the nuclear rods. 
Copy that. 
CTU, this is Bauer. 
We lost him. Farhad's dead. 
Damn it. 
I still think we've got another play. 
Whoever shot Farhad couldn't confirm that he was killed. 
We came up on him too fast. 
They don't know how badly he was wounded. 
So what are you proposing, Jack? 
I'm saying that we use Farhad as dead bait. 
Leak it to the press that we've got him in custody, and he survived. 
We're transporting him to a local hospital where authorities are going to question him. 
They'll have to make a move on him. 
He knows too much. 
Sounds like a Hail Mary. 
Right now it's the only play we've got. 
But if they make a move on Farhad, which I think they will, we'll be waiting for them. 
Mr. Hastings, you 
said you wanted me in till this was resolved. This is it. 
We have Hassan's intelligence files. 
We can scan and cross-reference with facial recognition software. 
Maybe spot the terrorists before they attack. 
All right, Jack. 
It's not exactly standard procedure ferrying a dead man's body across the city, but I'm willing to give it a shot. 
We'll figure out a hospital route and put a press statement together. 
You get ready on your end. 
Okay, thank you. 
Get that body ready for transport. 
Owen, assemble your men. 
Briefing in less than five. 
rial one is in position over the route, sir. 
Sniper teams have checked in. They're all in place. 
Come on, hurry up. 
Let's go. 
It's over, Dana. 
Let's get the other body and get cleaned up before we head back to CTU. 
Cole, what about us? 
I don't know. 
We have just received word from New York Counterterrorist Headquarters that Farhad Hassan- brother of Islamic Republic of Kamistan President Omar Hassan has been found alive. 
We're told that Farhad Hassan contacted CTU a short while ago and agreed to turn him over to authorities. 
Farhad is alive. 
What? 
CTU responded immediately, but when they arrived, they found him shot. 
No word yet on how Farhad Hassan sustained these gunshot injuries, but we do know that he is expected to survive, and he's being transported to St. Julian's Hospital 
under heightened security where he will be questioned by authorities. 
This is impossible. 
Farhad Hassan has been on the run since early this evening... 
I shot him twice. 
But you didn't make sure he was dead. 
I told you I didn't have time! 
I'll make this right. I'll go back. 
You're too conspicuous. 
Farhad will be heavily protected. 
But if Farhad talks, the authorities could find us before we can build the weapon. 
You think we don't know the implications? 
We're sending Marcos. 
His mother's American. 
They won't suspect him. 
He's in the truck with the rods. 
The peace treaty may now be halted due to a series of alleged terrorist attacks. 
Hello? 
Mom, it's me. 
Marcos? 
Yes. Listen, I 
can't talk for long. 
What is it? Are you okay? 
I'm fine, Mom. 
I need you to do something for me. 
It's very important. 
Okay. 
Okay. What is it? 
I need you to get up right now and leave the city. 
Go to Aunt Shelley's. 
Aunt Shelley's?! 
Just do it for me, okay? 
Don't ask me why. 
Leave right now. 
Marcos, this is crazy... 
I'm not gonna leave the apartment in the middle of the night for no reason. 
There's a reason; I just can't tell you what it is right now. 
Please, Mom, do this for me. 
Where are you? 
Don't worry about me. 
Well, I'm not going anywhere unless I know you're all right. 
I'll meet you at Aunt Shelley's, and I'll explain everything. 
Go, Mom, now. 
Okay, I'm leaving. 
I have to go. I love you. 
Are you ready, my friend? 
Yes. 
Good. 
It's time. 
You need to keep him looking alive the entire way. 
You're all clear on what you need to do? 
Yes, sir. 
Jack, it's Hastings. Go ahead. 
We've coordinated with news outlets. 
They put out the false report of Farhad's arrest and transport to the hospital for questioning. 
The hook has been baited. 
Okay. The most 
logical place for them to attack is when we're en route. 
That's where we're gonna be our most vulnerable. 
Well, NYPD and SWAT are mobilizing now. 
They're going to be embedded at strategic points along the way. 
They're also securing St. Julian's Hospital. 
Copy that. Tell 
the support teams it is imperative that we take these terrorists alive. 
They've been briefed, Jack. 
Okay, we're moving out. 
You two take the follow van. 
Owen, you're with me in the ambulance. 
Copy that. 
Hey, are you all right? 
Yes, sir. 
Look, I know you and your men have not had a lot of field experience, and we have put you in an extreme situation. 
But I promise you, if we're attacked, every part of this route is covered. 
We've got a lot of support out there. 
I'm fine, Mr. Bauer. 
Let's do this. 
Yeah. 
Our delegation is preparing to head to McGuire Air force Base. 
We'll be setting up a temporary ops center there, where we'll be able to monitor the situation. 
And the other delegates? 
U.N. Security will 
coordinate the evacuation. 
Everything should go smoothly. 
Can I get you anything, Madam President? 
No, thank you, Rob. 
You have done more than enough. 
I'm just sorry that your first few months on the job have been so challenging. 
I wouldn't have had it any other way. 
I'll see you in a moment. 
I spoke to one of my aides. 
He told me my brother is... dead. 
I'm afraid so. 
When CTU is finished with their operation, I would like Farhad's remains to be returned to my country. 
Personally, I don't care where his body rots, but my mother will want a proper burial. 
I'll see that it's done. 
But right now, Mr. President, 
we must all evacuate the U.N. 
I'm not leaving, Madame President. 
I'm staying here. 
I don't understand. 
My daughter Kayla is missing. 
Missing? 
Kayla is romantically involved with my former head of security. 
She's run off with him. 
Tell me what we can do to help. 
I appreciate that, but my security teams are searching for her now. 
I understand how worried you must be, but there is nothing that you can do to help her by staying here. 
Please come where you'll be safe. 
I can't, Madam President. 
She's somewhere in the city, with no idea that a nuclear threat exists. 
I won't go anywhere until she's been found. 
All right. 
I understand. 
I will talk to you very soon. 
Thank you. 
They're turning west Sixth Street. 
Pulling into the hospital. 
Chloe, bring up the hospital security feed. 
Get facial recognition up and running. 
CTU, this is Bauer. We're 
moving into position. 
Farhad's body's been taken to his room. 
Let's go! 
Secure these doors! 
Bring up the exterior cameras. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack, it's me. 
Hey. 
I've been released. 
I'm free to go. 
Good. 
Chloe told me what you did. 
You leveraged Hastings. 
Said that you would head up field ops until this crisis was over in exchange for CTU dropping any possible charges against me. 
I didn't ask you to do that, Jack. 
I know you didn't. 
Look, someone in the White House is trying to set you up to take responsibility for the failure of our mission, and I couldn't let that happen because you did nothing wrong. 
You understand me? 
Renee, you need to let this go. 
You're not responsible for what's happening Yeah, okay. 
Hey, I meant what I said earlier. 
When this is over, I want to be there for you... 
with you. 
I'd like that. 
I'll have a CTU agent take you to my apartment. 
I'll meet you there when this is over. 
All right, Jack. 
Look, I'm getting chatter over the comm. I gotta go. 
Okay, bye. 
This is Bauer. Go ahead. 
Jack, facial recognition just picked up a match with the I.R.K. 
intelligence files. 
His name's Marcos Al-Zacar. 
American-born. 
Working undercover with the I.R.K. 
for the last three years. 
Where is he? 
Approaching the side entrance. 
Brown hair, blue scrubs, wearing aÃ© dark-blue jacket. 
Copy that. 
Hold on, Jack. he's got 
something in his hand. 
It looks like a remote detonator. 
I think he's wearing a vest. 
Chloe, can you disarm it from there? 
Possibly, if I can pin down the detonator model, I may be able to scramble the arming code using the transmitter in the mobile comm. 
Get on it. Owen, 
you've got a man approaching your position. 
He's got brown hair. 
He's wearing green scrubs and a blue jacket. 
Yeah. I see him. 
He's our hitter. We believe 
he's wearing an explosive vest with a remote detonator. 
Okay. What should I do? 
Stay calm and do whatever he asks. 
CTU techs are going to try and disarm the vest from offsite. 
Okay. 
Owen? 
Owen. 
You can do this. 
Just try and slow him down as much as possible. 
We've got you covered every inch of the way. 
Yes, sir. 
Excuse me. This 
is a secure area. 
I'm going to need to see some I.D. 
Listen to me very carefully. 
I have a bomb. 
Give me your weapon right now, or I'll kill us both. 
Your weapon now. 
Okay. Okay. 
Just take it easy. 
Slowly. 
Yeah. 
Where is Farhad Hassan? 
Third floor. 
Take me to him. 
Anyone asks who I am, you say I'm a doctor, and I'm cleared. 
Come on, son. 
Okay. 
Move. 
Okay. Go. 
Hello? 
Dalia, it's me. 
We need to talk. 
Don't try to change my mind, Omar. 
I told you, I'm leaving. 
I haven't called to change your mind. 
I called because Kayla may be in danger. 
What do you mean? 
She's run away with Tarin. 
They've been seeing each other. 
I know. 
How long have you known? 
What difference does it make, Omar? 
What kind of danger is she in? 
Farhad is dead. 
The nuclear material he tried to acquire is in the hands of the terrorists. 
They're going to use it here in Manhattan. 
No. 
How did this happen? 
I'll explain later. 
But right now you need to call Kayla. 
I've left messages, but she won't return my calls. 
But she might talk to you. 
Please, Dalia. 
She's angry at me. 
I had Tarin arrested. 
I thought he was part of the conspiracy. 
All right. 
But Omar, what about you? 
Don't worry about me. 
Just help me find our daughter. 
I- I'll try. 
Sabira, I need the captain. 
Chloe, it's Jack. We're 
moving to the third floor. 
Where are we at with the vest? 
I've identified the detonator, Jack. 
It's German-made, K7 variant, but that model is used in a lot of configurations. 
I'm going to need a visual on the vest. 
Copy that. 
Owen, it's Jack. 
CTU cannot disarm the vest unless they see it. 
I need you to get the hostile underneath one of the surveillance cameras and make him show it to you. 
I repeat, CTU cannot disarm the vest unless they see it. 
You ready? 
Team three, they're approaching your position. 
What are you doing? 
I want to see proof. 
Proof of what? 
A bomb. 
I don't believe you have one. 
You don't keep moving, you're gonna find out. 
Right now. 
You want Farhad, you show me. 
I said, "Move." 
No. 
Owen did it, Jack. 
I've got a visual on the vest. 
Now, move. 
Okay. 
We're set in position near Farhad's room. 
Now, what's the status? 
It's a DDR configuration. 
I just need to pull up the frequency of the receiver. 
Chloe, you've got about 30 seconds before they reach that room. 
Got it. 
3.15 gigahertz, standard GSM. 
Running it through the mobile comm now. 
This'll take a few seconds. 
Stand by for assault. 
On the floor, face down! 
Do it now! 
Don't move! 
Come on, Arlo. Hurry up. 
That's it. It's done. 
Jack, the vest is disarmed. 
Move in. Go, go, go! 
It's all right. 
It's all right. 
Lower your weapons. 
It's all right. 
I'm going to put my gun away. 
We're not here to hurt you. 
We just want to talk. 
Stay calm. 
It's all right. 
I just want to talk to you. 
No. No! 
He's still moving. 
Notify the perimeter. 
Do not fire! He's unarmed! 
This is Bauer. 
I'm in the east wing. 
Suspect has barricaded himself in some kind of pressure chamber. 
I need a team down here now to help me open the door. 
Yes? 
It was a trap. 
Farhad was already dead. 
What? The police were waiting. 
They tried to ambush me, but I got away. 
Where are you? 
I locked myself inside some kind of oxygen chamber. 
They can't get in here. 
At least not yet. 
You know what you must do. 
I can't. 
I- I think they-they scrambled the arming code. 
You need to set it off manually. 
I don't know how to do that. 
I'll talk you through it. 
Can you open the detonator control? 
Yeah. I-I think so. 
Um, it's going to take a minute. 
Work quickly. 
You cannot let them take you alive. 
Can you hear me? 
I just want to talk. 
tvsubtitles.net & bierdopje.com 
Someone needs to take the reins of the IRK government. 
Someone who believes in the same ideals and principles as Omar Hassan and who shares his strength. 
If it is the will of my people, I will take my husband's place at the peace conference. 
Did you find him, President Taylor the man who killed my father? 
Samir Mehran, yes. 
He was badly wounded, but he'll live to stand trial. 
I took care of him. 
So there is no connection to us. 
We're in the clear? 
Maybe not. 
There was a woman there who might have recognized me. 
What woman? 
She may be CTU. 
I'm not sure, but I've seen her face before. 
Once again, Mr. Novakovich, 
you're giving every indication that Russia has no interest in this peace ac I don't understand how you can believe that installing Hassan's widow will alleviate our concerns about the instability of the IRK government. 
I have close friends in Moscow. 
Do you honestly think your relationships can change their minds? 
Let's just say I'm going to be able to exercise some leverage. 
Jack thinks that someone inside of CTU is working for the terrorists. 
I spoke to Hastings. 
He cleared me through. 
Stay where you are and keep your hands where I can... 
She just entered the parking garage. 
Who are you, you lying bitch? 
Don't move. 
Renee! 
Renee! 
You were on the phone with her right before she got shot. 
What were you talking about? 
Samir Mehran was given a lethal injection at the scene of his capture. 
Renee thought she recognized one of the EMTs from her days undercover with the Russian mob. 
I, I've got to get back to you. 
I'm sorry. 
She didn't make it. 
Sir? 
Sir, I'm so sorry, but we need to move her now. 
Sir, are you the husband of the deceased? 
No. 
Well, we need to contact her next of kin. 
Can you help us with that? 
Do you know where her parents live? 
Are they alive? 
I don't know. 
Sir, are you gonna be all right? 
I don't know if these will fit. 
I got them from an intern. 
Thank you. 
Yeah? 
Jack, I heard about Renee. 
I'm so sorry. 
What can I do to help? 
Tell me who did this. 
You told me earlier Renee thought she recognized someone at Hassan's crime scene. 
An EMT? 
Let us deal with that. 
We have everyone here working on it. 
Don't try and handle me, Chloe, not now. 
Who did she see? 
She thought she recognized somebody from the Russian mob Red Square. 
Bazhaev's group? 
Right. 
I want to talk to him. 
Like I said, I'm already on it. 
He's in custody somewhere, Chloe. 
I brought him in myself. 
Where is he? 
There's something that you need to know. 
Division replaced Hastings... 
with me. 
That means I'm responsible for what happens to Bazhaev. 
I know you're upset about Renee. 
So am I. 
But Bazhaev's our only lead. 
I need whoever talks to him to be in complete control. 
I don't think that's you right now. 
I won't interfere with your investigation. 
You think you can stick to that? 
I give you my word. 
Chloe, I'm gonna ask you one more time: Where is he? 
He's in federal court downtown. 
He's being arraigned right now. 
Plan was for this chamber to be full by now. 
Ethan, what in the world are you doing here? 
You should be resting. 
The doctor said it was my call. 
Ethan... 
I'm fine. 
I was thinking, Madam President, our discussion about enlisting Charles Logan. 
It's done. 
You've contacted him already? 
He's on his way to talk to the Russian Foreign Minister. 
Whew! That was fast. 
The Russians were about to announce they were pulling out of the talks. 
I didn't see a lot of options. 
So, what's his angle? 
Madam President, you said he's on his way to talk to Novakovich. 
How does he intend to get the Russians to stay? 
I assume he uncovered something in his business dealings with them. 
But you don't know what it is? 
Not exactly. 
Madam President, he's operating in your name. 
Shouldn't we find out? 
I agreed I wouldn't. 
Don't ask, don't tell was the price for Logan's cooperation. 
Mikhail! 
Mr. President. 
The Russian people join you in mourning President Hassan. 
His death was a tragedy for all peace-loving nations. 
You can save your platitudes. 
You want the truth. 
Why not... for a change? 
Espresso. 
I assume President Taylor sent you here to bring my country back to the bargaining table. 
She is going to be disappointed. 
President Taylor lured the whole world here with the promise that Hassan had united the IRK, that there would be peace for the first time in decades. 
Well, now it is clear that was a lie. 
There was no unity even with Hassan, and now that he is gone... 
...his widow Dalia can pick up 
the mantle. 
Not in our estimation. 
Hassan was undone by his own opposition. 
How could his widow possibly succeed where he failed? 
'Cause we both know the opposition that undid him had outside help. 
Nuclear threats, assassination plots against a heavily guarded head of state. 
This was not some Third World malcontents lashing out. 
This was a highly organized effort orchestrated by a major rival to the United States, a rival convinced that their best interest was to stop the peace process by killing Hassan. 
If you are insinuating... 
Insinuating, no. 
I'm saying it was people inside your government, first among them you. 
That is an outrageous accusation. 
It's a fact for which I have proof. 
I don't believe you. 
Well, that's your right. 
But I'll tell you this: you don't want to test me. 
Because what I have, I will share with President Taylor if you and I fail to come to an understanding here. 
Espresso, sir. 
At this point President Taylor knows nothing about any of this. 
I didn't see what good could come out of inflaming the situation between our countries further, not without talking to you first. 
And now I have. 
The president's expecting me at the UN. 
I need to go. 
What will you tell her? 
What I'd would like to tell her is that Russia is back at the table and her peace process is on track. 
But if neither of us hears from you before I get there, I'm afraid what I'll have to tell her instead is the unvarnished truth. 
"Sergei... 
Buh-zay-off." 
Bazhaev, Your Honor. 
We'd like to waive reading. 
I'm sure you would, given the charges here. 
I can tell you right now I'm gonna deny bail. 
Judge Ruffin, Sergei Bazhaev is a businessman with deep ties to this community. 
He's a foreign national. 
That's true, Your Honor, but he has lived in this country continuously since 1985. 
His entire family lives here. 
In fact, several members of his family are represented in court today: his wife, daughter-in-law, grandson, for whom incidentally he is the sole means of support. 
According to the charges, he's their sole support because he killed the boy's father, not to mention the other counts: trafficking in nuclear materials, assassination, conspiracy. 
Like I said, I'm going to deny bail. 
I'm remanding him to Marion immediately. 
Your Honor, may I have five minutes with my client, please? 
Fine. You have five minutes. 
Court will recess for 30 minutes. 
Clear the courtroom, please. 
My client would like to have a word with you. 
If you touch my family, I swear to God I... 
You're not really sitting in the right chair to be making threats. 
Who shot Renee Walker? 
I don't know that name. 
She was a former FBI Agent. 
Approximately six years ago, she worked undercover in your organization. 
Earlier today, she recognized one of your men as Red Square. 
There is no Red Square. 
Not anymore. 
Let me explain myself. 
This Agent, Renee Walker I considered her to be my family. 
So take a long hard look into my eyes and realize that I will have no problem taking out each member of yours before they even get home today unless I get the information I want. 
Whoever killed her had nothing to do with me. 
Enjoy your time at Marion. 
I'll tell your wife and your daughter-in-law you said hello. 
Wait. 
Wait! 
If I tell you, they'll kill my family anyway. 
We'll provide them with witness protection. 
I give you my word. 
Moscow. 
The Russian government they're behind it, not me. 
Everything that happened today, all of it, was them. 
Who inside the government? 
I don't know. 
What do you mean, you don't know? You're talking 
about 100,000 people. 
I need names. 
I don't know names. 
They never let me get close. 
The woman working for them arranged everything. 
What woman? 
The one they planted at CTU. 
Dana Walsh. 
Sir, let's go. 
You promised. 
You promised. 
Nerve-wracking, isn't it? 
Waiting. 
I only saw Novakovich's face, sir, but you definitely had his attention. 
It's the president. 
Charles Logan. 
Charles. 
Yes, Madam President. 
I just got off the phone with the Russian foreign minister. 
You did? 
And what did he say? 
He said that the two of you had a very interesting discussion. 
And that he would be coming to the United Nations in five hours with the Russian premier to sign the treaty as scheduled. 
He also said the credit for that is all yours. 
Oh, uh, he was in the mood to be convinced, Madam President. 
Mr. President, 
Ethan Kanin here. 
So you're back on your feet. 
Yes. 
And I'm curious. 
What did you say to the Russian minister to convince him to come back to the peace talks? 
I told him that peace is in all of our interests. 
Seriously, I'd like to know how you did it. 
Madam President, those-those details are for me alone. 
That was our agreement. 
Am I right? 
Yes, you are. 
So, Ethan, um, let's not do anything to-to sully our victory. 
And it is a victory. 
For all of us. 
It's a good feeling, isn't it? 
What? 
Being of service. 
To your country. 
Yes, it is. 
I'll see you at the UN shortly. 
O'Brian. 
Hey, it's me. 
Bazhaev's family just left the courthouse. 
They're going to need witness protection. 
I want you to pick them up and bring them in. 
What did he say? 
He said the people who are behind Renee's murder weren't Russian mob. 
Said they were people inside the Russian government. 
He claims that Moscow is behind everything that happened today. 
I thought the IRK opposition was trying to stop Hassan. 
No, he said the Russians were just using them. 
He didn't have time to explain why they don't want the peace accord to go through, but he did say something important. 
He said Moscow's main contact on the ground was Dana Walsh. 
Dana? You believe that? 
That would explain how she managed to breach CTU. 
Anyways, I'm on my way in. 
I want to talk to her. 
I'll set it up. 
Thanks. 
Cole, I need your help. 
Jack's on his way here to interview Dana. 
Dana? What about? 
According to Jack, she's some kind of Agent with the Russian government. 
He says they're behind everything that happened today, including Renee's murder. 
Listen, if Dana knows who killed Renee or Jack thinks she's in any way responsible, there's no telling what he might do. 
Jack respects you. 
You might be the only one who can deal with things if he gets out of hand. 
I know this is difficult for you, but during the questioning... 
Yeah, I'll be there. 
Thanks. 
It's good to be back in the game, even if it is through the rear entrance. 
President Taylor's worried about her image. 
Huh, believe me, I of all people understand that. 
She can't keep you hidden away forever, sir. 
That's right. 
Credit given where credit is due. 
Publicly. 
That's our deal. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Uh-huh. 
Right. 
Okay. 
Mm-hmm. 
No, no, believe me, the president will be grateful to know. 
Okay. 
Who is that Agent? 
I want him reassigned. 
Sir, that was one of my contacts at Justice just... 
Did you hear me?! 
Yes. 
I'll take care of it. 
But we have a more immediate problem: Jack Bauer. 
Bauer? 
What does he have to do with any of this? 
He was just downtown at the federal courthouse, the arraignment of a Sergei Bazhaev. 
Bauer got to him behind closed doors and got him to talk. 
How much does this Bazhaev know? 
He knows about Dana Walsh, the mole the Russians planted at CTU. 
I know who she is. 
Bauer's headed to CTU, presumably to talk to her. 
Sir, my sources tell me Walsh hasn't given up anything about Moscow's involvement. 
Not yet. 
But she knows enough to bring everything down. 
If she gets in a room with Bauer... 
Obviously, that can't happen. 
We need to stop Bauer before he talks to her. 
That won't be easy. 
He may have a personal stake in this. 
Apparently, he was asking Bazhaev about a Renee Walker. 
She was shot dead in Bauer's apartment less than an hour ago. 
Sir, this could easily get out of hand. 
You may need to ask President Taylor to intervene. 
What are you suggesting, that I tell her the truth? 
If she finds out what the Russians have done, she'll be furious I kept her out of it. 
She might back out of our deal. 
Sir, you really need to stop Bauer now. 
I don't see any other way. 
You have to talk to the president. 
Bauer torpedoed my presidency. 
Tried to ruime; almost did. 
There's no way I'm gonna let that happen again. 
Thank you. 
Dana Walsh ready? 
Yes, I'll take you to her. 
I'm so sorry about Renee. 
I don't even know what to say. 
Dana know I'm going to be interrogating her? 
No, I didn't want to give her a heads-up. 
Good. 
Jack. 
I'm sorry about Renee. 
I have to leave the cameras on, Jack. 
You think I'm gonna kill her? 
I wouldn't blame you if you did. 
If I wanted her dead, Chloe, she'd be dead. 
I'm just gonna wake her up to the idea of it. 
Open the door. 
What do you want? 
I want to know who killed Renee Walker. 
Renee's dead? 
Yeah. 
That doesn't make any sense. 
It... it must have 
been a mistake. 
No mistake. 
I'm sorry... Jack. 
Really. 
You're sorry? 
You're sorry? 
I want to know who the shooter was! 
I want to know ordered it! 
I want names now! 
Stop him! 
Let it play, Chloe. 
You hit me, and you get nothing. 
You think you get to make demands here? 
I can give you the hitter, the man behind him, all the way up to the top. 
I want more than just names. I want proof! 
I have proof: an audio file, film. 
Where? 
First I want my immunity deal back. 
Soon as I start talking, I'm dead. 
Your move, Jack. 
If you lie to me... 
I'll find you no matter where you try and hide. 
You understand that? 
Good. 
We've had such little good news these last few hours, I wanted to tell you right away. 
The delegates have voted unanimously to accept you as the representative of the IRK at the signing of the treaty. 
I'm pleased. 
Thank you for all your efforts. 
You're welcome. 
There is one proviso, of course. 
That my own country accept me as signatory of the treaty. 
I know you've had very little time to pursue this. 
Jamot and I have been making progress. 
In the next hour, our constituent assembly will vote on the issue, but as we've already received pledges of loyalty from most of my husband's coalition, I believe we have a good chance of success. 
Excellent. Dalia, 
we might just make it yet. 
We might. 
Madam President, Mrs. Hassan. 
I need a word. 
Excuse me. 
Logan wants to speak with you. 
About what? 
He wouldn't say except that it's urgent. 
He's waiting in your office. 
Following President Hassan's death, the expectation was that the delegates to the peace conference would have to pack up and go home, but the latest rumors coming out of the UN are pretty sensational: that Dalia Hassan might be stepping into her husband's shoes. 
In fact, there are already street demonstrations taking place in Kamistan in support of Dalia Hassan's candidacy. 
Does this mean the... 
Mr. Logan, 
the president is here. 
Thank you. 
We don't know, but... 
Thank you for seeing me, Madam President. 
Ethan said you wanted to speak with me. 
Um, can we have the room, please? 
What's this about, Charles? 
Jack Bauer he's out of control. 
He's already pressured a Russian mafioso in federal court, and now he's on his way to question a woman in custody at CTU: Dana Walsh. 
Why does he want to talk to her? 
He thinks she knows who's behind the, uh, the shooting of a Renee Walker. 
Agent Walker? 
She's dead? 
How did this happen? 
That's still being investigated, but in the meantime, what I'm saying is Bauer needs to be stopped. 
Why? 
You're going to have to trust me. 
What we need to do right now is lock Bauer down. 
You better tell me exactly what's going on. 
Madam President... 
No! 
I won't do a thing about Jack Bauer until you tell me the truth. 
Elements inside the Russian government were behind both the asssination of President Hassan and the supply of nuclear material to his enemies. 
The Russian government? 
Why do you think they're back at the table? 
Because I threatened to expose their role in today's events. 
You knew about this and you didn't tell anyone? 
I was trying to protect the president. 
Protect her?! 
You've compromised her hopelessly! 
Why didn't you say anything before? 
I told you that I had leverage with the Russians. 
You-you must have understood it was significant. 
Significant, yes! 
Evidence of a sex scandal, some kind of financial malfeasance, not this, for God's sake! 
If I find that you were in a position to prevent anything... 
Absolutely not. 
This information came to me only very recently. 
From whom? 
I can't tell you. 
You will tell me. 
I can't, Madam President, because it would do no good. 
My sources would plausibly deny even knowing me. 
The Russian involvement that's what Jack Bauer is about to bring out into the open? 
If he talks to Dana Walsh, yes. 
The Russians inserted her at CTU months ago. 
She was their Agent. 
If Bauer gets to her, it will all come out, and then, and then this, this will all be finished. 
It's finished anyways. 
Do you think the president wants anything more to do with the Russians after what they've done? 
Yes, yes, you do, Madame President, because you are looking at the bigger picture, the greater good. 
How can you call any of this good?! 
Because it is good, an undeniable good! 
A peace that's escaped the world for generations! 
That's what you're on the verge of achieving. 
Do you really want to throw it all away? 
Do you really think Dalia Hassan will sit down at the table with the people who murdered her husband? 
Who says she has to know? 
Believe me, I know how hard you worked for this, how you sweated and prayed, the sleepless nights. 
I know. 
The power to make a difference-- that's why we came into politics. 
How few of us get to achieve it, but you have... 
You so nearly have. 
Ethan will tell you to make a stand. 
I applaud his-his moral clarity, but then he's on the sidelines. 
He can afford it. 
That's enough! 
Is the situation ideal? No! 
Far from it, but you have a real chance to make the world a better place. 
Don't listen to this, Allison. 
If the treaty's not signed today, it's not the end. 
You can build a better peace, with honest partners. 
"There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune." 
What the hell does that mean? 
The president knows. 
It's from Julius Caesar. 
It means "Now or never." 
Madam President, I have Jack Bauer for you. 
Where is he? 
He's at CTU. 
He wants to talk to you about an immunity agreement for a Dana Walsh. 
I'll have to call him back. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Madam President, there is no choice here. 
But there is a choice, Ethan, and unfortunately, only I can make it. 
I'm going to CTU. 
To do what? 
To see Jack Bauer. 
Has the president called back yet? 
Not yet. 
Jack, are you sure you want to do this to yourself? 
We can take it from here. 
The minute Dana's immunity deal is back in place, we can roll up the names, close this out. 
I need to see this through. 
Excuse me. 
The president's on the phone, line 3. 
She asked for Chloe. 
Madam President. 
Ms. O'Brian, 
I'm on my way to see you. 
You're coming to CTU? 
Yes, I'm almost there. 
I need to talk to Jack Bauer. 
Make sure he doesn't leave. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Let Security know the president will be here any minute. 
She's coming here? 
That's what I just said. 
Have them standing by. 
Why's she doing this? 
She said she wants to talk to you. 
Why doesn't she just talk to me on the phone? 
I don't know. 
You should probably meet her in Hastings' office. 
Fine. 
Madame President, welcome to CTU. 
I'm Chloe O'Brian. 
Thank you, Ms. O'Brian. 
Is Jack inside? 
Right this way. 
I want to say how grateful I am for all your efforts today. 
We've taken some pretty hard hits, but we've managed to keep ourselves in the game. 
The peace process is still alive, and I am counting on your hard work and your vigilance to keep it that way. 
I know you won't let me down. 
Thank you, Miss O'Brian. 
Um, I'll go up alone. 
Hello, Jack. 
Madam President. 
I am so sorry about Agent Walker. 
I gather she meant a lot to you. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Which makes what I'm about to ask so very, very hard. 
Please, Jack. 
I need you to stand down. 
I-I'm sorry. I don't understand. 
I do not want you to question Dana Walsh. 
Madam President, the information that I can extract from Dana Walsh is not limited to the murder of Renee Walker. 
I believe she knows the names of the people who facilitated the assassination of President Hassan, people working within the Russian government. 
That is pure speculation. 
Then grant her immunity. 
Let me question her. 
If she's lying, you lose nothing. 
I'm sorry. I won't give 
Dana Walsh immunity. 
I can't. 
The peace process is back on track. 
Dalia Hassan will represent her country at the signing. 
The Russians have accepted her and have undertaken to support the treaty. 
Madam President, the Russians have been trying to destroy the treaty. 
You can't trust them. 
You don't know that. 
The information that I have came from Sergei Bazhaev, and I believe him. 
If you let me question Dana Walsh, I can prove it to you. 
No. 
I won't allow it. 
You don't want to know the truth. 
What I want is to keep the Russians at the table. 
Allegations of this sort will drive them away. 
What if the allegations are true? 
If I keep the Russians at the table, I can bring peace to a part of the world that has known nothing but war for generations. 
That is the greater good that I am working toward. 
And to achieve it, there have to be sacrifices! 
With all due respect, Madam President, these people gave nuclear weapons to terrorists who were willing to obliterate half of Manhattan! 
You don't know that! 
And I'm telling you, we have to move on. 
Even Hassan's widow has picked up the torch and is continuing the peace process. 
Does she know the Russians helped murder her husband? 
Do you think she'd be willing to sign that treaty if she knew that? 
Have you even told her? 
That's enough. 
Have you told her?! 
I said that's enough! 
This peace treaty is in the interests of the United States and of the world. 
That makes it a good in itself, and certainly more important than your desire for revenge. 
Madam President, I don't want revenge; I want justice. 
And I want peace. 
If there were another way, I would take it, but there's not. 
That's my decision. 
Do you understand? 
Do you understand, Jack? 
Yes, ma'am. 
I've arranged a helicopter to fly you from CTU to McGuire Air Force Base. 
You're locking me down. 
You'll be debriefed there. 
Good-bye, Jack. 
I'm sorry. 
I had them gather your things. 
Thanks. 
What happened up there? 
Nothing. 
What do you mean? 
I mean nothing. 
Nothing happened. 
What I need is a meeting with Dalia Hassan to coordinate our response to the likely questions. 
Will you set that up? 
Thank you. 
I'm leaving CTU now. 
I'll be with you in ten minutes. 
They said you wanted to see me. 
Yes. 
Dana Walsh is to remain locked down until further notice. 
No one gets access to her without my express permission. 
Is that clear? 
I guess. 
What about Jack? 
Jack is going to McGuire Air Force Base to be debriefed. 
He didn't seem very happy about that. 
He was disappointed that I wouldn't grant Dana Walsh immunity in exchange for her testimony. 
But Dana knows who's responsible for everything that's happened today. 
She is a sociopath. 
She'll say anything. 
And the last thing we need right now is a bunch of unfounded allegations derailing the peace that we've all worked so hard for. 
Do you understand, Chloe? 
We're having a press conference at the UN in two hours to present Dalia Hassan as the new leader of the IRK and to announce that the peace talks are still on track. 
What we need CTU to do is to make sure security is airtight. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Tim Woods speaks very highly of you. 
When the situation got out of control, he was quite adamant that you were the one to take over. 
I'm surprised he even knows who I am. 
It was a pleasure to meet you finally, Chloe. 
Thank you. 
Cole, we're gonna be back on UN detail. 
What's happening with Dana? 
As of now, nothing. 
What about the immunity agreement? 
There isn't gonna be one. 
Why not? 
The president says that Dana's a lying sociopath who will wreck the peace treaty. 
What's Jack say about that? 
I don't know. 
He's being choppered to McGuire for debriefing. 
Chloe, what the hell's going on? 
There's gonna be a press conference soon, and the president needs us to guarantee security. 
You'll need to get your teams ready. 
Okay. Fine. 
So Jack's being taken away for a debrief? 
About what, may I ask? 
No. 
Director O'Brian, this is Falcon One. 
We're touching down at CTU, ma'am. 
Copy that. 
Security personnel en route to the roof with Jack Bauer now. 
Mr. Bauer, 
Agent Winnick. 
The White House has instructed me to escort you to McGuire Air Force Base for a debrief. 
Heard a lot about you, sir. 
I'm sorry we had to meet under these circumstances. 
There's no reason to be sorry. 
Get in this helicopter. 
Tell your men to drop their weapons or you're gonna die. 
Arlo, pull up the audio. 
Something's happening. 
Coming up. 
Put your weapons down now! 
I will kill him! 
Everyone to the helipad. 
All security to the helipad now. 
What the hell is going on? 
He's gonna steal that helicopter. 
We have a hostage situation. 
Out of the copter now! 
Bauer took a hostage. 
Hijacking the helicopter. 
Hold your fire! 
Lower your weapons! 
Give me your walkie. 
Jack. 
Please land the chopper now. 
Jack, you know I have to call this in. 
The Air Force will force you down. 
This is a bad idea. 
Land the chopper now. 
Call the FAA, the Air Force. 
Tell them we have a stolen helicopter flying West over Manhattan that needs to be intercepted and forced down. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Can I assume there is no change in the status of President Hassan? 
I'm afraid not. 
Then he is still being held by terrorists. 
If Hassan dies, there is no treaty. 
If I didn't know better, I'd think you were hoping for that to happen. 
Jack thinks that someone inside of CTU is working for the terrorists. 
Jack recovered Tarin's cell phone from the crash. 
If someone did call and tip him off, we can get the number off the memory. 
It's Dana's phone. 
I spoke to Hastings. 
He cleared me through. 
Stay where you are and keep your hands where I can... 
She just entered the parking garage. 
The only reason you've got any leverage right now is because President Hassan is alive. 
So stop screwing with me! 
They are gonna force him to make a statement, and then they're going to kill him. 
Just read the statement, no more. 
You will renounce the peace agreement. 
I will never do that. 
He's stronger than we thought. 
Bury him. 
I will tell the world of his crimes. 
This man is not our president! 
He's an arrogant... 
Jack, looks like Samir's grabbed him. 
We need you to get in there right now! 
I have a visual on Hassan. 
Ready to engage. 
I'm sorry. 
Yes? 
Excuse me, ma'am. 
I have Jack Bauer on the line for you. 
Put him through. 
Jack... 
Madam President, I don't know what to say except that I'm sorry. 
I trust there was nothing you and your team could have done differently. 
No, ma'am. 
President Hassan was dead before we even got there. 
Then you don't owe me an apology. 
I failed you, ma'am. 
It was Hassan's choice to surrender himself in order to save American lives. 
It was out of your hands. 
Don't put this responsibility on yourself. 
Madam President, you need to keep this peace agreement alive. 
There can't be any agreement when the IRK is without a leader, Jack. 
The hardliners there will take advantage of the vacuum and-and reverse all the progress we made with Hassan. 
I'm gonna have to address the delegates in a few minutes and announce the dissolution of the peace summit, and, and formally release them. 
Ma'am, if you give up, it means they win. 
I don't see another choice, Jack. 
I-I wish to God I did. 
Good-bye, Jack. 
What's his condition? 
He took a round to the shoulder, another through the abdomen, but it exited clean. 
BP looks steady. 
Look, we need this guy for questioning. 
Is he going to make it or not? 
Doesn't look like any vitals were hit. 
He'll live. All right. 
We'll transport him back to CTU. 
Medical will take him for now. 
Jack. 
President Taylor is going to formally announce the end of the peace conference. 
Jack, you did everything you could. 
It wasn't enough. 
We should get back to CTU. 
Why? 
The fuel rods have been recovered. 
The peace conference is over. 
Everybody who was responsible is either dead or in custody. 
Cole. 
What's the status on Samir? 
He's still unconscious, but the EMTs say he'll make it. 
Okay, good. 
I want you to stay with him. 
I'm handing over complete authority and responsibility for his transport to you. 
Are you heading back to CTU? 
No. 
We're going home. We're done. 
Hastings is still probably going to want to debrief both of you. 
I'm sure he will. 
He knows how to find me. 
I'm sorry it ended up like this, Jack. 
Me, too. 
You're a good agent, Cole. 
I wouldn't be standing here without you. 
Thank you. 
I hope everything works out. 
I'll pack my kit up downstairs. 
Madam President. 
The delegates are assembled in the lounge, as you requested. 
Let's get this over with. 
Discontinue the peace summit that was to be a cornerstone of her administration. 
President Hassan apparently had been kidnapped earlier, and then taken to... 
Jamot. 
On behalf of my country, you have our deepest sympathy for this terrible tragedy. 
Though, on a personal level, I imagine you have mixed feelings right now. 
Beg your pardon? 
Hassan had you arrested without cause during his purge of suspected enemies. 
Allowed you to be brutally interrogated. 
I would think you have little love for the man. 
President Hassan was under tremendous duress, and he lost his way, but I never stopped believing in what he stood for. 
Of course. 
I meant no offense. 
I'm sure you didn't. 
Excuse me. 
While we have not learned the identity of the terrorist in the video... 
President Taylor. 
Minister Jamot. 
If you can spare a few moments, I need to speak with you. 
I will be happy to sit down with you after I have addressed the other delegations. 
I know you're intending to announce the end of the peace summit, but there may be a way to prevent that from happening. 
Before you do anything, I need you to hear what I have to say. 
All right. 
Ma'am, what about the delegates? 
Just... just give me a moment. 
Let's go in here. 
Please. 
Federal agents mounted an operation to rescue President Hassan from the terrorists that commenced approximately 30 minutes ago. 
Yes? 
Samir's men were all dead, thanks to the Americans. 
Samir was the only one left, but I took care of him. 
So, there's no connection to us? 
We're in the clear? 
Maybe not. 
There was a woman there who might have recognized me. 
What woman? 
She may be CTU... 
I'm not sure... but... 
I've seen her face before. 
Where? 
Six years ago, when we were using that mobster, Vladimir Laitanan, to smuggle military weapons out of the country, she was with him. 
Are you sure it was her? 
I don't forget faces. 
Where is she now? 
In a taxicab, just ahead of me, with Jack Bauer. 
Bauer? 
Are they going to CTU? 
I don't think so, no. 
Then, it seems unlikely she recognized you. 
Better not to take the chance. 
I'll take out Bauer, too, while I'm at it. 
The Americans believe the IRK were solely behind the recent attacks. 
Killing Bauer and this woman would only alert them to the fact that others were involved. 
How long before they discover that it was us? 
It will take even less time if this woman remembers me. 
What are my orders? 
Continue to follow them... 
keep them in sight... 
And I'll get back to you. 
I don't have the words to tell you and Kayla how sorry I am. 
I know you did everything in your power. 
Jamot, I wasn't aware that you were here. 
I only arrived a short time ago. 
I want you to know that, in our last few hours together, Omar expressed his regrets to me, not the least of which was his treatment of you. 
I appreciate that. 
Mrs. Hassan, I realize 
our timing is intrusive, but there's something we need to discuss privately. 
Did you find him, President Taylor? 
The man who killed my father? 
Samir Mehran. 
Yes. 
He was badly wounded, but he'll live to stand trial. 
And, believe me, he will pay dearly for what he's done. 
Kayla, darling, I need to speak with President Taylor alone. 
Give us a few minutes. 
What is it that you wish to talk to me about? 
Mrs. Hassan, as you know, 
for almost a year, your husband and I worked to make this peace agreement a reality. 
Now, in that time, I saw the kind of leader he was. 
He managed against difficult odds to bring a fractious and contentious parliament together. 
But, now that he's gone, your country is going to be thrown into turmoil. 
I am aware of the challenges that we are facing. 
Why are you telling me this? 
Clearly, someone needs to take the reigns of the IRK government. 
Someone who believes in the same ideals and principles as Omar Hassan, and who shares his strength. 
Minister Jamot believes that that person should be you. 
What?! 
I'm not the only one who believes it. 
I've spoken to our delegation, as well as with the other members of our cabinet back home. 
You represent our best. 
Our only real chance to preserve our government and your husband's agenda. 
You are out of your mind! 
I am no politician. 
But you are a martyr's wife. 
And history has proven that to be something far more powerful. 
You have always been popular with the people. 
The vast majority of them want peace. 
They will rally around you. 
The Council of Guardian will have no choice but to recognize you as successor to the presidency. 
But I have a choice. 
You assume too much of me, Jamot. 
I realize that this is a lot to consider, especially now while you're grieving, but without a unifying figure to hold your country together, everything your husband worked for will be for nothing. 
President Taylor, my marriage to Omar was far from perfect. 
We had many problems for a very long time. 
I know only too well how difficult it is for a marriage to survive a life in politics. 
But through it all, I never stopped loving him. 
Or sharing his desire for better relations with the West. 
If it is the will of my people and of my government, I will take my husband's place at the peace conference. 
It will be my honor to stand with you. 
We'll make the announcement together from the United Nations. 
Mrs. Hassan, 
thank you. 
She's going to do it. 
Oh, that's incredible news, Madam President. 
I want every delegate contacted personally. 
Tell them to cancel any plans to leave the country. 
We are returning to the UN. 
Yes, ma'am. 
I'll also call CTU and implement those changes we discussed if I still have your permission. 
That's your decision. 
Do what you think is best. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Where's Bauer? 
Jack left the scene, took Renee with him. 
Hassan's death hit him pretty hard. 
Samir's been taken to Medical to get patched up. 
Is he conscious? 
Barely. 
You let me know the second he's ready for questioning. 
All right. 
Put him through. 
CTU. O'Brian. 
This is Tim Woods with Homeland Security. 
Hold on. I'll put you through 
to Mr. Hastings. 
Oh, no. Actually, I'm calling 
to speak with you, Ms. O'Brian. 
Me? Are you sure? 
I know this is an unusual circumstance, so I'll get straight to the point. 
President Taylor and the foreign dignitaries are returning to the UN shortly where the president will announce her intent to move forward with the signing of the peace agreement. 
Well, excuse me, but how can she do that without President Hassan? 
I'm not at liberty to say just yet, but our immediate concern is whether CTU is capable of handling security for the rest of the process. 
It's already been infiltrated by an enemy agent, compromised more than once today. 
We cannot have any more mistakes. 
Are you suggesting I'm responsible for those mistakes? 
On the contrary. 
I reviewed the hourly reports, and from what I see, you've made some astute calls, and have proven to be very resourceful throughout this crisis. 
Okay. 
So why are you calling me? 
I'm relieving Brian Hastings of his post effective immediately. 
We're now in the process of vetting suitable candidates to replace him, but until we find someone, you'll have provisional command. 
You're... You're putting me 
in charge? 
For the time being. 
I know your record at CTU's L.A. branch, 
and how important you were during the Sangala crisis. 
There's nobody in that building that has more experience than you do. 
Sir, you're making a mistake. 
What happened with President Hassan, and everything else... 
It wasn't Mr. Hastings' fault. 
Chloe, I don't have time to debate this with you. 
Division feels you are the most qualified to step in, and I agree. 
My decision's made. 
Now accept it, and let's move on. 
Does Mr. Hastings know? 
Division's informing him as we speak. 
Just try to make the transition as quick and painless as possible. 
I'll be in touch as soon as the president arrives at the UN. 
Yes, sir. 
Come in. 
Mr. Hastings? 
It's okay, Chloe. 
I just want you to know, I don't think it's fair what they're doing, laying all the blame on you. 
Everything that happens here is my responsibility. 
The successes and the failures. 
I recruited Dana Walsh into this agency, so I let the snake into the garden. 
I need to review protocols with you. 
Let's not waste any time. 
Did you live here long? 
No. Just during my recovery. 
You know, I still think I got some coffee around here. 
What's her name, your granddaughter? 
Teri. 
Kim named her after her mom. 
Jack, listen, I know that we've said a lot of things to each other, and you've made promises to me about... 
I just want you to know that I'm not gonna hold you to them. 
It's been a terrible day, and I know that we-we say things in the moment, and I just... 
I don't want you to... 
Hello? 
Somebody there? 
Take my briefcase to Marine One, and tell the Secret Service I'll be ready to leave shortly. 
And send Mr. Novakovich in. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Mr. Novakovich. 
Thank you for seeing me, Madam President. 
Not at all. 
What can I do for you? 
I just had a curious phone call from Tim Woods indicating that you are intending to move forward with the peace initiative with the IRK. 
That's correct. 
May I ask how you propose to do this, considering their leader is dead? 
Well, I intended to answer that question during my address to the Assembly, but since you're asking... 
Dalia Hassan will be signing the agreement in her husband's stead. 
That's... an interesting idea, 
Madam President, but I don't see how she would have the authority to sign such a document. 
She's getting it from her government now. 
Their parliament called an emergency session to ratify her as provisional president. 
The letter confirming that is forthcoming. 
Madam President, I appreciate your optimism, but I don't understand how you can believe that installing Hassan's widow as some kind of figurehead will alleviate our concerns about the instability of the IRK government. 
With President Hassan dead, the opposition will only get stronger. 
Hassan's death will galvanize his supporters and every advocate of this peace process to endorse her as his successor. 
You can't be certain of that. 
Once again, Mr. Novakovich, 
you're giving every indication that Russia has no interest in this peace accord. 
I'm sorry that you feel that way, Madam President, but the fact remains that we are no longer confident that any meaningful progress can be made. 
Respectfully, my country will be declining to sign your peace document. 
Excuse me. 
Do I need to take this up with President Suvarov myself? 
If you like, but I can assure you, I have full authority on this matter. 
Any decision that I make represents the formal position of the Russian government. 
Good day. 
Agent Peters, I need to see Secretary Kanin now. 
Yes, Madam President. 
Liberty's on the move. 
We managed to clear a blockage in one of your coronary arteries, and the X-rays show the heart muscle damage to be less than we expected. 
In other words, I'm a tough son of a bitch. 
You're a lucky man, I'll say that for you, Mr. Secretary. 
I guess that means I can resume my duties. 
Although the procedure was noninvasive, I'd prefer it if you took it easy for a little while. 
That isn't a no. 
Hello, Ethan. 
How are you feeling? 
Well, uh, I've seen better days. 
Would you give us a few moments, please? 
Thank you. 
You heard about Hassan? 
Tim Woods told me. 
He also filled me in on the IRK plan to install Dalia Hassan. 
What do you think? 
Her family's well connected and powerful. 
I think it's an inspired idea. 
Well, the Russians don't. 
Novakovich told me in no uncertain terms they won't accept her. 
They're using it as an excuse to pull out of the signing. 
Even if the IRK has a new leader, the peace agreement won't stand without Moscow's endorsement. 
I need your help, Ethan. 
You got the Russians to the table. 
What can I do to keep them there? 
There may be someone who can help us here. 
But you're not gonna like it. 
Who? 
Charles Logan. 
Logan? 
Ethan, you can't be serious. 
The man's a criminal. 
I don't care if he was pardoned. 
I didn't agree with President Daniels' decision, either, but the fact is he's left several messages at my office over the past hour. 
Apparently, he's aware of the Russians' reticence in signing the agreement; he's offered his assistance. 
How could he possibly know about this? 
Well, despite his political downfall, he's managed to maintain a uniquely close relationship with Moscow. 
His messages indicated he has information which might prove useful in keeping the Russians at the table. 
What information? 
He didn't say. 
Allison... 
I don't trust this man any more than you do, but I'd be remiss if I didn't urge you to at least... hear him out. 
Okay, listen up, everyone, please. 
I've never been very good at good-byes. 
But I want to tell you what an honor it's been for me to have served with each and every one of you. 
Division is now vetting names to replace me. 
In the meantime, Chloe O'Brian will be in charge, and I'm sure you will show her the same level of loyalty and commitment that you've all shown me. 
Thank you. 
Sir... 
Aw, don't worry, Chloe, you can do this. 
I hope so. 
I just want to say, we had a rough start, but I eventually really enjoyed working for you. 
Well, I'm happy to say that I was wrong about you. 
If I had listened to you in the beginning, maybe things would have turned out differently. 
I doubt it. 
I'll be at Division debriefing. 
But I'm available to you if you have any questions. 
Thank you, sir. 
Good luck. 
Mr. Hastings. 
I have Agent Ortiz on the line. 
They have a situation in Medical. 
This one's all yours, Chloe. 
Ms. O'Brian. 
Cole, it's Chloe. 
Where's Hastings? 
He's not here. 
What happened? 
Samir's just gone into cardiac arrest. 
What? 
I need four milligrams epinephrine and 275 Lidocaine. 
I'll be right there. 
Clear! 
Going again at 360. 
Clear! 
What happened? 
I thought his injuries were not life-threatening. 
So did I. 
Where the hell is Hastings? 
He's been removed by Division. 
Who's in command? 
I am... until they find 
a replacement. 
You were with Samir the whole time? 
All the way from the scene, yeah. 
What about at the scene? 
He may have been out of my sight for a few minutes. 
Emergency personnel were with him. 
Look, we got to move his body to the morgue for an autopsy. 
Not yet... order 
a preliminary toxicology panel. 
But they'll run a full panel during the autopsy. 
I want it done now! 
Chloe, he was barely conscious. 
He couldn't have taken something to off himself. 
No, but somebody could have given it to him. 
Do what she says. 
I'll be in Hastings' office... 
my office. 
Let me know when you find something. 
A few of the more conservative members of our delegation may continue to resist you, but... we can... 
we can persuade them. 
Perhaps if I spoke to them personally. 
A very good idea. 
Miss Kayla, I didn't get a chance to tell you how deeply sorry I am. 
Thank you. 
Well... 
I will see you both back at the U.N. 
The U.N.? 
I thought you were going home. 
No, not yet. 
There are new developments. 
I'll explain them to you on the way. 
What is going on, Mother? 
Why did President Taylor and Jamot want to speak with you alone? 
They have asked me to consider staying on... 
to complete your father's work. 
I don't understand... 
what does that mean? 
Our party wishes to appoint me as the new president. 
What was your answer? 
You told them you couldn't possibly accept, not after what's happened. 
Kayla! 
Our country is on the verge of a coup by the people responsible for the murder of your father. 
Someone must lead. 
You can't beat them, don't you realize that by now? 
I don't believe that; I won't. 
And the greatest blow I can strike against them is to sign the peace agreement. 
This will be your father's legacy. 
It will be a death sentence for you! 
You want peace to live, but all these people want is anarchy. 
Oh, Mother, they'll kill you! 
Enough! 
You are not the only one who has suffered today. 
This was not an easy decision for me, but it was mine to make. 
I do not need you to remind me of the danger. 
I need you to help me be strong. 
Now, pull yourself together... 
there is a car waiting for us. 
Well, I'm sure the media does want a response, but I'm not ready to give them one just yet. 
They'll have to wait. 
All right. 
Thank you. 
The press secretary says the Russians are already leaking to the news channels their intention to "reluctantly" pull out of the talks. 
They don't like wasting time. 
Has my guest arrived? 
Yes, ma'am. 
I had Secret Service bring him in through the freight entrance and then deliver him discreetly to conference room number three, as you asked. 
Thank you, Tim. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Madam President, let me convey my condolences on the loss of President Hassan. 
I know you worked closely with him. 
This must be very hard for you. 
Thank you... for your 
sympathy, Mr. President. 
If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to you alone. 
This is my executive assistant, Jason Pillar. 
I assure you he can be trusted. 
Well, forgive me if I don't give much weight to your endorsement. 
He needs to leave. 
Will you excuse us, Jason? 
Let's get something straight. 
I agreed to this meeting only at the behest of Secretary Kanin. 
Now, I'm not sure you're entirely aware of the situation. 
My understanding is, the Russians are rejecting Dalia Hassan as a legitimate successor, and as a result, won't sign off on the peace agreement. 
You're well informed. 
I have close friends in Moscow. 
In some ways, people there appreciate me more than people in my own country. 
It wasn't their constitution you trampled. 
The Russians have been trying to back out of this agreement from day one. 
Do you honestly think your relationships can change their minds? 
I'm certain I can. 
How? 
Let's just say I'm going to be able to exercise some leverage. 
What kind of leverage? 
If it gets the job done, does it really matter? 
It does to me. 
I can promise you no laws'll be broken, nothing will tarnish you or your presidency, but the details really must stay between me and the Russians. 
You and President Hassan created the framework for the most significant peace in a generation, and you got the entire world behind it. 
To let the Russians tear down what should be the crown jewel in your administration... 
Don't play me. 
This is about you trying to repair your reputation. 
Is that so hard to understand? 
You participated in a conspiracy to cover up the assassination of David Palmer. 
I was trying to protect the country from an unnecessary trauma... 
Don't! You were 
doing what was best for yourself. 
Yes. 
You're right, Madam President. 
You're right. 
I suppose I've spent so many years trying to justify my actions that it's become difficult for me... 
to own up to the truth. 
I made mistakes, terrible mistakes, that stained the office of the presidency... 
and for which I will be paying the rest of my life. 
But I still can be of value to my country. 
I can still do some good. 
Look, we both know you wouldn't have called me unless you were out of options, so we can continue to dwell on the past, or you can let me pursue the only chance you have of resurrecting the peace process. 
Please. 
Let me help you. 
All right. 
Thank you. 
What do you intend to do first? 
Arrange a meeting with the Russian delegate Novakovich. 
Uh, get a message to him at his hotel. 
Tell him that you are sending over your official emissary to have a talk with him. 
What if he doesn't agree to this meeting? 
Make sure he knows it's me. 
He'll agree to it. 
God help you if you make me regret this. 
O'Brian. 
You okay? 
Perfect. 
Promise? 
Hmm. 
I am so thirsty. 
Me, too. 
Do you want me to get you something to drink? 
Okay. 
I'll be right back. 
Don't move. 
Jack, your cell's ringing. 
Don't worry about it, let it go. 
Hello. 
Jack's phone. 
Renee, it's Chloe. 
I need to talk to Jack. 
What's wrong? 
Samir Mehran is dead. 
I think he was assassinated. 
What do you mean, assassinated? 
I ran a preliminary toxicology report. 
It showed traces of an unidentified toxin in his bloodstream. 
Someone must have injected him with it, probably at the scene. 
There was, there was an EMT there. 
He looked familiar. 
There was so much going on, I-I didn't take much notice. 
Familiar? From where? 
I need you to get my FBI case files. 
Get me everything you have on Red Square. 
You think he was from the Russian Mob? 
He looked like somebody who was with Vladimir Laitanan during the time I was under. 
That was six years ago. 
Are you sure? 
Honestly, no. 
Just send me the case files, all the surveillance photos that were taken, and I'll see if he's in there. 
Okay. 
Jack... 
you need to hear this. 
Samir... 
Renee... 
Renee! 
Renee? 
Come on. Come on. 
Jack. 
Renee, are you there? 
Jack. 
Don't talk, I'm gonna get you to a hospital. 
Did something happen? 
Who is this? 
It's Chloe. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Renee's been hit by a sniper through the window of my apartment. 
We're still taking fire. 
I need a trauma team at St. Andrew's now. 
Hold on, stay with me. 
Come on. 
Let's go. 
Keep everybody in the lobby. 
There's a sniper outside. 
Call 911. 
Now! 
Move! 
She's been shot; We need to get to the hospital... 
St. Andrew's Hospital, 
22nd and Ninth. 
Come on, you can make it. 
Wait... just wait... 
We're gonna make it. 
We're gonna make it, I promise. 
Do whatever you have to! 
We've got to get to the hospital now! 
Come on, come on. 
I got you, I got you. 
I got you. 
You'll be all right. 
We're almost there. 
They're a few blocks from your hospital and should be there any minute. 
Please make sure she's given priority care. 
Thank you. 
Arlo, pull up satellite. 
Isolate the areas between Eighth Avenue and West 18th Street. 
What's going on? 
Renee Walker was just shot. 
What?! 
Just do what I asked. 
Jack said the sniper was positioned at his apartment at 1145 West 18th Street. 
Roll back the feed three minutes. 
Is she gonna be okay? 
He's rushing her to the hospital now. 
I don't get it. 
Why would anyone want to kill Renee? 
Help! She's been shot! 
There's no exit wound! 
We got a gunshot wound to the chest... let's move. 
What's her pulse? 
110, respiratory is still ragged. 
Check her carotid. 
BP is 80 over 50. 
Right here. 
What do we have? 
Five is prepped. 
We're gonna take care of you. 
O.R. five, let's go. 
How many gunshot wounds? 
One in the chest. 
Sir, you need to stay right here. 
Is patient typing crossed? 
No. 
Call the blood bank, send up four units of O-negative. 
 Right away. 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
Yeah. 
Jack, it's Chloe. 
How is she? 
Not good. 
We rolled back satellite to the area around your building. 
The shots were fired from an office across the street. 
PD reported finding a body at the scene. 
What about the shooter? 
We don't have anything. 
We lost him. 
You were on the phone with her right before she got shot. 
What were you talking about? 
It's not important right now. 
Just... 
be with her. 
She's in surgery, Chloe, I can't. 
What were you talking about? 
I told her what I'm calling to tell you. 
Samir Mehran was given a lethal injection at the scene of his capture, probably to keep him from talking. 
Renee thought she may have recognized one of the EMTs. 
She didn't say anything to me. 
She wasn't sure. 
She didn't think it meant anything at the time. 
Where did she say she remembered him from? 
From her days undercover with the Russian Mob. 
She asked me to get her the Red Square file. 
Did you pull up the file? 
Yes. 
Jack? 
I gotta get back to you. 
I'm sorry, she didn't make it. 
There was just too much arterial damage and blood loss. 
I'm very sorry. 
Transcript By Addic7ed.com 
Listen, I've been thinking a lot about what we talked about. 
I want to move back to Los Angeles with you. 
Really? 
Yeah. 
You're coming with us tonight? 
If it's okay. 
Dad, I don't know what to say. 
I'm so happy! 
Victor, what are you doing here? 
How the hell did you find me? 
I have information. I'm out. 
I don't work for the government anymore. 
Well, this you're gonna want to hear. 
There's a big hit going down. 
President Hassan at the UN, he's getting taken out. 
When? Today, 
before he can sign this thing with Taylor. 
My country agrees to abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons. 
But our terms, Mr. President, 
were that the inspectors themselves would be American, not IAEA. 
This is the message that you send to the rest of the world, and then you wonder why we don't want to negotiate! 
Farhad. 
Please excuse my brother's passion. 
We need to resolve this issue before we can move forward. 
Find a way to give him what he wants. 
This man is a once-in-a-lifetime leader. 
I'm, uh, stuck outside. 
I'll take care of it. 
This woman poses no threat to me or the peace process. 
But you are married. 
I've done nothing reckless. 
Just reinstate Ms. Reed's clearance now. 
Unless you want to destroy everything that he's worked for, stay away from him. 
The brother revoked my clearance, but I had Hassan reinstate it. 
I know I'm behind schedule, but it'll get done. 
Excuse me, Mr. Hastings. 
Jack Bauer's on line three. 
He needs to talk to you. 
Bauer? 
I'm with an informant that I used to run who's claiming he's got intel on an assassination attempt on President Hassan. 
And what does Mr. Aruz want 
in return for his information? 
CTU protection and immunity. 
I'll send a chopper to pick you up. 
Don't stop for anything! Keep going! 
(gasps) You need to get him out of here! 
He's losing a lot of blood! 
Hastings wants to debrief you back at CTU. 
I'm not going back to CTU. 
I delivered him, I'm done. 
No, Mr. Bauer... 
I got a flight to catch. 
That's it? 
Get down! 
Tell me what you know. 
The hitter has someone on the inside... 
close to Hassan. 
(siren wailing) It's done. Aruz is no longer a problem. 
But we don't know how much he told CTU. 
We need to accelerate the hit. 
(phone rings) Sir, Agent Ortiz is calling in. 
HASTINGS: Put him through. 
I want everyone on this. 
Comm channel 235. All right, go ahead. 
This is Cole. Where are those EMTs? 
They should be there any second. 
How's the rest of your team? 
Earley's injured. 
Torres and Johnson are dead. 
What happened? Look, those drones 
are supposed to have antiballistics. 
Why didn't they take out the missile? 
We're still running the diagnostic. 
Sir, this should've never happened! 
We should've had another team checking those buildings! 
We can discuss this at a later time, Agent Ortiz. 
Yes, sir. 
Bauer wants to talk with you. 
Put him on the phone. 
Stand by. 
Jack, I have Mr. Hastings on the line. 
Mr. Hastings? 
Victor Aruz told me right before he died that the assassin is working with someone very close to President Hassan. 
Did you get a name? 
No, not before he died. 
You believe him? Normally, 
I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him. 
He was dying, sir. 
He had no reason to lie. 
All right. We're on it. 
I need you and Cole back here to debrief. 
Mr. Hastings, I already gave one 
of your agents my statement. 
I need you back here. 
Yeah... Mr. Bauer? 
Fine. We're on our way. 
Mr. Hastings. 
Yes? 
I may have a lead on that insider. 
What do you mean? I just picked up 
an unauthorized access in one of the secure databases at the UN. 
How do you know it's unauthorized? 
Because they bypassed the main access page and went through a back-end server. 
The only reason to do that is if you're trying to cover your tracks. 
Stay on it. Let me know 
if you trace the source. 
And put O'Brian on this, too, if you don't think she'll slow you down. 
No. She's doing much better, sir. 
I'm gonna call Taylor's chief of staff. 
They need to know this insider could be moving against Hassan. 
Mr. President, you are under a 
great deal of pressure at home from an active opposition to this peace agreement. 
They believe that by dismantling your nuclear weapons programs, you're surrendering to the West. 
How do you respond to those charges? 
The only thing we are surrendering is the cloud of antagonism and mistrust under which we have lived for far too long. 
This is a victory for my people. 
It marks an end to isolation and will bring economic stability to my country for the first time in decades. (phone buzzes) 
(reporters clamoring) How do you propose economic stability when your people are so divided? 
This is Weiss. Did you bring in Victor Aruz? 
I'm afraid not, sir. 
There was an ambush, and Aruz was killed, along with two of our men. 
Damn it. 
Before Aruz died, he shared some very troubling information. 
Now, he claimed that someone close to President Hassan has been conspiring with the assassin. 
Now, we don't have a name yet, but we are pursuing a lead. 
Tell me how, and I'd better be impressed. 
We're tracing what might be an unauthorized entry into one of the UN servers. 
And you think this is the person we're looking for? 
Well, we're optimistic. 
Yeah, you better hope that optimism translates into results. 
Sir, until we locate the insider, you might want to consider locking down President Hassan and postponing this conference. 
That is not an option, Mr. Hastings. 
We are close to signing one of the most important treaties in the history of this country. 
You were put in charge of CTU because you said you could get the job done. 
"Lean, mean and fast," that's what you said. 
President Taylor expects you to deliver on those words. 
Yes, sir. 
I'll take this to the president. 
Keep me posted. 
TAYLOR: President Hassan and I still have a great deal of work to do, so we're gonna wrap this up, but I would like to say that the president and I chose the United Nations as the venue for these talks because the problems facing the Middle East have become a world concern. 
And President Hassan and I are confident that this agreement will lay the foundation for a lasting peace in the region. 
And we thank you for your time. Thank you. 
(reporters clamoring) TAYLOR: Mr. President, 
I'll see you after the break. 
I look forward to resuming it. 
Thank you. 
Madam President, I just spoke with CTU. 
There's been a development regarding the threat to Hassan. 
We need to speak in private. 
That is really wonderful. 
Thank you. I'll join you later. 
Hello. 
You were terrific. 
(chuckles) It's not about me, it's the message that's important. 
I just hope no one could see how nervous I was. 
(chuckles) Well, you hid it well. 
Are you here? 
Yes, on my way up. 
Do you still have time to see me? 
I've been looking forward to it all day. 
When? 
What did you say? 
When can I see you? 
I've got half an hour before the next session begins. 
You meet me now, and we'll go up to my private office together. 
I'll tell my staff that you requested an interview Perfect. I'll be right there. 
I just ran a systems check on the drone. 
Sensors did pick up the missile, but the drone didn't fire. 
Why not? 
I won't know until I have a chance to take it apart. 
Mr. Hastings, 
I don't want to sound like I'm covering my own ass. 
but I did tell you that the antimissile system had not been tested in an urban environment. 
I know what you said, Arlo. 
You just find out what went wrong and you get back to me. 
Mr. Hastings, I was right. 
Someone hacked into the UN database. 
They downloaded security protocols, the schematics to the UN and Hassan's personal itinerary. 
I was able to trace an IP address. 
Did you get a name? 
Chloe's into the computer's registry. 
She should have it by now. 
Almost there. Come on, Chloe. 
Saying that isn't gonna make it happen any faster. 
There, the computer's owner is listed as Meredith Michelle Reed. 
She's a reporter working for the New York Courier. 
She's doing a profile on Hassan. 
Applied for a security clearance at the UN. 
Did she get it? 
My God... What? 
She's there now. 
UN Security logged her in 15 minutes ago. 
She's at the press conference. 
Put me through to UN Security. 
(device beeps) You're clear. Go ahead. 
Thank you. 
Okay, go ahead. 
This is Brian Hastings, director of CTU. 
We have a possible o n-site threat to President Hassan. 
Do you have an ID? 
Her name is Meredith Reed. 
She has a press security clearance. 
We're sending a photograph to your PDA. 
We just got a call about a threat to President Hassan. 
The UN gave us access to their surveillance feed. 
Facial recognition software is sweeping the area now. 
Got a match. 
Northeast corner, moving toward Hassan. 
Located the suspect. 
She's ten yards from Hassan, east side of the press section. 
Green top, black skirt, black jacket! 
There she is. Go, go, go, go, go, go! 
Everybody, move back! 
Move back! What are you doing? 
(clamoring) I'm a reporter. 
I have clearance. 
Move back! 
HASSAN: Meredith? 
I'm a journalist! I'm a journalist. 
I have credentials. 
We got a call from CTU about a threat to your life. 
Keep moving, keep moving. 
(clamoring) Mr. President... 
Come on! 
You're making a mistake. 
The suspect's name is Meredith Reed. 
She's a journalist profiling Hassan. 
Now, our operating theory is that she's been using her access to gain security intel, which she's been feeding to the assassin. 
Ms. Reed is being transported 
back here right now. 
My hope is that she will give us the name of the assassin so that we can put an end to this threat. 
Refer to your digital briefing packets for specifics. 
Mr. Hastings, I just received a 
preliminary report from the team sweeping Ms. Reed's apartment. 
And? 
They recovered the files stolen from the UN database off her laptop. 
It looks like we found our insider. 
They also found a large file that couldn't be opened. 
It's been encrypted with intelligence grade software. 
HASTINGS: I want you to find out what's inside that file. 
It's on its way over as we speak. Good. 
Excuse me, does anyone think this happened a little too fast and a little too easily? 
You know, Chloe, things do happen a little faster in here than what you're used to. 
I know, you keep reminding me. 
I might not be up to speed on all your software, but I know if someone doesn't want to be found, they don't leave behind code fragments that could lead to an I.P. 
address. Unless, of course, 
they were in a hurry and they had to improvise. 
Maybe, but then why would you go through all that trouble and leave a huge red flag for everyone to find? 
What is your point? 
It's like someone wanted us to find her. 
I just think we should continue to vet this until we're sure that we have the right person. 
We are vetting this from every angle. 
I appreciate your concerns. 
We'll keep them in mind. 
In other words, "Shut up, Chloe." 
That's not what he said. 
Well, that's what I heard. 
All right, you made your point. 
Chloe, thanks. 
All right, one last thing. 
Ms. Reed has spent a lot of time 
on assignment in the Middle East. 
I want to cross-check all of her movements with those of known terrorist groups. 
Let's get moving. 
Chloe. 
Jack Bauer should be here any second. 
I want you to handle his debrief. 
You're taking me off the floor? 
I think you'll be better utilized debriefing Mr. Bauer. 
Go set up. 
Thank you, sir. 
(tires squealing) I'm walking in now. 
Give me the home phone numbers for Torres and Johnson. 
Nobody speaks to their wives before me. 
Cole, before you make your report, I want you to keep someing in md. 
What's that? 
I know you asked for more boots on the ground, but what happened happened. 
There's nothing we can do about that. 
You put your opinion on record, it's going to flag an internal review from division. 
It's only going to hurt us moving forward. 
We're clear. 
Mr. Bauer, Brian Hastings. 
Sorry about the loss of your men. 
Thank you. You'll be glad 
to know the lead you got from Victor Aruz panned out. 
You telling me that you've already found the insider? 
Her name's Meredith Reed. She's a 
journalist who was covering the peace conference. 
She was stealing files off the UN servers. 
Now, we wouldn't have gotten this far without your help. 
Thank you. 
Now, Chloe O'Brian's waiting to debrief you. 
Shouldn't take long. 
I just need to make a phone call first. 
Excuse me. 
(phone dialing) We need to be on the same page here. 
I think you can understand that. 
Sir, you're asking me to lie on the record. 
I'm asking you to exercise some discretion. 
There's an assassin out there. 
We don't need people secon d-guessing how we do things. 
Well, maybe you'd like to debrief for me. 
(phone line ringing) (phone ringing) All right, let's get you in here. 
Hello. 
Hey, sweetheart, it's me. 
Hey, where are you? 
CTU. 
CTU? Does this have anythingo do 
with what's going on at the UN? 
Yes, but I promise I won't be long. 
I just need to give them a statement. 
But I'm going to have to meet you at the airport. 
Dad, what's going on? 
It's complicated. 
I'll explain when I see you. 
Okay, but we're coming there to pick you up. 
Sweetheart, you don't need to do that. 
I want to. It's on the way. 
Okay, I'll have Chloe get you a security pass. 
I'll see you soon. Bye. 
Who was that? 
My father. 
Everything all right? 
I'm not sure. 
HASTINGS: Everyone said you were too young, and inexperienced to head up field ops, but I believed you could do the job. 
Now I need you to show the same faith in me that I showed in you. 
Keep our little dispute off the record. 
Where's Chloe? 
She's upstairs. First room to the right. 
Thank you. 
Think about what I said. 
Hey. 
Hey, Jack. 
Sorry, but we got to do this kind of quick. 
I guess you heard about the reporter they arrested. 
Yeah. Well, I think we might 
have the wrong person. 
Meredith Reed could be innocent. 
Hastings said they found evidence on her computer. 
I know, but I think those files may have been planted. 
Look, I've been scanning through the trafc cam footage from outside Meredith Reed's apartment building. 
Five minutes before the intrusion to the UN server, this man was going into the service entrance of the building. 
Ten minutes later, he left. 
What if he went into her apartment and used her laptop to break into the servers? 
Sounds a little thin. 
Don't you think we found her kind of fast, and that it was a little too easy? 
Why are you showing me this? 
Why don't you just take it to Hastings? 
Hastings doesn't think I know what I'm doing. 
He won't listen to me. 
He might listen to you. 
Chloe, I'm here for my debrief. 
Kim's on her way. 
I'm leaving on a plane to Los Angeles with my family in an hour. 
I'm just asking you to talk to him. 
It'll take ten minutes. 
If the assassin framed Reed to create a diversio that means we have the wrong person in custody. 
That he still has someone inside Hassan's delegation. 
I'm sorry, Chloe, it's not my problem. 
Please, let's just continue with the debrief. 
NEWSCASTER: Nor will they confirm any fatalities. 
There is no evidence at this time to support the theory that the two incidents are related. 
We're still waiting for an official statement as to why this reporter was arrested. 
At this time we can confirm that her name is Meredith Reed... 
I'm so gd you're all right. 
I can't believe this happened. 
...has yet to comment. In other news... 
It's hard to believe, Kayla. 
I just don't understand how this woman got so close to you. 
She's a journalist. 
She had security clearance. 
Do all reporters get these clearances? 
No, but she's writing an article on me. 
You know that, Dalia. 
She was given special access. 
You gave her that access? 
Yes, I did. I did it. 
This article was important for me. 
I wanted to get my message across to the American public. 
That's the only reason? 
Yes, that's the only reason! 
What other reason? 
If you have something to say, then say it. 
You should never have let her into our lives. 
You put us all in danger. 
(knock at door) Please, stop. 
Excuse me. 
I just spoke to the UN press director. 
We're going to make a public statement. 
Make sure I see it first. 
Omar, may I speak with you alone? 
Excuse us. 
They've taken Meredith Reed to CTU. 
I can't believe she's part of this. 
What reason could she have to help someone kill me? 
What reason does any American have to do anything? Money. 
They found incriminating files on her computer, Omar. 
Whether you want to believe it or not, she is guilty. 
And she's going to talk. 
I need to know what she's going to tell them about your relationship. 
Be honest with me. 
Tell me everything. 
It started three months ago in B'Dar. 
We met for an interview in her hotel room. 
Dalia and I had been fighting that day. 
She used you, Omar. 
She almost cost you your life. 
And if this affair becomes public, it will destroy your credibility and everything that you've worked for. 
I don't need you to tell me the consequences. 
If she talks to the Americans, you must deny it. 
It never happened. 
Look, Omar, I know you're thinking you must do the honorable thing and confess the truth. 
That would be a terrible mistake. 
I need to be with my family. 
DAVROS: Yes? 
I just spoke with my brother. 
I told him to deny the affair. 
What did he say? 
He's going to consider it. 
Press him harder. 
The reporter's claims need to be discredited. 
CTU needs to continue to think she's my contact on the inside. 
I understand. 
We only need another hour. 
I'll be ready to move by then. 
Arlo. Hey. 
I need your help decrypting that file they found on Reed's computer. 
I broke off a section. 
It should be on your screen. 
What filter do you want me to run it through? 
Esquire Nine. 
No problem. 
And, Arlo you can stop staring at my breasts now. 
So when are you going to drop Captain America and find yourself a real man? 
I'm still thinking about it. 
Well, don't take too long. 
I might lose interest. 
(phone ringing) Let me know what you find. 
Dana Walsh. 
Hello? 
Dana Walsh. 
I like that. 
You picked a good name for yourself. 
That's actually better than the one your mama picked for you. 
Whoever this is, I told you to stop calling me. 
Yeah, I know what you told me, Jenny. 
My name is not Jenny. 
You must be mistaking me for someone else. 
Oh, am I? 
Yes. 
That's funny. 
'Cause you sound a lot like this girl I used to know from Rock Springs named Jenny Scott. 
She was a wild thing, man. 
We used to do some crazy stuff. 
The next time you call me, I promise you I will contact the police. 
Yeah? You know, I got a better idea. 
Let's contact them right now. 
I'm hanging up now. 
Hey, don't hang up this phone. 
I'm warning you, Jenny, do not... 
Hey. 
Hey. 
Whoa. 
I was just going to look for you. 
I'm so glad that you're okay. 
I'm sorry that I have been so distant lately. 
It's just... 
I don't ever want to lose you. 
Don't worry. 
Why am I here? This is a mistake. 
Damn it. Who's in charge here? 
Tell Mr. Weiss there's nothing yet. 
But I'll call him as soon as we have news. Thanks. 
Brian Hastings, director of CTU. 
Look, I don't know who the hell you people think you are. 
But I want an attorney, and I demand to know what I'm being charged with. 
We found the files, Ms. Reed. 
What files? 
On your computer. In your apartment. 
You searched my apartment? 
We found six documents on your laptop that were stolen from the UN servers. 
What documents? 
Relating to the security arrangements for the peace conference. 
You're here because we know that you're part of a plan to assassinate President Hassan. 
What? What? 
Please don't waste my time. 
The evidence against you is clear-cut. 
No, no, no. Listen to me. 
You're making a mistake. 
If there are files on my computer, then someone put them there. 
HASTINGS: Now you listen to me. 
I'm giving you a chance to help yourself by telling us what you know. 
I need the name of the assassin, how to find them. 
And we talk about you avoiding the death penalty. 
You're wrong. 
You've got the wrong person. 
Take her to interrogation. 
Full biometric package. 
I'll be there shortly. 
MAN: This way, ma'am. 
Mr. Hastings? 
You're done with your debrief? 
Yeah. Can I talk to you? 
Not a good time, Mr. Bauer. 
Meredith Reed might be telling you the truth. 
Is this coming from O'Brian? 
I told her to drop this. 
Yeah, well, she didn't. 
She found this. They were 
taken from traffic cams near Ms. Reed's apartment. 
Check out the time stamps. 
It shows this man entering the building through the service entrance almost five minutes before the intrusion into the UN servers. 
It shows him leaving the building almost immediately after. So? 
Chloe talked to the building manager. 
There was no scheduled maintenance today, no packages delivered. 
And this is your evidence? 
I'm looking at an apartment building, where dozens of people live, coming and going all day long. 
Look, I understand. All I'm saying is that 
it is possible that someone broke into the apartment and used her computer to steal the documents. 
All you need to do is send a couple agents to check it out. 
I'm sorry, I just don't see it. 
And I can't waste valuable resources because Chloe O'Brian has a theory. 
Chloe and I have worked together for a long time. 
And trust me. She's someone 
you might want to listen to. 
She's very good at what she does. 
And if she's right, the assassin's got you looking in the wrong place, and you will get bit. 
Mr. Bauer, I have a suspect in hand 
with a file she felt damning enough to encrypt. 
That's where I'm going to focus my resources. 
Now, if you will excuse me. 
I hate this place. 
He's not going to help, is he? 
We have to follow this lead. 
If they have the wrong person... 
Chloe, I did what you asked. 
I talked to Hastings. 
If he doesn't want to listen, that's his mistake. 
But it's not my problem. 
To be honest with you, it's not yours, either. 
What about the threat against Hassan? 
What about the peace conference? 
Doesn't any of that matter to you? 
What if Hastings knows something you don't? 
Look, I'm sorry. 
Kim's waiting for me outside. 
I've got to go. 
Jack! 
You've come to me for help many times, and I've never let you down. 
You've asked me to do crazy things, and I've always taken your side. 
Please help me. 
I can't do this by myself. 
I'm sorry. 
I-I can't. 
Not this time. Not me. 
Hey. 
Look what I made! 
Let me see. 
That's Daddy. That's Mommy. 
And that's me and that's you. 
See? That's you, Grandpa. 
It's beautiful, sweetheart. 
Dad, we need to talk. 
Yeah. Here, honey. 
Why don't you get Daddy to put you in the car seat? 
We're ready to go. 
What's wrong? 
I spoke to Chloe. 
She told me what's happening. 
Chloe called you? 
No, I called her because you wouldn't tell me what was going on, so I decided to find out for myself. 
I know about the threat to the peace conference, that CTU might have the wrong suspect. 
What's happening? 
Chloe had me make her case to the head of CTU. 
He wasn't convinced, and he thinks he's got the right person. 
But if he's wrong, then there's still someone inside the UN who's working with this assassin? 
That's what Chloe thinks. 
What do you think? 
I think it's not my problem. 
Dad! What? 
I don't believe you. 
I've never known you to walk away from something like this. 
If you have to stay, it's all right. 
You're not letting me down. 
I understand. 
Sweetheart, I want to go with you. 
I know you do. 
And there's nothing I want more than for you to come with us. 
I have been waiting so long for this day. 
We both have. 
But if something terrible happens, and you could have done something to stop it, I don't think you'd be able to live with yourself. 
Dad, it's okay. You can go. 
As soon as I'm finished here, I will get on a plane and I will be in Los Angeles, I promise. 
Just be careful, please. 
Come here. 
I will. 
I should tell Teri. 
No, no. Let me do it. 
Go ahead. 
Go. 
Okay. 
Go on. 
You okay? 
Yeah, I'm fine, but we should go. 
Sweetie... 
Grandpa has some work to do. 
He can't fly with us. 
But he'll come as soon as he can. 
But he said he was coming today. 
No, not today. 
But soon, okay? 
All right, let's go. 
Jack... 
We need to find out where your suspect went after he left Miss Reed's apartment. 
Start checking traffic cams. 
Okay. I need to get a baseline 
on her respiratory, cardio and dermal response, so make her comfortable. 
Start off with a few softball questions. 
Miss Reed, I think we need a fresh start. 
Now, you claim those files were planted on your computer. 
Fine. I'm willing to give you 
the benefit of the doubt, but you need to meet me halfway. Talk to me. 
Help me understand your side of the story. 
Fair enough? 
, when was the first time you met President Hassan? 
(clears throat) About six months ago. 
At a conference of oil ministers. 
I requested an interview, and he agreed. 
We met in his hotel lobby twice. 
Hour, hour and a half, at the most. 
(elevator bell dings) Madam President. 
Mr. President. 
I want to thank you for wanting to continue our negotiations. 
I know it's a risk. 
Madam President, you are no stranger to making personal sacrifices for your beliefs. 
If the price for peace is my lif so be it. 
Now, we are doing everything in our power to make sure that that doesn't happen. 
We've tightened security measures here, and CTU's top priority is to find the people who are targeting you. 
I appreciate that. 
Madam President, the woman you took into custody... 
The reporter. Meredith Reed. 
Yes. Is CTU certain that 
she is part of this plan? 
Well, from what I understand, the evidence against her is quite incriminating. 
Have they found out her reasons? 
Well, Miss Reed is being questioned as we speak. 
I'll make sure whatever information we get from her will be shared with your people as soon as possible. 
Jack, I've searched through all the traffic cams within a five-block radius of Meredith Reed's apartment. 
There's no sign of where the suspect went. 
Can you check other sources? 
CTU has drones all over the city. 
I could look through their archives and see if they picked anything up. 
Where are they? 
The archives are in Arlo's station. 
I don't have the clearance. 
Can you hack in? 
Yeah. 
Do it. 
I'm glad you're here. Thanks for staying. 
Yeah. 
This will all be over soon and you can get to California. 
Okay. I'm in. 
One of the drones picked him up leaving Reed's apartment. 
Play it forward. 
Well, he hailed a cab when he left. 
JACK: Can you track the cab? 
No. It's beyond the drone's search grid. 
Okay, back it up. 
Stop. 
Move in closer. 
ere, that's what I want to see. 
Closer. 
See the medallion? 
Call t cab company, find out where it went. 
I'm not tracking this guy without a weapon. 
The Armory's on Level C. 
I have to input your palm print through the hand scanner. 
Erase this as soon as I'm clear. 
(beeping) I'll call you as soon as I'm on e road. 
(dialing phone) (phone ringing) Hello? 
Ruth, it's me. Jenny? 
I need to talk to you, are you alone? 
Uh, just my kid. What's going on? 
Haven't heard from you since Christmas. 
Kevin Wade found me. 
He's been calling me at work the last two days. 
Damn it, Ruth, you told him how to find me? 
No, I didn't! 
You're the only one who knows the truth. 
The only one who knows where I am. 
I swear, I never talked to Kevin. 
I didn't even know he was out of jail. 
Then how did he find me? 
I don't know! 
Okay. 
And what does he want, anyway? Why is he calling you? 
He didn't say. 
But he's threatening to tell everyone the truth about me. 
It'll destroy my career. 
I'm about to get married, Ruth. 
To a really great guy. 
Well, there's gotta be something you can do. 
You can't let this son of a bitch just ruin your life. 
I don't know what to do. 
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose everything. 
I gotta go, I'll call you later. 
Where you been? 
I've been trying to find you. 
Did you decrypt the file? No. 
I'm still working on it. 
I found something weird, though. 
Someone hacked into my station and it came from inside CTU. 
What were they doing? 
Scanning the drone archives. 
Track it down, see who it was. 
And when you were in B'Dar, profiling President Hassan, were you ever approached by anyone who was hostile to his regime? 
No. No one paid you? 
No. Pressured you into cooperating? 
I said no. 
So all you did was interview President Hassan, that's it? 
Yes, that's all. 
Her answer prompted a leve l-five autonomic reaction. 
You're lying, Ms. Reed. 
I'm not. I... 
Tell me what really happened in B'Dar! 
How is it connected to the assassination plot? 
I don't have anything to do with any plan to assassinate President Hassan. 
My God, why would I? 
Your reasons are irrelevant. 
All I care about is stopping the assassin. 
So do I. 
So if someone really is trying to kill Hassan, you need to stop wasting your time on me and find them. 
(doorbell ringing) Hey, Mike, what's going on? 
Maggie, I-I'm so sorry for dropping by without calling first. 
Mind if I come in? 
Sure, come on. Thanks. 
Did, uh, Jim leave for work yet? 
No, just got or. Oh, good. 
'Cause I need to ask him something before he leaves. 
Kind of a favor. Okay. 
Hey, babe? 
KOENIG: Yeah? Mike Farmer's here. 
Says he needs to talk to you. 
Mikey! Hey! 
What are you doing here? You're not on shift 
till tomorrow. Yeah, that's what 
I wanted to talk to you about. 
All right, I'll be right down. 
All right, take your time. 
Want coffee? Sure. 
Come on. NEWSMAN:... 
during President Taylor's press conference earlier this afternoon. 
NEWSWOMAN: I wouldn't want to speculate at this time, Bob, but as you know, President Taylor's peace negotiations with IRK president Omar Hassan are highly controversial... 
Sit down. Thanks. 
...and are causing much political 
dissent both in... (sighs) 
Did you hear anything more about what happened at that press conference? 
No, only what they're saying on TV. 
I gotta tell you, I'm so proud of you and Jim and all those boys down at the precinct. 
I mean, you're gonna be part of history. 
Nah, I don't know. 
We're just directing traffic, really. 
You're on the UN security detail. 
That's more than directing traffic. 
Ahh... Hell, you might even get on TV. 
Wow, yeah, wouldn't that be something. 
Yeah, it would! 
Right. 
(both chuckling) (monitors beeping) I need to speak with Mr. Hastings. 
Uh, we're in session. It's important. 
Excuse me, Mr. Hastings, 
I have Dana Walsh out here. 
She says it's important. 
You're not leaving this room until you tell me the truth. 
No matter how long it takes. 
I'm sorry to bother you, sir, but I didn't think that this could wait. 
What's this about? 
Jack Bauer. 
Come on... 
(beeping) (lock clicks, buzzes) (phone ringing) Yeah? 
I spoke with the dispatcher at the cab company. 
His driver logged the dro p-off at West 23rd Street at the northwest corner of Broadway in Queens. 
Anything more specific? 
An apartment number, an address? 
Not from the dispatcher, but I'll keep sifting through the aerial footage. 
Okay, Broadway and West 23rd. 
I'll call you when I get there. 
Hands in the air! Now! 
Against the wall! 
Don't move. 
He had this, sir. 
We'll take it from here. AGENT: Stand down. 
I told you to leave this alone. 
Chloe tracked the man in the surveillance photo to a second location. 
We didn't think you'd follow through with an investigation. 
So you had no choice except to steal weapons from the armory. 
Would you have followed through with an investigation if I'd asked? 
I'm not debating this anymore. 
You shut down a lead before you could even assess whether it was good or bad. 
Take him to detention. 
Take him! 
COLE: Let's go. 
I'm sure President Taylor's gonna be very interested to find out what happened to my informant when I tried to deliver him to you. Excuse me? 
Cole tried to secure that landing zone with more men, but instead you sent a drone, which failed to detect the missile that killed my informant and two of your men. 
Cole hasn't said anything about it. 
And neither will I, as long as you let me pursue this. 
So now you're blackmailing me? 
You forced my hand, now I'm forcing yours. 
You don't want to be doing this, Bauer. No, I don't. 
I wanna be on a plane to Los Angeles with my family. 
But you're not giving me another choice. 
You want to waste your time chasing ghosts? 
Knock yourself out. 
I've got to stop an assassination plot. 
Give him the bag. 
I need Chloe to run Ops. 
Fine, she's all yours. 
Thank you. 
Anything to what he's talking about? 
The only viable lead is sitting in our interrogation room. 
And she's the only way we're going to get to the assassin. 
What's going on, Mikey? 
Hey, listen, um, something came up. 
I can't make my shift tomorrow. 
So, I was wondering if we could swap. 
Oh, I'd be happy to, except Maggie and me have a meeting with Sean's teacher tomorrow. 
She said he's acting out in class, but I don't believe it. 
Jim keeps making excuses for him, but if he needs help, I want to give it to him. 
Where is he? He's at his grandma's tonight. 
I'm not making excuses. 
So, what are you saying? 
You can't trade shifts with me? 
This is kind of important, so I'm sorry. 
(sighing): Yeah. 
Me, too. 
Whoa, Mikey, what... 
Maggie, I want you to sit down. 
Jim, there's a roll of tape in my bag. 
Tear off a strip and put it over Maggie's mouth. 
Do it. 
(Maggie panting) I'm sorry, baby. Oh, my God. 
Now, pick up the phone, call Captain Ravello. 
Tell him you're sick and I'm filling in for you. 
Now, listen, you son of a bitch, there's no way... 
Oh! Oh, what's the matter 
with you?! (sobbing) 
What are you doing?! 
Next time, I won't miss the bone. 
(Maggie sobbing) Make the call. 
All right. 
All right, I'll call. 
Please, just leave my wife alone, all right? 
﻿1 Sir, we just found this among Meredith Reed's personal effects. 
It's a dedicated key card, United Nations issue. 
To who? President Hassan and his family. 
It accesses their private residence. 
 We got her. 
I want to know where you got it. 
Omar gave it to me. 
I gave Miss Reed this key card for reasons I'm sure are clear to you. 
Sir, are you confirming a romantic involvement with Meredith Reed? 
I trust your complete discretion in this matter. 
We have a problem. 
My brother confessed to the affair. 
I don't know if the frame's going to hold. 
 There is no reason to diverge from the plan. 
How much longer? 
Your brother will be dead before the hour is out. 
What are you doing here? 
I thought I told you to leave me alone. 
CTU. 
Senior Data Analyst. 
Well, sounds like an important job. 
Damn it, what do you want from me?! 
A place to crash, for starters. 
You can stay the night. 
I want you out tomorrow. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we're evacuating immediately, due to a possible bomb threat. 
Madam President, you and Secretary Kanin need to move now. 
President Hassan, if you'll follow me. 
Yes? 
He's in the third car. 
The motorcade's coming up the ramps now. 
Officer, this is going down now. 
You can either stand here and do nothing or you can help me stop it. 
Cole, you need to stop Hassan's car now. 
The assassin is part of the evacuation detail. 
There is no bomb in the UN. 
It's too late-- Hassan's car just exited the tunnel. 
Cole, you need to stop that car, or Hassan's a dead man. 
Cole! 
What was that?! What happened? 
This is a damn disaster, Brian. 
What do you mean, you don't know what happened? 
How is Hassan? Is he all right? 
We don't know yet, Madam President. 
It appears the bomb threat at the UN was a hoax designed to get him out of the building. 
"It appears"? 
An IED was planted on Hassan's evacuation route. 
And you drove him right into it! 
One of our agents detected the ambush, tried to head him off just as the bomb exploded. 
Well, you better pray he got there in time. 
Security there! Now! 
Stand down! I'm with CTU. 
Sir, we need to move you to another vehicle. Now. 
Sir, you do not want to stay here. 
Go, go, go. 
Move! Move! 
Cole? 
Yeah. 
Thank God you're okay. 
I got lucky. 
Hassan escaped the blast; he's fine. 
He's heading toward CTU, eastbound on 48th Street in a black SUV. Got him. 
Mr. Hastings, here. 
Hassan, he's safe. 
Dana, the assassin was posing as a part of the security team. 
I know-- we got the info from Chloe. 
The police are putting up a thre e-bock cordon now. 
Cole? 
Cole? Cole, are you there? 
I've got the suspect he's dressed as a cop. 
Entering a white low-rise north of the UN. 
Call it in! I'm in pursuit! 
Chloe, I need to put out a priority APB. 
Move, move, move! 
What is it now? 
They've got a lead on the assassin. 
4722 East 47th Street. 
I'm gonna need my weapon. 
Your bag's right behind my seat. 
East 47th Street-- that's just above the UN. 
You're gonna need to turn now. 
Now! Now! 
UN Four, come in. 
UN Four, this is CTU Two. Come in, please. 
I'm sorry, I can't reach him. Try again. 
That's my husband in that car up there. 
They're not answering. 
I have to go to him. Dalia! Ma'am, 
please, you need to remain in the car. 
Stay calm. 
I'll try another number. 
Where are you? 
Yes, we're safe. 
Dalia, Kayla and myself. 
I need to know about my brother. 
He's alive. 
He survived. 
Farhad, how is he? 
He's alive. 
God is with us. 
Can you tell me what happened? 
A car in the motorcade swerved in front of him. 
They're locking down the entire area. 
What would you suggest we do? 
It's over. 
Get out now. 
It can't be long before they realize it's you. 
Farhad? 
Sir, please stay in the car! 
Please, sir. 
Sir, I need you to get back in the car. 
Oh! 
Get on your knees. 
Slide your weapon back to me. 
Slowly... 
slow... 
Now... you're going to walk me out of here. 
Call in. 
Say the southwest corner is clear. 
Tell them to move the search team to the northeast. 
Do it. 
You want to live? 
Make the call. 
This is Cole Ortiz in the southwest corner of the building. 
I'm in pursuit of the assassin. 
He's with me now. 
You okay? 
You okay? 
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. 
Okay. 
Son of a bitch. 
Mr. President, Brian Hastings. 
We spoke on the phone. 
We're glad you're here. Please follow me. 
Is my family here? 
No, sir. We'll try and get 
you all together shortly. 
Are they all right? 
Your wife and daughter are fine. 
And my brother? 
Was he hurt? 
No, sir. 
Mr. President... 
It appears your brother was involved with the attack. 
My brother? 
Yes, sir. 
That can't be right. 
Bring him to me. I need to talk to him. 
Unfortunately, we don't know where he is at the moment. 
Then how can you be sure it was him? 
Mr. President, after the explosion, 
he killed one of my men to facilitate his own escape. 
There were witnesses, including your wife and daughter. 
He's the insider we've been looking for. 
There's no doubt. 
Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry for interrupting. 
You asked for any updates about the assassin. 
And? 
He's dead. Jack just called it in. 
He uplinked some video footage that you need to see. 
I'll be there in a minute. 
Don't let me keep you from your job. 
Thank you, sir. 
No, thank you. I owe you my life. 
Conference room. 
Uh, Mr. Hastings, uh... 
Meredith Reed, the woman you brought here for questioning, where is she? 
Still here. 
Looks like she'll be cleared of any wrongdoing. 
I'd like to talk to her. 
I'll arrange it. 
Thank you. 
Excuse me. 
I saw that. What? 
The way you looked at me when he thanked me for saving his life. 
You think he should have been thanking you? 
I was actually thinking he should thank Jack, then Cole, then maybe me. 
I underestimated you, Chloe. 
You saw what was really going on; I did not. 
It was a major save. 
And my report will state that. 
Chloe said you have some video to show me. 
Yes, sir. Take a look. 
These are images uplinked by Jack Bauer from the bomb site. 
It's the assassin who was targeting Hassan. 
We have an ID? Not yet. 
But I believe we do have a workable lead. 
These are tattoos off the two men who attempted to take out our informant this afternoon. 
Same as the assassin. 
We believe they indicate membership in a particular Russian crime syndicate. 
What's a Russian gang have against the leader of the Islamic Republic? 
I don't know. 
Could just be hired muscle. 
But when the photos arrived, I ran them by the FBI. 
Turns out, they had an agent undercover working with the Russian mob here several years ago. 
A woman. Contact her. 
Already done. I have a 
helicopter bringing her in now. 
Chloe, I think you worked with her. 
Renee Walker. 
Says here she's no longer with the FBI. 
It's true. 
She resigned over an internal dispute. 
Meaning she was fired and her records have been sealed. 
What are we getting into here? 
Sir, we are only using her to brief us. 
These Russian groups are secretive to the point of paranoia. 
She's the only one who ever got close. 
President Omar Hassan was not harmed in the attack, and has since been taken to a secure location. 
Confirmed fatalities now stand at three... 
...including a police officer. 
Yes? 
Why is my brother still alive? 
You're upset, Farhad. 
Justifiably. 
Your man failed! 
Once you have the materials in your possession, your brother, his peace conference, none of that matters. 
Isn't that what you told me? 
All you have to do is stay calm and stick to your plan. 
Or should I be looking for another buyer? 
I'll be there soon. 
Good. 
We'll have a nice meal waiting. 
And we'll talk. 
I've been informed that the bomb threat was a hoax. 
That's confirmed, Madam President. 
We've swept the negotiating chamber with sniffer dogs and ground- penetrating radar. 
I can assure you, it's safe. 
I'm glad to hear it. 
Hassan is standing by at CTU. 
How is he, Rob? 
Well, he narrowly escaped being blown to pieces by his own brother, so not too well. 
But your call to him can't just be all sympathy and concern. 
We need to know where he stands vi s-Ã -vis the talks. 
It's hardly the time. 
No, it's exactly the time. 
The signing is scheduled for tomorrow. 
Dozens of world leaders are already en route to New York. 
We need to know if we still have a peace process. 
Put him on. 
Sir, I have President Taylor for you. 
Madam President. 
I cannot begin to say how relieved I am that you survived this terrible attack, Omar. 
Thank you. 
I'm mortified that this outrage happened on U.S. soil. 
I'm the one who should be embarrassed. 
My brother, Farhad, did this. 
He betrayed me, and worse, he put you in harm's way. 
I should have realized what he's up to. 
We can only be betrayed by the people we trust. 
He fooled all of us. 
Sir, this is Rob Weiss. 
You've heard Farhad escaped. 
Can I ask what you think his agenda might be, aside from targeting you? 
Uh, w-what I mean, sir, is... does he have a plan? 
Yes, he has a plan. 
Regime change. 
Isn't that what you Americans call it? 
Mr. President, we're doing everything we can 
to apprehend Farhad, but while he's at large, I'd understand it if you wished not to continue the talks. 
However, I hope that I can persuade you to reconvene. 
We have come so far together. 
And to let this moment slip... 
Would be to hand Farhad victory. 
I will not give him this satisfaction. 
If you are willing to continue with these talks, so am I. 
I am delighted to hear it. 
Uh, if you could persuade Mr. Hastings here to release me. 
We'll coordinate with CTU so that you can return to the UN as soon as possible. 
I-I know that you want to be with your wife and daughter. 
Thank you. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
You want your office back, Mr. Hastings. 
It's fine, sir. 
Can I ask what you and President Taylor agreed? 
That I should return to UN as soon as possible. 
We'll make the arrangements. 
Uh, before I leave, I would like to thank the young man who saved my life. 
That would be Agent Ortiz. 
He's returning to CTU right now. 
You really should go to Medical. 
Yeah. 
Soon as I hand the body over to Forensics. 
What are you going to do? 
Finish my debrief, try and catch that last flight to Los Angeles. 
Thanks, Jack. It's been an honor. 
Take care of yourself, okay? 
Hey. 
I'm glad you're okay. 
Thanks. Me, too. 
We ID'd the assassin using your video footage. 
We think he was working for one of the Russian crime syndicates here. 
Any idea which one? 
Not yet. 
But we're bringing in someone to brief us. 
Good. 
Jack, it's Renee. 
What? 
Why? 
Six years ago, she worked undercover with the Russian mob. 
FBI says she's still one of the best experts they have. 
Have you spoken to her? 
No. 
I tried phoning her a few times, she never returned my calls. 
She made it clear she didn't want to speak to me, so I-I let it go. 
I heard she had a rough time. 
Yeah. 
Like, a really rough time some sort of a breakdown. 
She should be landing any minute. 
Look, she didn't want to talk to me then, she's not gonna want to talk to me now, and I want to respect that. 
So, please, don't tell her I'm here, okay? 
You sure? 
Yeah. Okay. 
I'll be waiting for you up in Debrief One. 
We'll get you a full set of photos as soon as possible. 
Thanks. Mm-hmm. 
Agent Ortiz. 
Mr. President. 
I want to thank you for saving my life. 
You're welcome, sir, but it wasn't just me. 
If it weren't for Jack Bauer and Chloe O'Brian, I wouldn't have been in place to make the save. 
Well, I'll thank them, too, but you risked your life for me. 
You put yourself between me and the bomb. 
My family and I are in your debt. 
What's that? 
It's a hazardous materials alert. 
Hazardous materials? 
Please wait here, sir. 
What's going on? 
The body triggered a hazmat alarm. 
We're reading radioactive contaminants. 
What sort of contaminants? 
Rad count's low, so it could be uranium. 
It's just trace elements. 
There's no danger. 
U-235? 
It's highly enriched uranium. 
You mean it's weapons-grade? 
Yes. How the hell did he 
come into contact with that? 
I don't know, but he had to have been exposed to it recently. 
I think I know the answer. 
What is it, sir? 
Sir, we're talking about nuclear materials. 
If you know something, you need to tell us. 
I need to talk to Mr. Hastings right now. 
Hey, Renee. 
It's good to see you. 
This way. 
Didn't know you were back at CTU. 
Yeah. Morris lost his job a year ago. 
I asked to be reinstated, and this is where they assigned me. 
So what about you? 
I heard you've been working for a security firm. 
Uh, I was. 
Didn't work out. 
So it's confirmed and you're certain. 
Thanks. 
It's Forensics. 
They confirmed the composition of the radioactive material. 
It's U-235, 94.7% pure, 
weapons-grade uranium. 
If you have an explanation, sir, I'm eager to hear it. 
Before we started this peace initiative, my country was close to developing a nuclear weapon. 
Yes, our intelligence was aware of that. 
You may also be aware that we could not enrich enough fissile material to arm it. 
Soon after our countries began to negotiate the peace process, my brother came up to me and said that someone had approached him with weapons-grade uranium. 
Who? 
Someone who had access to decommissioned Soviet stockpiles. 
You think it's the same Russians who were trying to kill you today? 
Yes, I do. 
I told my brother to stay away from them, but obviously he had other plans. 
Mr. President, 
the nuclear material that you were offered, you have any idea where it is? 
That man was contaminated recently. 
Doesn't that mean the materials are here in the U.S.? 
Farhad always used to tell me that our country will always be at the mercy of the West unless we become a nuclear power. 
You must find the Russians before they can get the uranium to my brother. 
We'll do what we have to do, sir. 
I'll notify my security forces to cooperate fully. 
Patty, get me the file on Renee Walker's undercover operation. 
The stars mean these men were part of the criminal elite. 
Vory v zakone. 
This one spent time in a Siberian prison camp-- IK-10. 
The number of spires means length of sentence. 
Three years? 
Three life terms. 
Must have escaped. 
Now these, broken cross, here, here and here. 
Same on all three. 
So what does it mean? 
Brian Hastings, director of CTU. 
I appreciate that you came in. 
So what does it mean? 
It means you can break our arms, you can break every bone in our body we'll never talk. 
It's supposed to be the symbol for a group called Red Square. 
Supposed to be? We tried to find them 
and never got close. 
A lot of rumors that they're ex-military, special forces, intelligence, whatever. 
I'm not sure they actually exist. 
They exist, Ms. Walker. 
And we need to find them. 
Why? 
You're aware of the attack in midtown today? 
You mean the smoking crater by the UN? 
Yeah, it was hard to miss. 
Well, we believe it's just the beginning, and that the group responsible is in possession of unsecured nuclear materials. 
Now Dana asked you here today to brief on background. 
But I have a much bigger ask. 
You were undercover for nearly two years with the Russian mob. 
Your cover's still intact. 
What are you saying exactly? 
Are you... are you asking me to go back in? 
Dana, Chloe, would you give us a moment, please? 
I wouldn't be asking if it weren't important, but yes, I want you to go back in. 
And this doesn't seem in the least bit I don't know, ironic to you? 
I know that you left the FBI under difficult circumstances. 
Difficult doesn't even begin to describe it. 
I can get you your badge back. 
I laid down my badge, Mr. Hastings. 
I took it from my pocket and I laid it down. 
So why would you possibly think that I want it back? 
Well, what do you want? 
What do I want? 
Nothing. 
You have weapons-grade uranium in the hands of the Russian O.C. 
I can do something about that. 
So I'll go back in... 
but not for a badge. 
Thank you. 
We brief in ten minutes. 
Hey. 
Just want to say good-bye. 
You're off finally? 
Yeah. 
How did Renee's debriefing go? 
It was going fine until Hastings kicked me out. Why'd he kick you out? 
It just started to get really uncomfortable. 
Is that her undercover file? 
Yeah. I'm just trying to get up to speed. 
They found traces of uranium on the assassin. 
Hastings says there's nuclear materials in play. 
Yeah, I heard. 
What's that got to do with Renee? 
He asked her to go back under with the Russians. 
What is it? 
Hey. 
Jack. 
Chloe didn't tell me you were here. 
I asked her not to. 
I didn't think you'd want to see me. 
Right. 
You tried to get in touch, and I didn't call back. 
Sorry. 
I was so happy to hear that you were okay, though. 
Thank you. 
I'm surprised that you're back at CTU. 
I'm actually not. 
I'm moving back to Los Angeles with my daughter. 
I'm supposed to be on a plane with her right now. 
Then what are you doing here? 
An old informant knocked on my door. 
Everything went downhill from there. 
The attack in midtown. 
That's why I'm here, too. 
I heard Hastings wants you to go undercover with the Russians again. 
He does. I've agreed. 
You really think that's a good idea? 
They need me. 
I'm not worried about them. 
I'm worried about you. 
I know what you did. 
Really, Jack? What did I do? 
You almost killed Wilson during your interrogation. 
In fact it was so bad, the FBI had to let you go. 
Even after everything you did that day. 
Renee, I know where you are, and it's a dark place. 
Yeah, and I've come back. 
It takes longer than you think. 
I wouldn't have signed up for this if I wasn't ready. 
And I don't think you are. 
Renee, this is too important. 
You need to let them take care of it. They will. 
I appreciate what you're trying to do, really. 
You said you were going to Los Angeles to be with your daughter, right? 
Please don't do this. 
Go to California, Jack. 
I have a briefing. 
You will receive an official apology for your detention here, but in the meantime I hope you can accept my sincere personal regrets. 
I'm sure you understand that given the threat to President Hassan, we were under extreme pressure. 
I would have thought that came with the job. 
Along with the ability to handle it. 
Good-bye, Mr. Hastings. 
Ms. Reed. 
Thank God you're all right. 
I was lucky. 
I heard it was Farhad who tried to have you killed. 
I can't believe he would betray you. 
He betrayed both of us, Meredith. 
And then I betrayed you. 
What are you talking about? 
I told them about us. 
I was scared. I panicked. 
I hope you can forgive me. 
There's nothing to forgive. 
But you stood by me. 
You didn't deny me. 
Even though you had a million reasons to. 
Before that moment, I... 
I never really knew what you felt for me. 
You should have. 
Didn't I make it clear? 
What? What is it? 
I nearly died today. 
And I saw how fragile it all is. 
Not only my life, but everything I've ever worked for. 
Any good I might be able to do. 
I just can't jeopardize that. 
I understand. 
I'm sorry. 
Don't be. 
Meredith... 
Six years ago I was undercover with these men. 
They were running an arms trafficking ring. 
We broke up the ring and arrested everyone except for the man in charge Vladimir Laitanan. 
He's our target. 
It was through him I first heard about the group Red Square. 
If anyone can connect us to them it's him. 
Everything I've read about Laitanan says he disappeared without a trace. 
How are you going to find him? 
Through this guy. 
Ziya Dakhilov. 
He's out on parole. 
He'll take us to Vladimir. 
The FBI offered Ziya full immunity if he gave up Vladimir. 
He turned it down and kept his mouth shut and did his time. 
I'm not FBI, I'm a former felon, remember? 
I'll be offering Ziya the deal of a lifetime. 
Trust me, he'll take it. 
Once I've made contact with Vladimir, I'll tell him that I've heard whispers of nuclear materials on the market. 
I'll say I have a buyer for them. 
Who's that going to be? Agent Ortiz? 
You up for this? 
Yes, sir. 
How much money are we talking about? 
For nuclear rods, we need to show offshore accounts of $100 million at least. 
Probably twice that. 
Okay, I'll get on that. 
Chloe will work up a backstory to cover the time after your release from prison. 
Now you and Agent Ortiz need to figure out where you met, how long you've known each other. 
Jack. 
I thought you'd left. 
I'm sorry to interrupt. 
But could I have the room with Mr. 
Hastings alone, please? 
You, too, Renee. 
I think I'll stay. 
So what's going on, Jack? 
Agent Walker hasn't been undercover for over six years. 
I think you're making a mistake by putting her in. 
Why don't you tell him what's really on your mind, Jack? 
I'll tell him exactly what I told you. 
I'm concerned about her, and this operation. 
So what does that mean? 
She's not ready for this. 
You must have other options. 
Mr. Hastings, 
no one else knows these Russians. 
No one else can get you as close. 
Unfortunately, I'm your only choice. 
I appreciate your concern, Jack, but she's right. 
She's our only way in. 
Fine, then I want to go with her. 
I assume your plan is trying to set up a competing buy? 
I'll act as a buyer. 
That won't be necessary. 
Agent Ortiz has already agreed. 
He doesn't have the experience. 
Then this is how he gets it. 
Not with nuclear weapons on the line. 
Mr. Hastings, 
I'm officially requesting that you send me in with Agent Walker. 
Jack, if you're willing to do this, I'd be foolish to object. 
We'll work up a cover for you and dovetail it with Agent Walker's alias. 
We're going to have to work fast. 
The Russians are going to want to unload the nuclear fuel rods as quickly as possible. 
I'm sorry. 
Are you sure this information is reliable? 
MAN : It checks out. 
All right then. 
Farhad is here. 
Bring him in. 
You look worried. 
Every cop in the country is hunting this man, but we let him come here? 
So, how does looking like a scared girl help us? 
This man is our buyer. 
Well, we found him, we can find another. 
Josef, my son, we are on the verge of the biggest deal of our lives. 
Farhad is paying us more than anyone dreamed possible, and you want to send him away because he makes you nervous? 
Sit down, please. 
A drink first, then some food. 
I want to see the rods. 
They will be on the same ship that will transport you back to your country. 
As soon as we have completed our financial arrangements. 
You'll be paid, Bazhaev, after I have the rods. 
They are in a secure place. 
Show me. 
You've seen the photographs. 
That's not good enough. 
I want proof that the rods exist or you will not be paid. 
You want proof, huh? 
Okay. 
Come with me. 
Josef... 
My younger son. 
He was transporting the rods... 
...and he was careless. 
There. You have your proof. 
How long will it take to get the rods to the ship? 
Five hours. 
I want to be there to supervise the loading. 
Whatever you want, my friend. 
Now where is my money? 
I'll make the call. 
Agent Walker worked undercover as Renee Zadan for 16 months before the bust went down and she was incarcerated. 
We're focusing on the period of time just after her release when she's supposed to be in Mexico working with Jack. 
years of travel materials mostly to and from Mexico City. 
What all do we know about this Ziya character that she's visiting? 
Not much. 
He pled out to a clas s-three felony one month after the bust. 
He's now in Long Island City working in an auto parts store as a condition to his early release. 
That's where Jack and Renee are headed now. 
Where exactly are they? 
En route. Just leaving Manhattan. 
Good. Chloe, download the 
cover materials to them. 
Walk them through it. 
Make sure there's no surprises. 
Jack, it's Chloe. 
You should be receiving a consolidated timeline plus detail files for travel and residency. 
Have they downloaded to your PDA yet? 
Yes, we got it, Chloe. 
Oh, and Dana would like for me to review the facts with you, if that's okay. 
We're fine, Chloe. 
I know how to prep a cover. 
I'm sure you do, it's just that... 
Chloe, it's all right. 
As soon as we got something, we'll get back to you. 
Okay, I guess I will leave you then. Good luck. 
Thanks. 
You got a problem? 
No, just that you've got everyone treating me like I'm an invalid. 
No one's treating you like an invalid. 
It's standard procedure. 
He's not gonna quiz me on the facts, Jack. 
He gonna take one look at me and decide if I'm lying. 
I know. And whatever happens after that, 
we need to be ready. 
It's hard being with you when you don't think that I'm up to this. 
I never said you weren't up to this. 
I said I was concerned about you. 
It's different. 
Whatever you call it, the fact is you don't trust me, not really. 
So here we are. 
Me and my babysitter. 
How are we on aerial? 
Already in place and they're not even there yet. 
Jack and Renee are five minutes from target. 
They should arrive just before he closes up shop. 
Walsh. 
Someday, you're going to have to tell me how you picked that name. 
I can't talk now. 
I like your apartment, Jenny. Real homey. 
And I gotta compliment you on your housekeeping skills, everything is in its place. 
And I've been admiring your photos, I hope you don't mind. 
And I've noticed kind of a theme. 
You and your boyfriend, I'm guessing. 
Is that right? 
Yes. 
I hope it's not too serious. 
We're getting married, Kevin. 
Wow. 
Who would have guessed? 
When I saw you, you weren't exactly wearing an engagement ring. 
So tell me about him. 
Kevin, don't. 
Don't what? 
I'm curious, can you blame me? 
He's... he's just a guy that I met. 
A guy you met. 
What's that mean, a guy you met? 
I just spent seven years in prison with some guys. 
Is that the kind of guy you mean? 
You know what? I'm beginning to see that 
we need to talk about this in person. 
Look, I told you that I'm in the middle of a crisis here. 
I can't. I don't have time. 
You know what, Jenny? In my experience, 
when something's important, you make time for it. 
Don't you think? 
Jenny, are you there? 
Don't call me that! 
What? 
I said...! 
You don't tell me what to call you, what not to call you, you understand that?! 
I'll call you whatever I want! 
You don't tell me anything, Jenny! 
Now get back here. 
I said... 
that I will as soon as I can. 
Yeah, well, it better be soon. 
That's him. 
Looks like he's closing up. 
Okay, we'll use these for comm so I can hear you in case you get into trouble. Okay. 
Hey. 
This is your last shot. 
You do not have to do this. 
I know, but I want to. 
: We're closed. 
What'd I say? 
Renee. 
Ziya. 
Nice outfit. Not a lot 
of men can pull off a skirt. 
When did you get out? 
I thought you were serving seven-to-ten. 
They let me out early. Good behavior. 
Good behavior. 
With warden? 
Well, eventually, yeah. 
But it's like anything else, you gotta work your way up. 
So why you here? 
I'm looking for Vladimir. 
Got a business proposition I know he'd be interested in. 
What kind of business proposition? 
Got a buyer, something big being sold. 
Yeah? I don't know. Vlad disappear. 
Hmm, maybe. 
But you can find him. 
Really? Why I do that? 
Why do you think? 
I don't know. 
I'll cut you in. 
Unless, of course, you're making so much money here that that's of no interest to you. 
See? Your greedy little eyes are saying, 
"Show me the money, " so what's the problem, Ziya? 
Parole bracelet? 
They know where I am 24-7. 
I'm like dog. 
I leave yard, I get shock. 
Well, then just help me out. 
Make some calls. 
Make calls? 
You know what happen I make call asking where's Vladimir? 
Tomorrow, have accident on way for work. 
No, sensitive information, done face-to-face, you know that. 
You're lucky. 
You get out. Me, I'm still in prison. 
Let me see the bracelet. 
No. 
Come on. No. 
Let me see it, Ziya. Hmm? 
Ziya... What? 
Have I ever messed you up ever? 
Come on. 
Let's see. 
I can get this off, guaranteed. 
You screw with this, you know what happen? 
Cops come running in. 
In two hours, I'm back inside. 
Parole violation. Shh... 
What? That's not gonna happen, 
I'm telling you. 
I know how to get this off. 
How do you know? 
'Cause I'm constantly having to deal with people like you, that's how. 
I can get it off if I can just hold it steady. 
But... you can't cut bracelet. 
I'm not gonna cut the bracelet. 
What have you done? 
What the hell have you done?! 
Like he said, he was trapped here. 
And think he's gonna help you now?! 
That's it. This is over. 
This is over! 
Maybe for you, Jack, but I'm just getting started. 
Find something to cauterize that wound. 
Damn it. 
The Russian people join you in mourning President Hassan. 
We both know the opposition that undid him had outside help. 
I just got off the phone with the Russian foreign minister. 
He said that he would be coming to the United Nations in five hours with the Russian premier to sign the treaty as scheduled. 
The credit for that is all yours. 
LOGAN: It's good to be back in the game. 
Elements inside the Russian government were behind both the assassination of President Hassan and the supply of nuclear material to his enemies. 
TAYLOR: The Russian government? 
The Russians inserted Dana Walsh at CTU months ago. 
She's their agent. 
If Bauer gets to her, this will all be finished. 
I want to know who killed Renee Walker. 
WALSH: Renee's dead? I'm sorry. 
You're sorry? 
(panting) I can give you the hitter. 
I want more than just names; I want proof! 
I have proof. 
An audio file. Film. 
Where? 
First I want my immunity deal back. 
I'm sorry. 
I won't give Dana Walsh immunity. 
I believe she knows the names of the people who facilitated the assassination of President Hassan, people working within the Russian government. 
TAYLOR: I won't allow it. 
You don't want to know the truth. 
What I want is to keep the Russians at the table. 
Allegations of this sort will drive them away. 
I've arranged a helicopter to fly you from CTU to McGuire Air Force Base. 
You're locking me down. 
I'm taking this helicopter. 
Tell your men to drop their weapons or you're gonna die. 
(dropping weapons) Out of the copter now! 
All security to the helipad. 
Security to the helipad now. 
Call the FAA, Air Force, say that we have a stolen helicopter that needs to be intercepted and forced down. 
WINNICK: Yes, ma'am. 
CHLOE (over comm): Jack, it's Chloe. 
What are you doing? 
Talk to me. 
Jack, talk to me. 
Can you hear me? 
Yeah, he can hear you. 
Comm's on, he's just not answering. 
Damn it. 
Air Force choppers are closing in on his position. 
PILOT: Mr. Bauer, you are ordered 
to turn the aircraft around and return to CTU. 
I repeat, turn the aircraft around now. 
Jack's descending. 
Air Force choppers are in pursuit. 
CHLOE: Jack, this is crazy. 
Come back to CTU. 
NYPD, this is Ranger One. 
Suspect just landed on the Cooper Building. 
We're gonna circle and maintain visual contact. 
DISPATCHER: Copy that. 
We're cordoning off a two-block radius around the building. 
We have a visual on NYPD. 
Two units approaching the building. 
They're one block out. 
(sirens wailing) Suspect's on the fire escape. 
He's descending to ground level. 
(sirens wailing) (sirens wailing) We've lost him. 
Attempting to reacquire. 
Dispatch, this is unit 27. 
We're at the building, but we've lost the suspect. 
DISPATCHER: Copy. We'll widen the perimeter. 
What the hell is Jack doing? 
He's not letting this go, that's what he's doing. 
Dana told him she has proof about the Russians. 
He'll probably come after her. 
That's crazy. 
She's locked down. 
Jack knows he can't get to her. 
He'll either figure it out or he'll die trying. 
I want you in the field. 
Meet with NYPD and coordinate an interagency search. 
Bring in whoever you need. 
Yep. 
Arlo, use satellite and traffic cam. 
Maybe we can track him from here. 
On it. 
(sighs) Keep me looped in on the search status. 
No, I don't want to be updated in ten minutes. 
I want a real-time uplink. 
They still haven't been able to lock Jack down. 
They lost him. 
He landed the chopper and escaped on foot. 
NYPD is securing a perimeter. 
CTU is coordinating an interagency search. 
If Jack gets this evidence and exposes the Russians, the agreement is over. 
The peace agreement may not be the only casualty. 
Madam President, you covered up the Russians' involvement. 
That's grounds for impeachment. 
Possibly a criminal indictment. 
You crossed a line, Madam President. 
But it may not be too late to step back and limit the damage. 
How? 
Expose the Russians. 
Grant Dana Walsh immunity in exchange for evidence. 
We'll launch an investigation through transparent international channels. 
Which will effectively end the peace deal. 
But it will save your administration. 
There is still a chance CTU will find Jack. 
Even if they do, the evidence is still out there. 
Eventually, it will surface. 
Allison... I know 
better than anyone how much this means to you. 
How much you've sacrificed personally to make it happen. 
Ethan, we are so close. 
And we will be again. 
If not during your administration, then during the next one. 
I wish I could believe that. 
Ethan, I want you to prepare... 
(sniffles) a statement announcing our withdrawal from this accord. 
We have a... 
(clears throat) a press conference in 40 minutes. 
I'll make the announcement then. 
As hard as this is, you're doing the right thing. 
(sniffles) (elevator doors squeak) Madam President. 
It's over, Charles. 
I've decided not to go through with the peace deal. 
Because of Bauer. 
Because the evidence implicating the Russians evidence that I helped cover up is-is potentially too lethal. 
I agree, Madam President. 
Doesn't sound like you have much of a choice. 
I'm surprised. 
I expected more of a fight from you. 
I'm nothing if not pragmatic. 
Although I am disappointed. 
I'm afraid you have to find some other way to repair your legacy. 
My own personal disappointment aside, it's a loss for the world. 
Yes, it is. 
Ethan's drafting my statement. 
I need to call Dalia Hassan. 
Hope that she'll forgive me for keeping the truth from her. 
Before you do, there is one thing you might consider. 
A way to preserve the peace deal. 
The peace deal is over. 
You said so yourself. 
I said it was over if the evidence comes out. 
Obviously, you can't grant Walsh immunity. 
The evidence would become public record. 
You need to control the evidence by keeping Walsh off the grid. 
Off the grid? 
Classify her as an enemy combatant and incarcerate her in a private facility. 
There is a private security firm I can recommend. 
They're effective and discreet. 
I have them standing by. 
Sounds like you've been giving this a lot of thought. 
Madam President, this evidence is hanging over your head. 
You need to deal with it. 
We can't keep Walsh locked up indefinitely. 
You wouldn't have to. 
Ms. Walsh may not give up 
the information willingly, but she will give it up. 
And once we have it, it won't matter what she claims. 
You're talking about using physical coercion. 
I know how deeply this offends your public and private sensibilities. 
It is repugnant, even immoral. 
But isn't morality relative, considering what's at stake here? 
You are still talking about torture. 
I'm talking about preserving a peace accord that is crucial to the security of this nation. 
And that can only happen if you acquire and control the evidence. 
Believe me, Madam President, I don't make these suggestions lightly. 
I appreciate the implications. 
I've tried to be as open and candid with you as I've been with anyone. 
And the truth is, I regret many of my own actions when I was president. 
But I've also had the time and the distance to see past them to a place of clear and deep understanding. 
What do you understand, Charles? 
Wielding the kind of power that I once had and you have now can change the world. 
But that often requires making impossible choices that challenge our most sacred ideals. 
If you're not willing to do that, you should take Ethan's advice and pull out now. 
This was taken eight minutes ago on the corner of 25th and Cleveland. 
Give Cole this information, have him redirect his search. 
Ms. O'Brian. 
I have President Taylor calling for you. 
Put her through. 
CHLOE (on phone): Madam President, Chloe O'Brian. 
Have you made any progress in finding Jack Bauer? 
Not yet. We're 
still searching. 
I think it's safe to assume he's on his way to CTU and that Dana Walsh is his target. 
That's, that's why I'm calling, Chloe. 
I want Walsh transferred to a safe house off-site. 
Madam President, I've doubled the security around Dana Walsh. 
I'm confident thiss the safest place for her to be. 
Your opinion notwithstanding, I'd feel more comfortable with her in a place where she can't be tracked. 
Agents from a private security firm are coming there to pick her up. 
A private security firm? 
You know as well as I do that Jack has contacts throughout the government, some of whom might be sympathetic to his situation. 
I'm not suggesting that you're one of those people, Chloe. 
I just, I just want to take every precaution. 
Yes, ma'am. 
I'm sending over the transfer order now. 
The agent in charge of the escort team is named Mark Bledsoe. 
Should be arriving there in a few minutes. 
Understood. 
Thank you, Chloe. 
I know this was difficult, Madam President, but you made the right call. 
These men of yours, I want them to use every method of noncoercive interrogation available to them. 
I've already given that standing order. 
No one wants this to get ugly. 
Oh, it's already ugly, Charles. 
(car horns honking) Thanks. I don't need 
the chargers. 
(phone line ringing) O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Jack. Please, come back now. 
This has got to stop. 
I need you to get me access to Dana Walsh. 
The president said she's lying. 
No, it's the president who's lying. 
She's covering up the evidence to protect the peace agreement. 
Even if she is, she must have good reason. 
Besides, it's not your call, it's the president's. 
She's covering up evidence of a terrorist attack against this country. 
She no longer has the call. 
You don't want to go against me on this. 
Are you threatening me? 
Chloe, I'm trying to ask you for help. 
I need you to put me in a room with Dana Walsh. 
You're being hunted by every law enforcement agency in the city. 
You're not thinking clearly. 
Right now, I'm the only one who is. 
You can't just go against everyone. 
Please, just come in here, and we'll figure this out before you get yourself killed. 
You know what, forget it, Chloe. 
I'll figure out another way. 
Jack, wait. 
What? 
If you do get the evidence from Dana, what are you gonna do with it? 
(panting) I just want the people who are responsible for this to be held accountable. 
All I need to do is expose them. 
The president's having her transferred out of CTU. 
Why? 
I'm not sure. 
She hired a private security firm. 
Where are they taking her? 
I don't know. 
Find out. 
I'll call you back. 
Chloe. 
Okay. I will. 
Thanks. 
(phone ringing) Yes? 
Jim, it's Jack Bauer. 
Jack Bauer. 
From what I'm hearing, you got the whole damn city after you. 
Look, I need your help. 
I'm running out of places to go. 
Running out? 
(wry chuckle) I'd say gone. 
What'd you do this time, Jack? 
The less you know, the better. 
For who? 
For both of us. 
Look. 
I'm gonna need weapons and equipment; I need it fast. 
Can you make that happen? 
I can make just about anything happen, Jack; you already know that. 
The problem is that you're a walking bull's-eye. 
Last thing in the world I need is you on my doorstep. 
You wouldn't have a doorstep if it wasn't for me. 
I'm calling in a favor. 
I'm gonna tell you what I want, and I want it ready when I get there. 
You understand me? 
Well, I see you haven't lost your personal touch. 
I'm gonna need a comm unit, two MP5s, an assortment of assault rifles and ammo, a full communication and surveillance package. 
I'll be there in ten minutes. 
(phone line ringing) Yeah? 
It's me. We're at CTU. 
You have Walsh? 
Not yet. I wanted to 
talk about something before we proceeded. 
Is there a problem? 
We put this team together on short notice, and we never had a chance to discuss what to do with the prisoner once we've extracted the information. 
Hand her back to CTU. 
Without the evidence, she has no teeth; she can't hurt us. 
Well, she can make accusations. 
Even without the evidence, something might stick. 
You can't afford that. 
What are you suggesting? 
We can make it look like the prisoner was killed while she was trying to escape. 
Wouldn't be difficult. 
I'm not sure we're willing to go down that path. 
You hired me to clean up this situation. 
In my professional opinion, that's what needs to happen. 
Talk it over with the client, but I need to know soon. 
Sir? 
Yes, okay, I'll let you know. 
Mr. Bledsoe? 
That's right. 
Chloe O'Brian, acting director of CTU. 
Heard you've had a rough day. 
Yeah, you could say that. 
I'll take you to Dana Walsh. 
Thank you. 
Where exactly are you taking her? 
I can't disclose that information. 
The whole point of this exercise is to keep Walsh off the grid. 
Yes, but I'm responsible for this prisoner. 
You were given a presidential order to turn over the prisoner. 
Actually, I'm gonna need to see that order. 
You should've received it already. 
Well, we didn't. 
Like you said, we've had a rough day. 
We were hit by an EMP and most of our systems are still down. 
Ms. O'Brian, we don't 
have a lot of time. 
Look, I can't let you take her unless I see the order. 
So, you can wait. 
Might take an hour, maybe more. 
Thank you. 
I'm sorry to be so by-the-book. 
It's-- I was just promoted to this position, and I just want to make sure that I dot all my I's and cross the T's. 
Right. 
Satisfied? 
Yeah, great. 
Good morning, Ms. Walsh. 
My name is Mark Bledsoe. 
The president's ordered your transfer to an off-site facility. 
You've been designated an enemy combatant by special executive order. 
What do you mean off-site facility? 
It's a secure location. 
Chloe, what the hell is going on? 
Where's Bauer? 
Where's my immunity deal? 
Just do what he says, Dana. 
We can do it the hard way or the easy way your choice but you're leaving here with us. 
Chloe, don't let them do this. 
Let's go. 
Please, they're gonna kill me. 
Chloe... 
Chloe, please. 
Chloe! 
Thank you for your cooperation. 
(sighs) All right, let's get units on these two intersections. 
(cell phone ringing) Have them run car checks on anyone passing through. 
I'll contact Transit Police, see about getting these subways locked down. 
Chloe, we're still in the middle of a grid search here. 
No sign of Jack. 
I just talked to him; he called me. 
What? 
He wants me to help him get to Dana. 
What did you tell him? 
I told him that she's being transferred to an off-site facility and that I would give him the address. 
And I almost did. 
But I can't. 
I'm under presidential orders. 
Besides, I don't think he's right. 
He's not thinking clearly. 
We have to find him before he gets himself killed. 
What if Jack is thinking clearly? 
If he's right, if the president's lying, and this conspiracy is real, we might be on the wrong side of this. 
Bottom line is, we were given orders to bring him in. 
That's what we're gonna do. 
All right. 
I need everyone's attention, please. 
We're mobilizing a sting operation in the field to be led by Agent Ortiz. 
The target is Jack Bauer. 
Let's get to work. 
Did you get what I need? 
Nice to see you again, too, Jack. 
Did you get it or not? 
Yeah, it's right over there. 
Everything you asked for-- right there. 
I've been checking the scanners. 
All the agencies are looking for you. 
But nobody will say what you did. 
It's not about what I did. 
They're afraid of what I'm gonna do. 
I don't know what they did to you, Jack, but it must have been pretty bad. 
I got to make a phone call. 
O'Brian. 
Hey, it's me. 
You find out where they're taking Dana? 
Jack, I want you to think about what you're doing. 
Just give me the address, Chloe. 
It's not too late to turn yourself in. 
Are you going to give me the address or not? 
Dana is being taken to a safe house in the Middle Village. 
It's an industrial laundry at 141 Juniper Valley Road. 
Okay, that's about ten minutes from here. I'll leave now. 
Call me when you arrive. 
I'm working on pulling up the interior specs. 
I'll be able to guide you in. 
Chloe, thanks. I know 
I've put you in a spot. 
Yeah. 
I'll get back to you. 
I need you to stay here. 
I might need you later. 
You can't come back here again. 
Besides that, we're even now. 
I'll let you know when we're even. 
Jim, please. 
I need your help, okay? 
Did O'Brian brief you? 
Yes, sir. 
We're drawing Bauer to this location where he thinks Dana Walsh is being held. 
It's an industrial laundry the DEA seized a year ago. 
CTU's been using it as a safe house, but there's no way Jack can know this. 
Understand, Bauer's a highly skilled operative. 
So we need to make everything as credible as possible. 
He'll be expecting sentries, so Beck, you're out front. 
Greer, you take the back. 
You two will be stationed inside. 
Everyone stays out of sight until Jack's between our choke points. 
We do the takedown when, and only when I give the order. 
We get this right, we take Jack by surprise before he has a chance to fight back. 
Gear up. 
Cole. 
Jack just called. 
He's ten minutes out. 
What's your status? 
We're on-site and getting ready. 
Remember, nonlethal force. 
Look, I don't want anything to happen to Jack either, but I can't tell my men not to defend themselves if their lives are in danger. 
You know that. 
He's calling me when he arrives. 
I'll let you know when that happens. 
All right. 
Let's go, guys, let's go. 
Madam President. 
I have a final draft of your statement. 
I think it best for now to cite President Hassan's death as the reason for your withdrawing. 
Then after the dust has settled, we can start prosecuting the Russians through back channels. 
Ethan, I've chosen not to withdraw from the peace agreement. 
And I'm keeping the press conference as scheduled. 
I don't understand. 
Dana Walsh is being moved from CTU to a private detention facility. 
She'll be off the grid, out of Jack Bauer's reach. 
I've authorized a private interrogation team to acquire the evidence. 
Acquire the evidence? 
Once we have it, she'll be irrelevant. 
(scoffs) Keeping the truth from Jack Bauer is one thing but authorizing the illegal detention and torture of a prisoner? 
How far are you willing to go to protect this lie? 
As far as necessary to preserve this treaty. 
It's vital to the security of this nation. 
And what I am doing is for the greater good. 
This was Logan's idea, wasn't it? 
The decision was mine. 
And I stand behind it. 
Now listen please listen to what I'm saying. 
I think this is about more than the grÃater good. 
I think your presidency has cost you your marriage and your children. 
And you think that this treaty will somehow redeem that loss... 
Ethan, that's enough. 
Now, listen, you've made this personal, and you've lost your way. 
I've known you long enough to see that. 
I implore you take a step back and look at this clearly. 
I said that's enough. 
I've explained my reasons. 
I appreciate your objections, but the debate is over. 
So, let's move on. 
Madam President, unless you stop what's being done in your name, I can't be a part of this any longer. 
Don't worry, I'll... 
I'll keep it to myself. 
Um, I'll cite my health as the reason for my resignation. 
After all, I'm here against doctor's orders. 
Ethan, please. 
We are almost there! 
You-you can't just abandon me like this. 
I'm not abandoning you. 
I'm listening to my conscience. 
Anyway, you've got Charles Logan now. 
Only room for one of us. 
Madam President. 
(door opens, then closes) Look at me. 
My hand is shaking. 
I would be concerned if it weren't. 
What you've agreed to take on is not something that could be treated lightly. 
I keep thinking that people will accuse me of grabbing for power. 
Exploiting my husband's death. 
Which couldn't be further from the truth. 
Still, some people may perceive it that way. 
Remember what father said? 
He said the best way to dispel public misperception is to address it directly. 
Good. 
I will take his advice. 
Jamot, will you excuse us? 
Of course. 
I just need to remind you that the other delegates are expecting you in 20 minutes. 
I'll be ready. 
Miss Kayla. 
Jamot. 
Mother, I'm sorry for being so selfish earlier. 
You were afraid. 
You lost your father today. 
And you were afraid of losing me as well. 
I still am. 
This peace agreement Father died for how can so many people be so violently against it? 
Some people are so invested in their fear and hatred that peace is the most threatening thing they can imagine. 
Chloe, you still there? 
CHLOE (over comm): Yes. 
I'm at the site. 
I only see one man out front. 
I found a schematic of the building. 
There's a side entrance to the north of the loading dock. 
I got it. 
It looks like it's out of the sentry's line of sight. 
According to the schematic, there's an enclosed room at the southwest corner of the building. 
That must be where they're keeping Dana. 
Copy that. Chloe, I got go. 
I'm moving in. 
Cole, he's going into the loading dock entrance heading towards the takedown point. 
COLE: I see him. 
Hopkins, Lee, Jack's moving into the building and headed toward your position. 
Stay sharp. 
Copy that. We're ready. 
(clattering) (taps twice) Chloe, it's Jack. 
I got a visual on the room. 
No hostiles in sight. 
I'm going to try and grab her. 
Be careful, Jack. 
Okay, copy that. 
(panting) (grunts) Cole, he's almost at the takedown point. 
Copy that. 
On my way. 
Hopkins, we're moving in. 
Son of a bitch. 
Put your weapons down! 
Put your weapons down now! 
I can't do that, Jack! 
Cole, tell them to put their weapons down or I will kill him! 
COLE: Put that gun down now! 
Put your weapons down now! 
Now! 
Put 'em down! 
Put 'em down! 
Tell your men to get down. 
Do it. 
Get on the ground. 
Now! 
Cole, slowly advance towards me. 
Kick the guns over in my direction. 
Get out of my line of sight. 
How did you know? 
I know Chloe. 
You're gonna call CTU. 
You're gonna tell her that her plan worked, and you've got me locked down and ready for transport. 
Put it on speaker. 
CHLOE (on speakerphone): O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Cole. 
Cole, go ahead. 
What's happening? 
We've got Jack. 
He's locked down. 
Is he okay? 
He's fine. 
What about your men? 
They're all right. 
I know I should feel relieved, but I just feel worse. 
Like you said, Chloe, it's for his own good. 
I'll talk to him when he gets here. 
Lock your men down. 
What are you planning on doing? 
Lock 'em down! 
All right, Jack, what now? 
JACK: Follow me. 
Take a seat. 
You're why I'm here, Cole. 
I knew Chloe would send you. 
You're the only reason I risked it. 
What do you want with me? 
I need you to help me gain access to Dana Walsh. 
I know you well enough, Cole, that I know you don't want to be a part of this cover-up. 
And right now President Taylor wants the peace agreement to move forward so badly, she's willing to lie about the Russian's involvement in today's terrorist attack, and I can't let that happen. 
How can you be sure the President is lying? 
Because she told me to my face! 
She said the agreement was more important than the Russians could have done today. 
Why the hell do you think she came down to CTU to talk to me? 
She didn't want me to give the evidence from Dana. 
She wanted to shut me up and lock me down Damn it, Cole, your hands aren't clean in this. 
You protected Dana while she was operating for the Russians. 
You lied for her, which enabled the Russians to provide nuclear materials to Hassan's opposition. 
They facilitated his assassination and what, you lost four of your men today, right? 
I am giving you an opportunity to make this right, to make the people that are responsible for everything that happened today accountable. 
You got a decision to make. 
Now, what if you're wrong? 
I'm not. 
Look, I can't do this on my own. 
Your call. 
Chloe says she's in a safe house a few miles from here. 
We'll notify CTU about your men within the next two hours. 
Right now it's imperative that they think I took you hostage. 
Get up! 
REPORTER: We've been hearing speculation that Dalia Hassan will be making her first official statement as the provisional head of state of the Islamic Republic of Kamistan. 
Earlier, we spoke to a UN official who confirmed that under the IRK's constitution, Mrs. Hassan would have 
the authority to sign this treaty. 
Ethan! (turns TV off) 
I, uh, I heard about your resignation. 
I'm glad to see you're putting your health first. 
We all just want you to get well. 
I'm leaving because of you. 
Because of what you've started here. 
You've deliberately played this out to maneuver the President into a corner. 
I brought the Russians back to the table. 
But you didn't tell her how you were doing it. 
She didn't ask. 
Because she knew it was best for her to preserve her own deniability. 
The President knows exactly what she's doing. 
She's smart. 
She's smarter than either of us ever gave her credit for. 
I see. 
So, uh, you just provided counsel. 
That's right. 
Well, let me counsel you. 
Stop this cover-up before it's too late. 
This peace is no good. 
There's too much blood on this treaty for it ever to hold. 
We've both been in this game a long time, and we both know damn well that every treaty ever written had blood on it! 
Not like this. 
You got Allison so far into the woods, she'll never be able to find her way out. 
She wasn't like you. 
Wasn't like any politician I've ever known. 
That's right. 
She's finally got some teeth. 
You listen to me. 
If she suffers for this, I will come after you with everything I have. 
You're threatening me. 
I'm warning you, Charles. 
Do you need to sit down? 
(scoffs) I'm fine. 
Well, then, if you don't mind, Allison will be taking the podium any second now. 
(turns TV on) Get some rest, Ethan. 
You need it. 
(Dana gasping) You told Bauer you have evidence. 
I need to know where it is. 
Come on, Miss Walsh. 
You know the deal. 
The sooner you tell me, the easier it'll go. 
Please, I have got nothing to tell you. 
There is no evidence. 
If that's the way you want to play it, fine. 
(gasping) PRESS SECRETARY: Ladies and gentlemen, no questions will be taken until after this morning's address. 
Madam President, I want to thank you for your thoughts on my speech. 
They were very helpful. 
I'm glad. 
My husband would have been grateful for the support that you have given me. 
Thank you. 
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. 
My fellow Americans and friends in foreign lands, I speak to you this morning with a heavy heart. 
The brutal and cowardly murder of President Omar Hassan was a blow to every civilized person in the world and a stark reminder that the pursuit of peace sometimes comes with a steep price. 
President Hassan understood that, yet still had the fortitude to pursue a better tomorrow against so many odds. 
I join with the American people in mourning him and every other innocent life that was lost during this crisis. 
But let it be known here and now their sacrifice will not have been in vain. 
Peace must and will prevail no matter the cost. 
No matter the cost, no matter the compromises. 
We have waited too long and worked too hard, to allow this opportunity to pass us by. 
And that is why in Omar Hassan's name, I am choosing to move forward with this historic summit. 
One that was made possible by the shared hopes and ideals of the IRK leadership, (gasping) and will continue under its new leader a woman of unparalleled courage and grace, who has been chosen by her people to carry on the mantle of her late husband... 
Dalia Hassan. 
Transcript by Addic7ed.com 
You know I have the fuel rods. 
But I have no desire to harm innocent Americans. 
And yet you're threatening them with a bomb. 
What I'm asking for is simple. 
Turn over President Hassan. 
That will never happen. 
You have exactly one hour to change your mind. 
We have an out here. 
I think we should take it. 
Give in to the demand to turn over President Hassan? 
I will not sell him out to the very terrorists that we are determined to defeat. 
What are you suggesting? 
A covert action. 
We deliver Hassan to the terrorists, but make it look like they took him hostage. 
I'm begging you. 
Don't do this. 
Don't betray your president. 
Ethan? 
All right. 
My God! Call 911. 
We wait to acquire Hassan before calling an ambulance. 
Understand? 
Take the weapon off now! 
A dirty bomb will be detonated in New York unless we deliver Hassan to the terrorists. 
Does the president know about this? 
She's refusing to deal with the terrorists. 
This is General Brucker's operation. 
 Get up.   What are you doing? 
This is on you now. 
You have to deliver Hassan to the terrorists. 
I don't take orders from anybody but the president of the United States. 
Now, move. 
Are the Americans handing over Hassan or not? 
The only information we have is that he's being transported to McGuire Air Force Base. 
So, President Taylor doesn't intend to give him up. 
 Tarin.   Yes? 
The president has not responded. 
Start the countdown. 
The NYPD will handle hazmat and triage; the National Guard will control the streets; and I've got an army battalion standing by. 
Well, a dirty bomb is about to go off in Manhattan, Commander. 
I'd plan for mass panic. 
Ethan Kanin is dying back there. We need 
 to get him medical help.   We will. 
 I mean now.   No, not until our team comptes its mission. 
When we have the bomb, then we'll get your friend help. 
Madam President. 
Carry on. 
General, what's our status? 
Well, the civilian first responders are positioning for rapid deployment, and we've got army support available as necessary. 
At this point, only command level knows we're anticipating a radiological device, but people on the ground are quick to connect the dots. 
 Word will get out.   Yeah. I'd like to get ahead of that. 
I've drafted an address for the networks, Rob, I need you to look at it. 
And I'd like Ethan to read it, too. 
He wasn't in his office. Do you know where he is? 
I'll go find him. 
Less than ten minutes. 
Dear God, this bomb cannot go off. 
I'm sorry, Madam President, but we have to prepare for the worst. 
What are the latest casualty figures? 
Median scenario shows 58,000 dead over three days due to the bomb and ensuing panic. 
But who knows? 
Maybe we'll get lucky. 
Let me know the second President Hassan arrives. 
Yes, ma'am. 
This is not right. 
My life for so many others. 
It's not right. 
President Taylor doesn't see it that way. 
She knows I would never have gone along with this decision. 
That's why she kept me out of it. 
You are more than just one life, Omar. 
You are the best hope of ending a war that has lasted for decades. 
You must understand President Taylor trying to protect that. 
This is not acceptable... not like this. 
Get in here. 
Get down. 
What are you doing? 
He's slowing us down. 
Don't worry. He'll be fine. 
His injuries aren't lethal. 
Jack, I need to talk to you. 
What? 
Hassan isn't happy about Taylor's response to the ultimatum. 
Doesn't matter. It doesn't affect our mission. 
He's a head of state, Jack. Maybe it should. 
It's not our call. If he wants 
to take it up with President Taylor, he can do it when he sees...  
 Mom!   What? 
 Throw your gun down.   Omar, what are you doing? 
Mr. President.  
Kick it to me. 
Omar, have you lost your mind? 
You, outside! 
Back up inside! 
Sir, you do not want to do... 
Just shut up and move it inside! 
I'm giving you what you want. 
Here, take the gun. 
Omar, what are you doing? 
I'm sorry, Dalia. 
My life for tens of thousands? 
 I couldn't live with that.   Omar, don't. 
You can't give yourself up. 
I have to. 
What if they're lying? 
What if they blow up the bomb anyway? 
At least I've tried to stop the attack, and I've failed. 
But if I don't even try... 
Father, please. 
You stay here with Kayla. I'll send someone 
 from our delegation to pick you up.   No. 
No. I won't leave you. 
 Dalia, do as I say. Do as I say!   If you want me to stay here, 
then you better lock me in that room because I won't let you walk to your death! 
 I won't leave you!   Dalia, I said do as I say! 
 No!   Back in the room! 
Now! In the room! 
We've got less than five minutes. We got to move. 
Mr. President! 
Mr. President, you can't trust him! 
You can't trust him! 
Come on. 
These people owe you their lives, sir. 
You're doing the right thing. 
Excuse me. 
Do you have the package? 
Yes. 
You're cutting it damn close. You know that? 
Yeah, there were complications. 
Jack Bauer found out about our operation. 
He's no longer a problem. 
Casualties? 
The entire unit. 
Everyone but me. 
Sir, you need to know that President Hassan is cooperating with us. 
He's here by choice. 
Well, what are you saying? 
That he would have given himself up? 
Yes, sir. We got to move. 
All right. Stay on the line. 
Weiss. 
Look at him. He'll be dead soon 
if we don't do something. 
Yeah, along with half of New York. Bishop's on the line. 
He's got Hassan. Get ready to make the call. 
Bishop, we're live. You there? 
 Yes, sir.   All right, we got less than two minutes. Do it. 
 Yes.   This is Rob Weiss, 
President Taylor's chief of staff. 
Do you have Hassan? 
Yes, and we're prepared to make the exchange. 
Prove it. 
Uh, Bishop, put him on. 
He wants to talk to you. 
This is President Hassan. 
I'm prepared to give myself up if you stop the bomb. 
So, President Taylor changed her mind. 
No. She wasn't willing to meet your demands. 
I am. 
But I need assurances. 
 Assurances?   Yeah. 
That the exchange will... 
The exchange will happen exactly as you're told. 
What you'll do is exactly what I say. 
Damn it. We did what you asked. 
Quit stalling. We're running out of time. 
He cut us off. 
A minute and a half till the bomb goes off. 
Yes? 
Tarin... 
stop the bomb. 
Hassan will be arriving there shortly. 
You know what to do. 
Yes, all right. 
Bomb was supposed to go off four minutes ago. 
There's no report of an explosion anywhere on the island. 
Arlo, what's happening on the ground? 
Sweep teams are still looking everywhere. No luck. 
According to the deadline we've been given, we're on borrowed time. 
The bomb is still out there, still a threat. 
We may have caught a break here. 
Let's use it. 
O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. I need your help. 
Reception is terrible. 
I can barely hear you. 
 Can you hear me now?   Yes. 
President Hassan is trying to hand himself over to the terrorists. 
That's why the bomb didn't go off. 
No one here knows that. 
And no one else can until I talk to the president. 
What's going on? 
Chloe, I don't have time to explain. 
Please, just contact Tim Woods. 
He can get me a clean line to the president. 
But no one else can know that I'm calling. 
Do you understand? 
I'll call you right back. 
Who was that? 
Search team. 
Requesting updated grid assignments. 
Do you need some help? 
I'll ask if I do. 
We're clear! 
Keep them up here on the landing. 
Nothing. 
I need you to get them back to President Taylor. 
What about you? 
I'm going to say behind and look for Hassan. 
Ma'am, I just got off the phone with CTU. 
They're going to help me find your husband. 
But right now it's not safe here for you. 
I want you and your daughter to continue on to the Air Force Base. 
Agent Walker will help you get there. 
She can be trusted completely. 
Mr. Bauer, my father, he did 
 what he thought was best.   I know he did. 
We're gonna do everything we can to get him back, but right now we need to move. 
Let's go. 
Jack, he gave himself up willingly. 
Maybe we should just let this happen. 
I already told you, it's not our call. 
President Taylor asked me to protect him. 
That's what I'm gonna try and do. 
So, please, just get them to the Air Force Base. 
Taxi! 
Come on. 
This is Bauer. 
I got a secure line. 
Good. Chloe, I need you to do something else for me. 
I'm on Seventh Avenue between 53rd and 54th. 
There's a security camera mid-block. 
I want you to see if you can get a feed and roll it back. 
President Hassan was standing here less than ten minutes ago. 
I'll check. 
Seven minutes past the deadline. 
Do we have any idea why the bomb didn't go off? 
No, Madam President. 
We're polling our civilian counterparts, trying to determine that. 
Maybe it's like you said. 
We got lucky. 
Well, at the moment it certainly looks that way. 
What about President Hassan? 
When will he arrive? 
Well, his transport was a Secret Service operation, ma'am. 
 I'm not really in the loop.   I'll look into it. 
No, I'd rather you find Ethan. 
 I'll page him.   No, 
not page him, find him. 
I need him here. 
Please. 
Yes, ma'am. 
 Madam President?   Yes? 
It's an urgent call from Homeland for you. 
Excuse me. 
This is President Taylor. 
Madam President, this is Jack Bauer. 
Please don't say my name or react openly to what I'm about to tell you. 
Yes. 
President Hassan is no longer in my custody. 
He got away and he's trying to hand himself over to the terrorists. 
That's why the bomb didn't detonate. 
I'm afraid I don't understand. 
Madam President, you're being betrayed by General Brucker. 
40 minutes ago we were attacked by mercenaries under his command. 
Go on. 
We managed to fight off the attack, but President Hassan turned himself over to one of them in an effort to stop the bomb from going off. 
As we speak, they're preparing to hand him over to the terrorists. 
I'm assuming that that is still something that is unacceptable to you. 
That is correct. 
Madam President, General Brucker is in charge of this operation. 
He's in communication with the terrorists. 
I need to know where the exchange is gonna take place. 
 Ma'am, you need to confront him now.   I understand. 
As soon as you have anything, please contact CTU. 
I will. 
Thank you, ma'am. 
Come with me, please. 
Chloe, it's Jack. You still there? 
 I'm here.   What do you got? 
Got the security camera feed you were talking about. 
Hassan got into a black SUV at 6:08 with one other guy. 
That's got to be the merc he handed himself over to. 
They were headed west on 53rd Street. 
I was able to trace them until they turned north  on Tenth Avenue.   Okay, good work. 
Redirect the satellites to the Upper West Side. 
I'm on my way. 
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
Stop! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
What now? 
Who's this? 
Listen carefully. 
Hand the phone to the driver. 
Tarin. 
It's you, isn't it? 
Hand it to him now. 
He wants to talk to you. 
It's Bishop. 
Okay, Bishop, this is what you need to do. 
Listen to my instructions and follow them. 
Step out of the car, leaving the keys in the ignition. 
Take the phone with you. Do it now. 
Walk toward the intersection. 
When the light changes, I want you to cross the street. 
Stay inside the crosswalk. 
Where's the bomb? 
Just do what I say. 
The deal was Hassan for the bomb. 
The light's changed. Bishop, move. 
Where is it? 
Just do what I say. 
Shut up. Listen. 
Stop now. 
Don't turn around or you get nothing. 
Stand there and wait. 
Turn around. 
Walk toward the newspaper stand. Look down. 
Show me your hands. 
Hands! 
On the dash. 
Where's the bomb? 
Where is it? 
Where is he? 
The General's in Mr. Kanin's office. 
With Ethan? 
We're not sure. No one's seen him in nearly an hour. 
Ma'am, there's something you need to know. 
Your chief of staff is with the General. 
They appear to be in on this together. 
Are you saying Rob Weiss betrayed me, too? 
I'm afraid so. 
Okay, do it. 
Don't move. 
Hands where we can see them! 
Up! 
Call medical. 
Against the wall, hands behind your head. 
Madam President, you need to see this. 
Oh, my God. 
Is he still alive? 
Yes, ma'am. 
He's had a serious cardiac event. 
Get him out of here! 
No! You stay. 
Where is President Hassan? 
Damn you, Rob. 
Where is he? 
I don't know. 
Don't lie to me! 
Tell me where he is. 
No, ma'am, I cannot. 
And if it makes any difference, this was not an easy decision. 
It makes no difference at all. 
It wasn't your decision to make. 
With all due respect, you were not elected to sentence tens of thousands of Americans to death. 
Is that how you justify this? 
You have sold out a peace I committed this administration to. 
I've protected New York and given you plausible deniability in an impossible situation. 
I don't want deniability. I want Hassan! 
We are on the verge of a peace that has eluded this planet for 50 years, and you are throwing it away! 
Tell me where he is. 
The charge is treason. 
It carries the death penalty, and so help me God, I'll throw the switch myself. 
Tell me where he is. 
It's not too late.  
It is too late. 
They have Hassan. 
We have the bomb. 
The bomb's at Amsterdam and 93rd. 
We'll get NEST team there as soon as possible. 
Damn you, Rob. 
Really, Madam President? 
New York City is safe. 
Take him away! 
Your attention, please. 
I've just spoken with the president at McGuire. 
Rogue operatives have handed Hassan over to the terrorists. 
In return, they got the location of the dirty bomb: 93rd and Amsterdam. 
Jack Bauer and NEST are already on-site and disarming the bomb. 
Our focus is to recover President Hassan. 
I've got satellite feed at 93rd, sir. 
Okay, looks like we're back in business. 
Put it up on-screen, Arlo. 
We know that President Hassan was handed over at that location approximately ten minutes ago. 
NSA feed only gives us still images. 
We might have missed him. 
We didn't. There's Bishop's SUV. 
Okay, they've got to be close; find them. 
Someone's approaching the SUV. 
Any idea who that is? 
I can try to clean up the image. 
Lost it. 
They were heading east. 
We can backtrack through the traffic cam footage. 
I want you and Dana to find that vehicle. As soon as you reacquire it, 
let Jack know. 
Dana, where are you going? 
Hastings wants us to do this. 
I was thinking I would reroute some of the servers. 
Not now. 
It'll give us more processing speed. 
We can work with what we have. Let's get going. 
Okay. 
Those are the rods we were looking for, sir, packed in enough C4 to irradiate half of Manhattan. 
Okay, as soon as they're extracted, I want you to contact CTU. 
Thanks. Yes, sir. 
I want him transferred back to holding in medical. 
Contact Hastings as you're en route. 
So it's real. 
A dirty bomb. 
Yeah. 
Then we succeeded. 
We saved Manhattan. 
You betrayed your president and your country. 
Get him out of here. 
This is Bauer. Go ahead. 
Jack, it's Chloe. 
We've got Hassan's location. 
He's heading north on Amsterdam in a black SUV. 
 How far north?   About... 
 30 blocks ahead of you.   Jack, the president wants us 
to do everything we can to recover Hassan. 
She wants you to lead the operation. 
How many men are with him? 
 We think only one... the driver.   Okay, Chloe, 
I need you to find me a suitable ambush point. 
I want clean lines of fire from rooftop and street level. 
In order to protect Hassan, we need to take the vehicle and the driver out at the same time. 
Tac teams are standing by, Jack. 
 Is Cole with them?   No, on his way back. 
We expect him here any minute. 
Then he's going to have to quarterback this op from CTU. 
I'll get you real-time updates on the position of Hassan's vehicle. 
Copy that. 
Cole's back. 
I'll go get him. 
Yes? 
Hello? 
I'm so glad you're back. 
Yeah, me, too. I heard we recovered the bomb. 
Only 'cause Hassan gave himself up to the terrorists. 
Jack's putting together an intercept operation right now. 
He wants you to run it from here. 
All right, you'd better bring me up to speed. 
What happened to that probation officer that was sniffing around? 
I convinced him I didn't know anything; he left. 
That's good. 
Yeah, it's good. 
Hey. 
We're going to get through this, you and me. 
We will. 
We should go. 
You don't have to do this, Tarin. 
You can pull over right now, stop the car. 
Believe me, I want to do this. 
If you hate me so much, stand against me at home. 
Join the opposition. 
Fight me openly, honorably. 
I don't need to fight you, Hassan. 
You have already lost. 
So tell me, what's the plan? 
You'll put me on trial? 
A dark room and a video camera, I suppose. 
A man hiding behind a mask... 
will read a list of my crimes and cut off my head with a sword. 
The world will be impressed. 
You've done worse in your prisons. 
Whatever I did... 
I did to unite our country, to make us stronger. 
That's a lie! 
You just wanted to hand us over to the Americans. 
No. 
I wanted us to rejoin the world. 
I wanted us to have peace. 
You wanted the cover of Time magazine. 
You think I don't know you, Omar. 
I watched over you day and night, remember, watched over you while you betrayed your own wife with a Western whore. 
You care for nothing but yourself. 
Yes. 
Yes, I've made mistakes... 
but believing in peace was not one of them. 
Think whatever you like. 
You won't be around to find out. 
Madam President Just, just a moment. 
They're going to treat you on the base hospital. 
But then I want you right back here. 
That's an order. 
Excuse us just a moment. 
You have always been true to me, Ethan. 
I need you now. 
Hurry back. 
Take good care of him. 
Madam President, Mrs. Hassan and her daughter have just arrived. 
Thank you, Susan. 
I am so relieved you're both safe. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
Do you know what is happening with my husband? 
We do. 
He is in the hands of the terrorists, but we're tracking him on satellite. 
We're going in now to monitor the rescue effort. 
Do you want to join us? 
Yes. 
All right. 
If you will, go on in the situation room, and, and I'll be there in a minute. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
I didn't expect to see you again, Ms. Walker, 
but in these last few hours, I have learned how few people I can really trust. 
I am glad you're here. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
But I think I'd be of more use at CTU. 
Of course. 
Susan will arrange a car for you. 
Thank you, ma'am. 
Thank you. 
Jack Bauer and CTU are running the operation. 
We expect the intercept to occur in a few minutes. 
Okay. 
Ma'am, satellite feed's coming in from CTU. 
Jack, Hassan's vehicle just crossed 130th. 
I'm at 110th Street. 
Do we have an ambush point yet? 
Yes, intersection of 161st and Amsterdam. 
Who we got for the take-down team? 
I have a special ops unit moving into position. 
We'll trigger the traffic lights to stop the vehicle at the intersection, then heavy machine gun fire into the engine block to disable it, snipers to take out the driver. 
That leaves you  to reacquire Hassan.   Good. 
What's our perimeter look like? 
Bridges and tunnels were closed earlier this morning. 
That means Riverside Drive is shut down, too. 
He can only use Amsterdam. 
What about cross streets? 
We got 'em all covered from 140th Street on. 
As long as we don't spook him, he'll drive straight into the ambush. 
Copy that. Leave this line open 
in case there are any changes in the route. 
 You got it.   What's our timing? 
Given traffic flow, Tarin should hit the intersection  in eight minutes.   I can use traffic lights 
to slow him down if Jack hasn't caught up. 
Fine, I'll let the president know. 
Cole, I'm seeing some fluctuations in the carrier signal on the subnet. 
What's that mean? 
It might be a problem with the trunk line. 
We can't afford another dropout with the satellite feed. 
That's how we lost the rods in the first place. 
Chloe, what's the status of your workaround on the trunk line? 
It's working fine if you ask me. Do you need me to check it? 
No, we need you here. 
I can check it if you can watch my screen,  Chloe.   Okay. 
Thanks, Dana. 
Arlo, what are you doing here? 
I could ask you the same. 
Cole asked me to check on the trunk line. 
Except the trunk line's over here. 
I can do it from here also. 
I set up this system, you know. 
Right. 
Sorry. 
Then maybe you can explain why they keep going down. 
We were hit with a massive electromagnetic pulse. 
It's a miracle we managed to get anything up and running again as fast as we did. 
So, what are you doing now? 
I'm running a diagnostic on the trunk line. 
Why were you looking at a map of Manhattan if you're running an internal diagnostic? 
I was checking the progress of the operation. 
How I do my work is none of your business, Arlo. 
Actually, given that I've been having to cover for you the entire night, I think it is my business. 
Fine. 
You want to check up on me, go ahead. 
You're really going to do this. 
Yeah, I am. 
So, where are the diagnostics? 
In the systems folder, where they always are. 
No, I mean... where on your screen? 
Thought you said you were working on this. 
I wasn't using diagnostics. 
I was monitoring the voltage fluctuation in the trunk line directly. 
Really. How? 
I thought you knew everything. 
 Yeah.   Arlo, where are you? 
Hastings's been looking for you. 
Yeah, I'll be right down. 
Hastings wants me on the floor. 
I'll leave you to do whatever you're doing. 
Don't push it, Arlo. 
Yes. 
CTU is following you. 
Where? Where are they? 
They're all over you. 
There's an ambush set for 161st. 
I'm nearly there. 
Why am I only hearing this now? 
Look, I am already doing far more than I've been paid to do. 
You need to calm down. 
We knew this might happen. 
Can you find me an exit? 
There's one between 158th and 159th. 
 parking garage.   158th, 159th. 
Is everyone ready for this? 
I will let Samir know, and then it is up to him. 
It's only a matter of time before this gets traced back to me. 
I need you to get the hell out of there when I still can. 
Hassan is crossing over 148th Street. 
I'm activating signals up to 160th. 
You took your time. 
I'm sorry. It got complicated. 
Is the trunk line going to hold? 
Yeah, I think so. 
Then we keep going. 
What's our timing, Chloe? 
Intercept: four minutes. 
Jack, do you have a visual on Hassan yet? 
 Negative.   He's five blocks ahead of you, Jack. 
Roger that. Tac teams in position? 
 They're good to go.   Okay, nobody move 
until Hassan's vehicle is stopped in the intersection. 
What are you looking for? 
We are being followed, aren't we? 
Shut up. 
That phone call... it's a warning. 
CTU is onto you. 
I'm not afraid of CTU. 
Why are you looking over your shoulder  all the time?   I said shut up! 
Tarin, it's not too late. 
Give yourself up. 
Give yourself up, and I'll speak for you. 
I won't warn you again. 
You're on an island here. 
There's no way out. 
They'll find you. 
Yes, they will. 
Soon enough. 
Damn it. They've made us. He's breaking left. 
I repeat: he's breaking left. 
Chloe, have you got them? 
Can you see where they're going? 
Checking. 
What's happening? Why did he turn? 
He's in a parking garage. 
 It extends across the block.   How many exits? 
 Only two.   Okay, he's going to have 
to double back. Where's the other exit? 
 Broadway.   I'll cover that. 
Cole, I want you to pull your team back from the ambush point. 
 Cover the block.   You got it. 
All teams, pull back and reposition. 
Set a perimeter around the parking garage between 158th and 159th. 
I've got him. 
He's going back into the garage. 
Copy that. All units converging on your destination. 
He's just moving deeper into the structure. 
He's got no place else to go, Jack. You got him. 
Where did they go? 
Inside the structure. 
He's running for the roof. 
Move! Move! 
Where the hell is he going? 
Coming straight at me! 
Damn it! 
Chloe, we got any movement from the target vehicle? 
No. No one could survive that. 
Chloe, Hassan is not in the vehicle. 
You know where to go. 
 What if he comes to?   He won't. 
Not before you deliver him. Go! 
I said go! 
Yeah. 
Hey, it's me. 
Have you got Hassan? 
No. We set up our ambush. 
We were seconds away from taking him down, when out of nowhere, the driver deviated from his route. 
He managed to transfer Hassan to another vehicle before I could get to him. 
Someone inside CTU has got to be tipping them off. 
How is that possible? 
I don't know, but I've got the driver's cell phone. 
Soon as we can set up an uplink, I'll be able to figure out who it is. 
I'm on my way to CTU. 
 Do you want me to talk to Chloe?   Yeah, but no one else. 
Tell her we need a secure area to run the uplink. 
 Get back to me as soon as you're ready.   Okay. 
We need to search the parking structure. 
He switched cars. 
All units, grid search on the parking structure now. 
All right, let's move. 
Done & Corrected by N!L!0 
Hassan isn't happy about Taylor's response to the ultimatum. 
If he wants to take it up with President Taylor, he can do it when he's... 
 Put your gun down.   Omar, what are you doing? 
Mr. President... 
My life for tens of thousands? 
I couldn't live with that. 
What if they blow up the bomb anyway? 
At least I've tried to stop the attack. 
We've got less than five minutes... we gotta move. 
Mr. President, you can't trust him! 
Don't move, hands where we can see them! 
Is he still alive? 
Yes, ma'am. 
Where is President Hassan? 
I don't know. 
Don't lie to me! 
They have Hassan; we have the bomb. 
The bomb's at Amsterdam and 93rd. 
We know that President Hassan was handed over approximately ten minutes ago. 
We have an ambush point yet? 
Yes, intersection of 161st and Amsterdam. 
CTU is following you. 
Can you find me an exit? 
There's one between 158th and 159th... parking garage. 
Damn it, they've made us! 
He's breaking left! I repeat, he's breaking left! 
I've got him, he's going back into the garage. 
He's coming straight at me, damn it! 
You know where to go. 
 Have you got Hassan?   No. 
The driver managed to transfer Hassan to another vehicle before I could get to him. 
Someone inside CTU's gotta be tipping them off. 
It's only a matter of time before this gets traced back to me. 
I need you to get the hell out of here while I still can. 
Uh, excuse me, Ms. Walsh? 
I need to see your passkey. 
What's this about? 
It's a new security protocol because of the EMP attack. 
Nobody gets in or out without personally being cleared by Mr. Hastings. 
I can't let you through. 
You haven't been coded out. 
Well, I'm not leaving. 
I'm just going to my car. 
I'm sorry, you'll have to talk to Mr. Hastings. 
Hastings is in the middle of a crisis. 
It'll just be a couple minutes. 
No one will even know I was gone. 
Look... 
I just want to go get my migraine meds. 
Please don't make me beg. 
All right, tell you what, I'll have one of my men run out to your car, grab your medication. 
Give me your keys. 
You know, that's fine, your men are busy enough. 
I'll talk to Hastings. 
 You sure?   Yep.  
Thank you, Jim. 
Only one car left the parking garage. 
One minute after the crash. 
Northeast exit, a blonde woman was driving. 
Hassan was probably in it. 
Can you track it? 
No, it left the satellite grid. 
Damn it. Put out an APB on that car. 
 Yes, sir.   Scan the NSA servers. 
 See if they've picked up any chatter.   Yes, sir. 
Mr. Hastings, the President's on line one, 
 she'd like an update.   Great, thank you. 
Madam President, Brian Hastings. 
Mr. Hastings, I saw the crash. 
Please tell me President Hassan survived. 
Actually, we just learned that President Hassan was not in the vehicle. 
I don't understand. 
During the pursuit, we believe he was switched to another car. 
We're trying to track it now. 
 Then he's still alive.   It appears so, ma'am. 
If the terrorists wanted him dead, they would've killed him on site. 
They must have another agenda. 
I don't even want to speculate on what that might be. 
We will keep you apprised, Madam President. 
Thank you. 
What is happening? 
Is my father alive? 
We think so, but he's still in the hands of the terrorists. Now, CTU 
 is searching for him now.   Then there's still hope. 
 Yes.   Excuse me... 
but Madam President, the Russian Foreign Minister is outside. 
He wants to speak with you. 
I'll be right there. 
I can't imagine how hard this is for both of you. 
Please know that I'm committing every resource at my disposal to finding him. 
Mr. Novakovich. 
What can I do for you? 
Thank you for seeing me, Madam President. 
I know that you are very busy. 
It's all right. 
Please. 
Can I assume there is no change in the status of President Hassan? 
I'm afraid not. 
Then he is still being held by terrorists. 
For now, yes. 
Are you hopeful that CTU can recover him? 
We're following a lead now, and, yes, we are very hopeful. 
What is the nature of the lead? 
I'd rather not get into specifics. 
You'll be told the second we know more. 
Madam President, I need to stress that if Hassan is not found, his government will be in disarray. 
The peace agreement will have no chance of success. 
I'm aware of that, but there's, there's no point in speculating on the worst-case scenario; we're not there yet. 
I just want to make our position clear. 
If Hassan dies, there is no agreement. 
If I didn't know better, I'd think you were hoping for that to happen. 
 Madam President!   You believe this treaty 
weakens your influence in the region. 
Your country has been looking for any excuse to pull out. 
I realize you are under a great deal of pressure, but there is no reason for these baseless accusations. 
My country has been more than supportive. 
We are here, are we not? 
Perhaps I spoke too harshly. 
I just don't need you to remind me how perilous this situation is. 
I do appreciate your support, and I hope that I can count on it until we find President Hassan. 
Of course, Madam President. 
Chloe, can I talk to you for a second? 
We've got a problem. 
Jack thinks that someone inside of CTU is working for the terrorists. 
Why does he think that? 
They must've been warned that they were being followed. 
That's why they transferred Hassan to a different car. 
Yeah, that bothered me too. 
And then there was a satellite glitch that happened earlier. 
What glitch? The glitch that allowed 
the terrorists to get away in the first place. 
It was a little too unlucky; especially for us. 
Jack recovered Tarin's cell phone from the crash. 
If someone did call to tip him off, we can get the number off the memory. 
Jack's on his way back to CTU now. 
He wants you to call him on a proprietary line so he can upload the data. 
 All right.   Go. 
I'm ready to receive. 
I'm calling Jack now. 
This is Bauer. 
Jack, it's Chloe, Renee filled me in. 
Good, I'm going to upload the cell phone data to your station. 
 What's your I.D. number?   91770. 
91770. 
Chloe, it's encrypted... you're gonna have to work fast. 
Excuse me, sir, I need to access your workstation. 
What for? 
I want to make sure all the parameters reset properly  after the EMP.   Can't that wait? 
No... if the parameters are off we could lose more data. 
 How long?   Couple minutes. 
Go ahead. 
Hastings. 
Mr. Hastings, it's Chloe. 
I need to talk to you at my station... it's important. 
What is it, Chloe? 
I'll explain when you get here. 
I'm on my way. 
Let me know when you're finished. 
All right, what is it? 
We think someone inside of CTU is working with the terrorists. 
What are you talking about? 
They switched Hassan to a different car because they knew they were being followed. 
Jack recovered Tarin's cell phone from the crash. 
Chloe's decrypting the data right now. 
Who the hell is it? 
The data's coming in now; it'll take a second. 
Okay, there... these are all the calls 
that Tarin made in the past hour. 
That's one of ours. 
It's one of the cell phones NSA provided to us right after the EMP hit. 
Who was issued that phone? 
They were logged in by hand; hold on. 
That's Dana's phone. 
Where is she? 
I checked with Hastings; he cleared me through, Jim. 
How's that migraine? 
Worse than ever, thanks to you. 
Sorry about that. Just doing my job. 
Stay where you are and keep your hands... 
Security monitors, main screen. 
We need a medical team to the main entrance. 
What's going on? 
Why is there a 112 out on Dana? 
She's working with the terrorists. 
Just shot two security guards. 
She's trying to leave the building. 
Wait... wait a minute, what the hell are you talking about? 
We traced a call from her cell phone to one of the terrorists. 
She's been working with them, Cole. 
What the hell did you know about this? 
Nothing, sir! 
She just entered the parking garage. 
She's heading for the north end of level two. 
 She's going for her car.   Cole... Cole! 
Notify Security, lock down the exits. 
Get out of the car now! 
Who are you, you lying bitch? 
Who are you? 
Cole! Let her go! 
Cole, let her go. 
Cole... 
I said let her go. 
Where's Hassan? 
You're going to talk to me one way or the other. 
I said, where are they taking Hassan? 
I want to talk to Jack Bauer. 
You want answers... 
get Bauer. 
Get her out of here. 
If her name's not Dana Walsh, then who is she? 
Her real name's Jenny Scott. 
How much pain you can endure. 
At least that's what she told me. 
I don't know what to believe anymore. 
But she said she did some bad things in her past. 
That's why she had to change her identity. 
What bad things? 
She was involved with a felon. 
They committed some armed robberies. 
Someone got killed. 
That's all I know, but it's not relevant to finding Hassan. 
You let me decide what is relevant and what is not. 
Why and hell didn't you report any of this? 
Oh, I just found out about it a few hours ago. 
That is not an excuse. 
I know, sir. 
I guess I was just trying to protect her. 
I wasn't thinking straight. 
So when you and Dana... or whatever her name is... 
went AWOL, what was that about? 
It's a long story, sir, and it won't help us find President Hassan. 
I'll make a full debrief once this is all over, but until it is, please, let me stay on duty. 
I know I screwed up, but I've been running Hassan's security for the last month. 
Give me a chance to make this right. 
Hastings. 
Sir, you wanted to be told when Jack Bauer got here. 
He just arrived. 
Send him to interrogation. 
Yes, sir. 
You get over to debrief. 
Sir, you need me on this. 
I need people I can trust. 
You want to make this right? 
Then start by getting down everything you know. 
Then we'll talk. 
What's happening? 
You were right. They had someone inside of CTU. 
Dana Walsh. She's an analyst. 
We checked the phone data you sent over. 
She's the one that called Tarin before he crashed. 
She must've warned him that he was being pursued. 
Anybody know who she really is? 
She's not saying anything until she talks to you. 
Me? Why? 
She won't say. 
 Jack, are you up to speed?   Yeah. 
I just spoke with Agent Ortiz. You know he was her fiance? 
Well, that would explain a few things. 
He doesn't know much... only that she had 
some kind of criminal past, and altered her identity to infiltrate CTU. 
Not an easy task. 
Well, she obviously had help from someone. 
However she did this, we need to find out. 
You think Cole's clean? 
I think he's telling the truth, but after this, I'm not sure I trust my own opinion. I thought I knew Dana Walsh. 
Cole's clean. 
Why does she want to talk to you, Jack? 
Don't know. Just met her today. 
But I think we should find out, don't you? 
Open up. 
You stand down for now. 
Just so we're clear, as far as I'm concerned, I kept up my end of our deal. 
The nuclear rods were recovered. 
The only reason why I'm still here is because I gave President Taylor my word that I would protect President Hassan. 
I know. 
Okay, thank you. 
Biometrics ready? 
Yes, sir. 
They said I was the only one you wanted to talk to. 
Why? 
Because you're the only one here who doesn't have his head up his ass. 
So let's not waste any time. 
You want President Hassan, I can get him for you. 
I know where they're taking him. I know what they're planning 
to do. 
What do you want? 
You know the drill. 
Full immunity, clean record. 
And I want to be compensated. 
Compensated? 
When you get these IRK agents, you're gonna get your hands on their cash. 
I want my share. 
I lost a lot of money when this deal went south. 
You're telling me all of this is about money? 
Isn't it always? 
If I'm going to take this to the president, I need proof that you know something worthwhile. 
Well, in about a half an hour, you will have all the proof you need... 
Hassan's head. 
You little bitch. 
Let me explain something to you. 
Damn it, Jack! 
The only reason you've got any leverage right now is because President Hassan is alive. 
So stop screwing with me! 
They are going to force him to make a statement, and then they're going to kill him, live over the Internet. 
So I suggest we stop haggling and you start making this happen. 
Fine. I'll take this to the president. 
But you better understand that if we don't recover President Hassan alive... 
you get nothing. 
Nothing. 
It's why I asked for you, Mr. Bauer. 
It's part of the deal. 
You're going to handle this operation. 
Hassan is heavily protected. 
I need someone with your experience running the show. 
There's been enough screwups for one day... 
don't you think? 
Earlier, you said you lost a lot of money because the deal went bad. 
Who was supposed to pay you? 
Tick-tock, Mr. Bauer. 
You're running out of time. 
Open the door. 
So what do the biometrics say? 
Autonomics are stable. No deception. 
I wouldn't put much faith in those readings. 
She's a sociopath. She cannot be trusted. 
Renee's right... this isn't just about the money for her. 
She's hiding something. 
But given the timeframe that we have, we need to follow through with this. 
How do you want to play it? 
We need to call the president. 
Hassan is here. 
They're bringing him up. 
Samir, we should kill him now. 
The entire city is looking for him. 
It's not enough to kill him. 
We need him to confess his crimes, renounce his lies. 
The longer we delay, the better the chance the Americans will find him and try to rescue him. 
He will never be rescued. 
He will die right here. 
Samir? 
Do you remember me? 
I was a young man when we met. 
You were a general in the Revolutionary Guard. 
I had the honor of briefing you on our operations in Abul Province. 
You were a great leader then. 
What happened? 
Why did you turn your back on our country? 
It is you... 
you who has betrayed our country. 
No. 
I'm fighting to keep us strong. 
You have chosen to surrender to the West. 
It's not surrender. 
It's an honorable peace... that will strengthen our country. 
I do remember you. 
Do you remember the campaign we fought to secure the perimeter of Abul? 
Yes, I do. 
The other generals said I was leading my men into defeat. 
But we fought for four long days. 
I believed in my heart that victory was possible. 
And I was right. 
I'm not saying I'm never wrong. 
But I believe... 
just as strongly in this peace agreement. 
All I'm asking... 
is that you put your faith in me once again. 
I implore you to stop this madness. 
The next thing you say... 
will be an apology to every citizen of the IRK. 
You will beg forgiveness for your treason, and you will renounce the peace agreement. 
That will never happen. 
I'll never do that. 
I will never do that. 
Oh, you will. 
It just depends on how long it takes. 
This immunity agreement's made out to "Dana Walsh". 
But it's my understanding that's not her real name. 
The lawyers are aware of that, ma'am. 
They say the agreement will hold. 
Too bad. 
I thought for a moment there we had a way out. 
I'll get these to CTU right away. 
Thank you, Tim. 
Thank you. 
Ethan. 
Still here, Madam President. 
Are you going to be all right? 
I'll let my doctors field that one. 
They're running tests. 
Good. 
Madam President, what's the situation with Hassan? 
Is he safe? 
They have him, Ethan. 
The IRK agents have Hassan. 
Oh, dear God. 
They're going to kill him. 
Not if CTU can get there in time. 
There's a rescue operation underway. 
They know where he is? 
They will shortly. 
The terrorists had someone working for them inside CTU an analyst named Dana Walsh. 
I've agreed to a conditional immunity deal in exchange for her cooperation. 
Conditional on what? 
Omar Hassan's safe return. 
Ethan... there's a real possibility 
Hassan won't survive this. 
I hate to even think about it, but we have to be prepared. 
Is there any chance that the person who succeeds Hassan will be someone we can deal with? 
The IRK constitution is vague when it comes to succession of power. 
There's no telling who'd take his place. 
Besides, Hassan barely was able to form a consensus in his own administration. 
It took a man of his charisma and passion to achieve that. 
I'm sorry to be so negative, Madam President, but we have to be realistic. 
Without Hassan, there can be no peace. 
They're ready to start the briefing with Dana or whatever her name is. 
 Arlo?   Yeah. I heard you. 
You work with someone for a year, you think you know them. 
How did we all miss this? 
I always knew there was something wrong with her. 
She was a little too perfect. 
But I never imagined she'd be a terrorist. 
I should've seen it. 
She was acting weird all day. 
Maybe if I'd been looking in the right spot, like somewhere in the vicinity of her face, I might've noticed something useful. 
She played us. Get over it. 
Sit down. 
I'm only telling you this because you're going to find out soon enough. 
Dana's been given provisional immunity by the President. 
What?! 
She's providing us with intelligence as to the whereabouts of the people holding President Hassan. 
I don't care what she's providing. 
She's a traitor and a murderer! 
Cole... 
You can't let her walk! Not her! 
Stop. 
I know you've been burned professionally, personally. 
Get over it. 
Jack Bauer's heading up the operation to rescue President Hassan. 
He wants you on his team. 
But Dana is briefing the group. 
Do you have a problem with that? 
No, sir. 
I'm fine. 
Good. 
Stand by outside the conference room. 
His name is Samir Mehran. 
Before the IRK planted him here, he was a soldier with the Revolutionary Guard. 
Altogether, he has about six men left. 
You killed the rest. 
You're absolutely sure that's where they're holding Hassan? 
Yes. The entrance to the tenement 
is on Holland Avenue with exits to the rear and east side. 
He'll have at least a couple lookouts stationed. 
What's the apartment number? 
I don't know. 
What's the apartment number? 
If I knew, I would tell you. 
Somewhere above the first floor. 
What makes you say that? 
Because the building is populated. 
Some families. 
Samir will want to use them as human shields in the event of a frontal attack. 
We got what we need. 
We have to move. 
Secure the prisoner. 
Take her to holding. 
Hey. You all right? 
Yeah, I'm ready to go. 
Get your men and assemble them in the motor pool. 
Let's move. 
Let's go Just read the statement, Omar. 
Put an end to this. 
This is only going to get worse. 
Tell the people you've made a terrible mistake. 
Atone for your sins. 
You are wasting your time. 
I will never do what you ask. 
Read the statement, Omar, or I will start cutting pieces from your body. 
Whether I live... 
or I die... 
this peace will happen somehow. 
And men like you will have no place to hide. 
This peace dies right here with you! 
You said the drug would break down his resistance. 
It should be working. 
Give him another injection. 
Any more could kill him. 
I don't care. 
Do it. 
Samir, we can't continue this forever. 
If he won't read the statement, we must think of something else. 
He will break. 
I know it. 
He's stronger than we thought. 
We need to accept it. 
Stop. 
Prepare the Internet feed. 
What are you going to do? 
I will tell the world of his crimes. 
And carry out his sentence. 
Madam President, I just got word from CTU. 
Their tactical team is approaching the staging area. 
They also have real-time uplink. 
Dalia and Kayla Hassan have asked to speak with you. 
They're in the waiting area. 
I was told you found my husband. 
He's being held in an apartment building. 
CTU is preparing to go in after him. 
Do they know if he's still alive? 
We believe that he is, but we can't be sure. 
We have our best men in the field and they're going to do everything they can to save your husband's life. 
But you cannot guarantee he will be saved. 
I'm afraid not. 
But I assure you, we're going to do everything we can. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
Madam President, we need you in the situation room. 
We'll know something very soon. 
NSA just red-flagged a live feed going out on the Internet. 
It's President Hassan. 
Put it through. 
President Hassan is a traitor to his country. 
His belief that we must capitulate to the infidels nearly condemned our people to a life of subjugation. 
What follows is a list of his crimes. 
You will see that he deserves the harshest punishment. 
Hassan has tortured and sent his bulldogs on other leaders of the society The scholars... 
Does the video give us any clue to Hassan's location in the building? 
Look at the shadows behind his head. 
The light coming from the left is natural light. 
It's a window. 
You're sure that's daylight? 
Yes, the light temperature is 5,600 degrees Kelvin. 
That's the building where Dana said Hassan is being held. 
Based on the angle of the shadows, they're in an east-facing apartment. 
By the height of the surrounding buildings, they're on the fourth floor. 
Sir, the drone is in position. 
There are two lookouts on the roof. 
Patch me through to Jack. 
It's Bauer. 
Jack, we've got a good fix on Hassan's location. 
We think he's in an east facing apartment on the fourth floor. 
We also confirm two look-outs on the roof, both armed. 
 North and south corner.   Copy that. 
You need to hurry, Jack. 
The terrorist is running a live Internet feed. 
He's reading a list of Hassan's so-called crimes. 
As soon as he's done, he's going to execute him. 
We're at the staging area; I'll let you know as soon as we're moving in. 
 Is this everyone?   Yes, sir. 
Okay, Cole, I want you and your team to take down the lookouts; I want coordinated kill shots and I want you to cover the perimeter as we move in. 
Charters, Bank, you're gonna be with me. 
We're gonna use audio surveillance to locate the apartment where they're holding President Hassan. 
I want all of you to silence your weapons. 
The only way this operation works is if we take these terrorists by surprise. 
If they get a sense that we're moving in on them, President Hassan is dead. 
I don't have to tell you what we're up against, and the significance of this operation. 
Trust your training and let's get this done. 
Check your comms, we'll meet at the rally points in two minutes. 
Renee, I need to talk to you. 
I want you with me on the assault team. 
I thought you wanted me running ops. 
In order for this to work, I need every agent with experience I can get. 
But you need to understand this goes against every instinct I have. 
So you need to promise me that you'll stay right behind me and you'll do exactly as I say. 
Okay. 
 No, I need you to promise me.   I promise. 
Get ready. 
Target A acquired. 
B Target moving towards you. 
20 feet... ten feet... 
On my mark. 
Now. 
Lookouts are down, you're clear. 
CTU, we're moving in towards the building now. 
We see you, Jack. 
It has become a tool for truth-hiding, misinformation and propaganda for his regime. 
Openly supports the masked poisonous vipers of America. 
This man is not our President! 
He's an arrogant pretender who would sell our women and children to the infidels and the imperialists of the West. 
His terrible crimes against our people demand retribution! 
We're not terrorists, as President Taylor and her other rats would label us. 
Don't move. 
Federal agent. Get down on the ground now. 
Get down on the ground. 
Hastings, we just took a hostile out on the second floor. 
Are we still good to go? 
Yes, Jack, you are still good. 
Cover that, we need to move now. 
corruption and promiscuity over our country and bringing back foreign domination over the Islamic Republic of Kamistan. 
This is the dog that we sent to speak for our country. 
He's Taylor's puppet! 
we've seen in a generation. 
We could finally lay the foundation for real peace... 
He who is guilty. 
That's it, Jack. 
It's all right. 
We're not here to hurt you. 
Where's your mommy and daddy? 
Federal agent! Get on the ground now! 
One more word and I will kill you. 
On the couch now. 
Jack, looks like Samir's wrapping it up. 
You need to get in there right now! 
Today we get justice. 
Taylor and her country want to strip our nation of progress and all defense capabilities. 
She sees our great nation rising together, making strong advancement in nuclear technology. 
so much that she would charm Hassan and make him her subordinate. 
And Hassan's own greed-fueled lies and promises that he never intended to keep. 
I have a visual on Hassan. 
Ready to engage. 
You would do the same if your homes were occupied. 
We have thousands of volunteers who have promised their service and are willing to give their lives. 
No... 
No! 
All he sought to create is a hollow, soulless nation. 
You will soon hear the cry to rise up and renew. 
We will take back our country. 
Remember this day as the beginning of a revolution. 
It is the day we eliminated a tyrant. 
Hassan has torn us apart, muzzled us, divided us with his condescending peace treaty of subjugation to the Americans. 
For this treachery, the penalty is death. 
I'm sorry. 
I will carry out this sentence myself. 
The time has come for this criminal to pay for his treason. 
Our country demands justice. 
Omar Hassan shall pay with his own blood. 
Oh! 
Oh... 
Jack. 
Jack, talk to me. 
The, uh, statement was prerecorded. 
He was dead before we got here. 
Oh... 
Oh. 
Call CTU. 
I want to know what the hell went wrong. 
And clear the screens. 
We were too late. 
We weren't able to save him. 
I'm sorry. 
 No...!   I'm sorry. 
It's him. 
Damn it. 
(over headset): I couldn't get off a shot. 
Stand by. 
We'll get him on the way out. 
Manuel! 
Hey, Manny! 
Manny! 
Hey, Manny! 
WOMAN: Yes? 
Put Mauricio on the phone. 
Victor? Just put Mauricio on! 
He's dead. 
What? 
Someone shot him in the head. 
What the hell is happening? 
I see him. 
He's leaving the building. 
I'set. 
Stop. 
SPOTTER: It's not him. 
He can't be far. 
Coming at you! Gray sedan! 
Target is out of range. 
Move out. 
OPERATOR: 911. What's your emergency? 
Yes. I want to report a stolen vehicle. 
License plate SNE15C5. 
Jack? 
Oh. 
Sweetheart, we already talked about this, remember? 
You're supposed to call me "Grandpa." 
You don't look like a grandpa. 
Couldn't agree with you more. 
The cartoon I turned on is boring. 
Okay. We'll find another one. 
This is the boldest diplomatic initiative we've seen in a generation. 
It could finally lay a foundation for real peace throughout the entire region. 
Well, you know, Bob, the president's certainly betting her legacy on the success of these negotiations... 
Grandpa! 
This isn't a cartoon! 
Okay, okay. 
*A sloth of bears... âTª 
This one! I like this one! 
*A mob of cows âTª *A herd of sheep... âTª 
Yeah? 
Hi, Dad. Sorry we're late. 
They're redirecting everyone around the UN. 
It's all right. We're doing fine. 
How was the zoo? 
Well, to be honest with you, we spent most of our time just going back and forth between the black bears and the polar bears. 
I forgot to mention that she's going through a bear phase. 
Well, she certainly knows what she wants. 
She reminds me of you. 
Well, that's funny. 
I always tell Stephen how much she reminds me of you. 
Anyway, we'll be there in a few minutes. 
Okay. Don't worry. 
We'll meet you in the lobby. 
Great. 
Sounds like they had fun. 
They always do. 
What's wrong? 
We talked to him about moving to LA the night we got here. 
Yeah. He said he'd think about it. 
Yeah, and he hasn't mentioned one word about it since. 
And we leave tonight. 
Well, maybe he has to check with his doctors. 
No, they cleared him two weeks ag He's finished with treatme. 
I don't know. 
My father has been on his own for so long. 
Maybe he doesn't know how to live any other way. 
Why don't you just ask him again? 
My father is not the type of person you ask twice. 
If you want, I can do it. 
REPORTER: Here at e ited Nions, a White House spokesman just confirmed that Presiden Taylor and Hassan will be hoing a joint press conference later this hour. 
It is widely expected that President Hassan will announce the dismantling of his country's nuclear weapons program. 
esident Hassan has stated that he conside these negotiations a historic success and a new beginning for his country and the entire Mideast region. 
I believe that that is a reasonable compromise. 
Now, Mr. President, let's move 
on to the issue of verification. 
Now, the language in your latest proposal is vague. 
Let me be clear. 
My country agrees to abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons with full International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. 
But our terms, Mr. President, 
were that the inspectors themselves would be American, not IAEA. 
With respect, Madam President, your side pushed the point, but we never conceded. 
With respect, your side has refused to negotiate the point in good faith. 
Without Americans on the ground Surely, we're not going to let the nationality of a few hundred men ...verification has no teeth. 
So, only the United States can be trusted, Mr. Secretary? 
This is the message that you sent to the rest of the world and then you wonder why we don't want to negotiate. 
Farhad. 
Madam President, please excuse my brother's passion. 
He only wants what is best for our country. 
I understand. 
But we need to resolve this issue before we can move forward. 
And ideally, before the press conference, which gives us less than an hour. 
HASSAN: Madame President... 
what would your Congress say if my Revolutionary Guard was stationed on your soil? 
It's the same with my National Assembly. 
Even if I agreed to this, they would not ratify it. 
After all, I'm not a king. 
Nor I a queen. 
Too bad for both of us. 
I'd like to adjourn and discuss this issue with our respective teams. 
Of course. 
You are aware he was a salesman before entering politics. 
Household appliances. 
You want to bet he sold a lot of refrigerators? 
Find a way to give him what he wants. 
Madam President... 
You heard me. 
Try to make the inspections work. 
This man is a once in a lifetime leader. 
And he has already suspended his support for terrorist organizations, and privately, he's advocating for a two-state solution. 
How much further can we expect him to stick his neck out? 
Hey, come here. 
Did you name him yet? Bear. 
"Bear." KIM: There she is. 
Go get your mom. Hi! 
Hey! I heard that you 
and Grandpa were hanging out with the bears. 
Then we had ice cream, but I didn't like mine, so Grandpa gave me his. 
That's nice. STEPHEN: Here, I got her. 
Thanks for watching her, Jack. Of course. 
Listen, I've been thinking a lot about what we talked about. 
And I've made up my mind. 
I want to move back to Los Angeles with you. 
Really? Yeah. 
I got a friend who's got a private security firm. 
Said he'd give me some consulting work. 
He's also got a place I can rent. 
Dad, I don't know what to say. 
Come here. 
You don't have to say anything. 
Just give me a ride to the airport tonight. 
Wait, you're coming with us tonight? 
If it's okay. 
Of course. Stephen. 
Yeah? He's coming with us tonight. 
And I've just got a few more things to pack. 
I don't have very much. 
I can be at your hotel in about an hour. 
That's perfect. We can get back 
and finish packing ourselves. 
It'll be all right if I fly back to Los Angeles with you? 
Yay! Yay! 
Come on. I'll walk you to the car. 
Okay. Let's go. 
Yay! I got her. 
Okay. *We're going in the car. âTª 
Get your belt done up... 
Dad, I am so glad that you're doing this. 
Me, too. 
I love you. Love you. 
Okay, guys, I'll see you in an hour. 
TERI: Okay. Bye, sweetheart. 
TERI: Bye! 
(gasps, groans) Good afternoon, everyone. 
Good afternoon. 
All right, just a few things before we get started here. 
Presidents Taylor and Hassan will each make a statement after they've been introduced by the Secretary-General. 
The Q&A will follow, but I want you to keep your questions strictly on topic. 
For obvious reasons, we're all operating under heightened security measures, so, unless you've been dying to know what a chokehold feels like, keep your credentials visible at all times. 
All right? 
That's all for now. 
Meredith Reed, press. 
It's invalid. 
What? 
It can't be invalid. 
Can you double check? 
I did, ma'am. Your credentials 
have been revoked. 
Revoked by whom? 
I don't have that information. 
Okay, this has to be some sort of mistake. 
You do remember me. 
I've been here every day. 
Please step aside, ma'am. 
I just talked to Secretary of State Kanin. 
He's agreed to IAEAnspectors. 
That's good news. 
There is a condition attached. 
They're insisting that the head of the verification team be an American. 
I think we can live with that, don't you? 
You know where I stand. 
We've already surrendered too much in the name of peace. 
Surrender is a strong word, Farhad. 
And what have we surrendered really, apart from our nuclear ambition? 
Isn't that enough? 
Spinning 6,000 centrifuges is good for political maneuvering, but it's helping to bankrupt our country. 
The truth is, we are not the ones being so generous. 
President Taylor is lifting economic sanctions, and offering an aid package worth billions of dollars. 
We got everything we wanted, Farhad. 
As long as it's not a trick. 
Hello. 
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you 
with something so mundane, but I'm stuck outside. 
Stuck? 
My press credentials have been revoked. 
I dI'll take care of it. 
Are you sure? 
Of course. 
Thank you. 
Will you, uh, will you still have time for the interview later? 
Yes. After the press conference. 
I'm looking forward to it, Mr. President. 
So am I. 
Reinstate Miss Reed's clearance. 
I was only... 
Just do it. 
Omar, people are starting to talk about you and this reporter. 
And saying what? 
Miss Reed is a journalist and she's profiling me for her newspaper. 
But you have feelings for her. 
I'm friendly with her. 
Think whatever you like. 
This woman poses no threat to me or the peace process. 
Not here maybe, but back in our country you'll be torn apart. 
The mullahs will say that you have been corrupted by the West. 
What do you say, Farhad? 
Have I? 
Have I been corrupted by the West? 
You know I don't believe that. 
But you are married. 
Dalia hasn't been a wife to me for a long time. 
That's no excuse to be reckless. 
I've done nothing reckless. 
I've done nothing reckless. 
Just reinstate Miss Reed's clearance now. 
I'll see to it. 
Victor. 
What are you doing here? 
How the hell did you find me? 
I was always resourceful, Jack. 
That's what you liked about me. Get in here. 
Take a seat. 
What happened? 
I need help. 
You need an ambulanc No, no, don't call. 
That's what he's waiting for. 
He's listening to the emergencchannels. Who? 
Just listen to me, Jack. I have information. 
The best I can do for you, Victor, is get you an ambulance. 
I'm out. I don't work for 
the government anymore. 
Oh, this you're going to want to hear. 
Why? 
Why? Because you're the guy who 
always does the right thing. 
There's a big hit going down. 
On who? 
President Hassan at the UN. 
He's getting taken out. 
When? Today. 
Before he can sign this thing with Taylor. 
You see? I told you you'd be interested. 
How do you know this? 
I'm the one that got the hitter into the country. 
I've been setting him up with what he needs. 
And then he tried to take you out. 
Look, Jack, you're the only one at CTU I ever did business with. 
I need you to call them, vouch for me, so I can cut a deal. 
Come on, Jack. 
(groans) Keep your seat. 
Look, I swear, this is real. 
Someone is trying to make sure that this peace agreement does not happen. 
I'm not doing anything until you give me your weapon. 
Better not be screwing with me. 
I'm not. I swear, I'm not. 
Who's the hitter? What's his name? 
Who's the hitter?! 
I don't know his name. 
He's Russian or something. Not good enough. 
Who is the hitter?! Look. 
I know how to find him and stop him before he makes the hit. 
But I'm not saying another word until I make my deal. 
You're lucky I'm retired. 
This is Cole Ortiz. 
Move Singer's team to the northeast quadnt, and tell him, from now on, I want updates every quarter hour. 
Get back to me with confirmations. 
Hastings wants you to expand the patrol perimeter around the UN another quarter mile. 
I'm glad that's what he wants, but I barely have enough men to cover the perimeter now. 
I'll see if I can get NYPD to help you cover. 
Uh, Dana? 
My sister she said she lt you a couple of messages. 
Something about bridesmaids' dresses. 
I told her there was probably something wrong with your voicemail. 
I got her messages. 
I just haven't had a chance. 
These double shifts... 
I revised the patrol protocols at the UN. 
Thought you might like to take a look at it before I distributed it. Yeah. 
Yeah, I do. I will call your sister 
back, I promise. 
Thanks. 
Damn it, what is the problem? 
Percussive maintenance? 
That's what my network apps professor called it when I hit my computer. 
Can I help? 
I just got the revised attendee list for the press conference. 
I can't get the facial recognition done in time. 
Oh, you're running each person through individually. 
You can do them in a batch. 
Not if the data's in different formats. 
Well, that used to be true, but here. 
Like I said, there's no reon to be shy out asking for help. 
Okay? Don't worry. 
You'll catch u You're doing great. 
Excuse me. 
O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
Jack. 
How's Kim? Did you tell her about LA? 
Yeah, but I can't go into that right now. 
I need to speak to the director. 
Mr. Hastings is on the phone, 
and he really doesn't like to be interrupted. 
Well, tell him it's regarding a plot to assassinate President Has See if that ts his attention. 
Oh. Okay, hold on. 
All right, now, give me an overlay on the UN, view from the west. 
Now, overlay the distribution of security teams, please. 
That looks good. 
Now, give me a comp with incident reports and satellite imaging. Excuse me, Mr. Hastings. 
Gary, hold on for a second. 
Jack Bauer's on line three. He says he nds 
to talk to you. Bauer? 
It's about a plot against President Hassan. 
I thought you'd want to take the call. 
Gary, I'll call you back. 
Mr. Bauer, thiss Brn Hastgs. 
Mr. Hastings, I'm with an 
informant that I used to run who's claiming he's got intel on an assassination attempt on President Hassan. 
He says it's going to take place today. 
We've received several ats in regard to the peace conference. 
I can only imagine. 
My informant's name Victor Aruz. 
I used him in the Salazar op. 
You should be able to pull his file Pull it up. 
He's been shot in the arm he claims byhe assassin. 
Look, I don't think this is something you should take lightly. 
And what does Mr. Aruz want 
in return for his information? 
CTU protection and immunity. 
That's a lot to ask, Mr. Bauer. 
Have you pulled his file yet? 
No. JACK: Mr. Hastings, 
I know this son of a bitch, and my instinct is telling me that you need to pay attention to this. 
I need more than your instinct, Mr. Bauer. 
CTU isn't the organization you knew. 
Okay, fine, but understand this: If anything happens to President Hassan, I will be obligated to call President Taylor and tell her that I tried to provide you with this intel, and you ignored it. 
What is taking so long for the file? 
Sorry. I'm still searching 
through the archives. 
Mr. Hastings, I need your answer now. 
Are you bringing Aruz in or not? 
(sighs) Let me talk to him. 
I'll put you on speaker. 
Go ahead. 
Mr. Aruz, I'm gonna need some other details 
to corroborate your story. 
The hitter took out two of my guys. 
Manuel Escobar and Mauricio Tellez. 
Check with t cops. 
We will. 
Mr. Bauer, 
where are you? 
1145 West 18th. 
I'll send a chopper to pick you up. 
The closest helipad to you is... the 12th precinct. 
That's five blocks away. 
Can you t him there, Mr. Bauer? 
Yeah. 
I'll have a team there in 20 minutes. 
Make sure you don't use official channels. 
We believe the assassin is monitoring emergency bandwidth. 
Got it. 
Gather comm and tactical, tell them we've got a situation. 
JACK: Let's go. 
There you are. 
Now that doesn't suck. 
Arlo. 
Yeah. 
Come on. Hastings called 
an emergency briefing. 
And if he ever catches you doing that, you're gonna be out of a job. 
Be worth it. 
I think this mig be love. 
Now. 
This is CTU transferring control of drones A31 and 32 to HS aerial command. 
Yeah, roger that. 
Offload confirmed. 
l right, we've got a situation. 
Cole, I need you to scramble a chopper for a pickup. 
Yeah. I haven't finished distributing 
the new patrol parameters. 
This is a priority. 
Who am I picking up? 
Someone who claims to have intel about a threat to President Hassan. 
How good is the intel? 
Well, according to Jack Bauer, very. 
Jack Bauer? 
He's delivering the informant. 
Who is Jack Bauer? 
Location downtown; Chloe's sending you the coordinates. 
Take a small team with you. 
Torres' people are free. 
Yes, sir. And I'll need a second 
team to secure the landing. 
One team will be enough. We'll use a drone 
to protect the ground operation. 
Arlo, scramble a drone alongside the chopper. 
Full spectrum coverage of the landing zone as well as the air corridor. 
Done. 
We're clear. 
Dispatch, this is Unit 2354. 
DISPATCH: Go ahead, 2354. 
Got a plate match on a stolen vehicle. 
(various overlapping radio communications) (tuning in):...03 Pontiac. 
Plate: Sierra, November, Echo, one, five, Charlie, five. 
Got bullet holes in the windshield and body. 
That's him. 
DISPATCH: Roger that. 
What's yr location? 
Vee's parked o18th, just west of Ninth Avenue. 
We'll take care of it. 
Will you? 
Or am I going to have to step in? 
Now would be the time to tell me. 
Aruz is a dead man, sir. 
You have my word. 
Good. 
Thank you. 
Excuse me, Madam President. 
President Hassan accepted our counterproposals on inspections. 
That is great news. 
By the end of this next session, we may have a signed agreement. 
It's an extraordinary accomplishment, Allison. 
(sighing) Is something wrong? 
I was thinking about Henry. 
Achieving a comprehensive peace agreement with the Islamic Republic was was something that he and I talked about years ago. 
I wish that he were here to share the moment. 
You surprised? 
Considering his behavior during the divorce, yes, I am surprised. 
He went out of his way to hurt you, especially in the press. 
He was angry, Ethan. 
I sent our daughter to prison. 
You refused to cover up a murder. 
Olivia was responsible for what happened no one else. 
Still, if the the situation had been reversed, I might've felt the same way as Henry. 
Sorry if I'm interrupting, but I just talked to Brian Hastings at CTU. 
What's going on, Rob? 
They have someone who claims he's got information about an assassination plot on Hassan. 
How real is the threat? 
Real enough to loop you in. 
This informant came to them through Jack Bauer. 
I thought that Jack was out of all of this. 
How did he get involved? 
As far as I can tell, this informant came to him. 
We'll know more once the informant signs an immunity deal, provided you authorize it. 
How secure is the venue for the press conference? 
Very. And I just raised the alert level. 
But we need to set up a call to inform Hassan about the threat, ideally before the conference gets started. 
We can't tell Hassan. 
Certainly not before the press conference. 
Why not? 
Well, he might scuttle everything, out of concern for his own safety. Hassan's a big boy. 
He's used to taking risks or he wouldn't be here; you know that. 
Plus, if Hassan finds out we knew about this and didn't tell him, then all the trust we've built up over the last year goes out the window, and then he'll pull out of talks. 
And frankly, I wouldn't blame him. 
I'll think about it. 
Thank you both. 
Madam President, I'm telling you, holding this back from Hassan could be disastrous. 
I said I'd think about it, Rob. 
Thank you. 
Ethan... 
Listen-- sorry if I went after you a little hard in there. 
Uh, I was just making my point. 
No need to apologize, Rob. 
I recommended you to the President because you're not afraid to speak up. 
She needs that. 
Yeah, well, still, I know I can get carried away; I... 
Don't worry, kid... I ain't dead yet. 
I can handle mysf. 
Even up against you. 
Hey, sweetheart, it's me. 
Hey, we're almost finished packing. 
Are you on your way? 
Something came up. 
I'm gonna be a little late. 
How late? 
I think I should meet you at the airpo. 
Is everything okay? 
Yeah. 
Are you sure? 
Kim, I promise everything's fine. 
Well, Teri is so excited that you're coming back with us. 
Just, uh, let me know when you're on your way. 
Okay, thanks, sweetheart. 
Keep your eyes open. 
The precinct's two blocks away. 
Let's cut through here. Come on. 
The FAA's cleared a route and informed all relevant agencies that we will be in the air. 
Good luck. 
Aruz's file-- it was in a proprietary database. 
That's why it took so long. 
Still, that shouldn't have thrown you you've been here a month. 
Almost a month, and I've had to relearn the interface on every major system here; everything's changed. 
And you're having trouble adapting, I understand. 
But I don't think it's a question of your intelligence. 
Thanks. 
I think it's ambivalence. 
Ambivalence?! 
I know the only reason you only took this job was because your husband was downsized. 
Am I wrong? No! 
I mean, yes. 
Please, just give me a little more time to get up to speed here. 
Mr. Hastings, I need this job. 
Fair enough. 
But I'm all about efficiency, so if your performance doesn't improve, you may want to rethink working here. 
Now, I trust this has been clarifying. 
Sure. 
If you really wanted to be more efficient, why don't you just say if I don't catch up soon, I'm going to be fired? 
Your flight path is a straight shot southwest over the river, and the 12th Precinct has confirmed that their helipad is clear and operational. 
Comm net and satellite coverage of your flight, both legs, and fulltime aerial from the drone Why are you looking at me like that? 
Like what? 
Look, I just want to make sure nothing's wrong. 
Nothing's wrong, like I said. 
Just be careful, okay? 
I will be. 
You ready? 
Yeah. 
You know, maybe she should finally set a date. 
She's getting cold feet. 
How about you shut up and just focus on your assignment? 
Come on, Victor! 
Victor? Victor! 
Stay with me. 
Victor, stay with me! 
Stay with... 
Damn it. 
Stay with me! 
We're going to need to recompress the wound. 
TV REPORTER: If successful, the agreement could be the beginning of a real lasting peace in a lon g-troubled region. 
Presidents Taylor and Hassan are scheduled to give their first joint press conference in just a few minutes, and we'll carry that live. 
In a moment, Christiane Doumany will have a report on the history of the many failed attempts at a Mideast peace, and why this accord may be different. 
It's time to go. 
Tell your father I'll be right there. 
I'll wait until you're done. 
He doesn't trust me to be on time. 
Of course he trusts you. 
When did you become such a good liar? 
You don't have to defend your father, Dalia. 
He can take care of himself. 
You look beautiful, Dalia. 
And you look handsome. 
Let's not pretend any more than we have to. 
I'm sorry you had to see that. 
It's not your fault. 
My dear Kayla. 
We should go. 
Yes. 
Let her through. 
Thank you. 
I will tell you the same thing that I told him. 
Unless you want to destroy everything that he's worked for, stay away from him. 
Excuse me, ma'am. 
President Hassan is on his way. 
You're not going to tell him he's being targeted. 
Madam President, I'm sorry. 
You risk destroying in a single day all the-- Rob, you've made your point. 
More than once. 
And believe me, I don't like keeping this from President Hassan any more than you do. 
Then tell him. 
Mr. President. 
Ladies. 
You've met my chief of staff? 
Of course. 
Hello, Mr. President. 
I haven't had the chance to thank you for compromising on the verification issue. 
It was the right thing to do. 
If you don't mind, I'd like to brief you both on the format of the press conference. 
The Secretary-General will be introducing you both after some brief remarks. 
The conference itself shouldn't take any longer than 25 minutes or so. 
Put your hand on it. 
Let's go. 
We're almost there. 
MAN: Don't move! 
Got a call that you two are having a problem down here. What's up? 
Officer, my name is Jack Bauer. 
I'm transporting this man on behalf of CTU. 
He's an informant vital to national security. 
Call it in. Listen to me. 
The men that are trying to kill him are monitoring all emergency channels. 
Do not let him make that call. 
Shut up and get against the Dumpster. 
Now! 
At least take us into the precinct. 
We can verify everything there. 
Get down, now! 
Damn it! 
I'm going to cover you. 
Make a run for the door. 
You ready? Go! Go! 
I'm out of bullets. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
How far out is the helicopter? 
Two minutes. Jack, what's wrong? 
We're under attack. 
I need you to put me in touch with whoever's in command of that unit. 
Okay. It's Agent Ortiz. 
He's the head of field ops. 
Is there a problem? Yes. 
Mr. Hastings, we have a 
situation with the pickup. 
Keep going to the roof. Now. 
Don't stop for anything. 
Keep going. 
Agent Ortiz, you're on with Jack Bauer. ORTIZ: Roger. 
What's going on, Mr. Bauer? 
We're being pursued by two shooters. 
There's no way we're going to make the precinct. 
We're in a building on West 21st, three doors in from Ninth Avenue. 
We're heaWe're lookingposition for an alternate pickup.ne. 
Copy that. 
Right there-- the roof of that parking structure might work. 
Can you zoom in closer? 
The satellite's refreshing. 
It'll take a minute. 
I'm moving the drone there now. 
There's a parking structure next to the building you're in. 
Roof looks clear to land. 
DANA: Did you get that, Cole? 
Yeah, I see it. Mr. Bauer, 
looks like you can access that roof from the eighth floor of the building you're in. 
How far out are you? 90 seconds. 
Copy that. 
Don't be late. 
Victor... Victor, listen to me. 
You got to tell me everything you know about the hitter, so I can call it in in case we don't make it. 
If I don't make it, I don't care what happens. 
Get me to CTU. 
You always were a son of a bitch. 
Come on. 
Come on. 
Let's go. 
Stay there. 
Lock down access points to the roof! 
Where are the hostiles? They're dead. 
You need to get him out of here. 
He's losing a lot of blood. 
Cole Ortiz. It's an honor to meet you. 
Thanks for doing this. 
Look, Hastings wants to debrief you back at CTU. 
I'm not going back to CTU. 
I delivered him, I'm done. 
No, Mr. Bauer... I got a flight to catch. 
That's it? 
Get down! 
Ortiz, report in. 
CHLOE: Agent Ortiz? 
Agent Ortiz, what's your status? 
Agent Ortiz? 
Jack, come in. 
Jack, can you hear me? 
Anyone, come in. 
Victor. 
Victor, Victor, come on. 
Stay with me, stay with me. 
Listen to me. 
You don't want to die like this. 
Do the right thing. 
Tell me what you know. 
The hitter has someone on the inside. 
Close to Hassan. 
Give me a name Give me a name. Give me a name! 
Victor... 
Victor, who's on the inside? 
Victor! 
Come on. 
Come on, come on. 
No. 
He's dead. 
No. 
The brother revoked my clearance, but I had Hassan reinstate it. 
No, I know. 
I know I'm behind schedule. 
But it'll get done. 
There's an irk splinter cell trying to smuggle weapons-Grade Uranium into the city. 
Just read the threat assessment. 
Look, i need you to shut down all bridge and tunnel traffic Into the city.

All of our systems are down. 
It's a real mess. 
Where's jack?

Once you acquire jack's position, You can direct me to him. 
I have a faster way to get us back on line. 
They won't listen.

I hope that you're here to help, because we can damn well use it. 
You going in through the clr processor? 
That's right. We're gonna 
create a brand-New subnet. 
That'll take forever. 
I think i can create a workaround. 
Why not tap directly into the trunk line? 
What i'm suggesting will be a lot faster. 
I'm here to clean up your mess. 
You need to leave. 
You get out. 
Get out! 
We got power to comm.

It'll be short work Once we get the rods across the river.

They'll be fine. 
I can't know if the ribs Are broken without an x-Ray. 
You should see a doctor. 
Any more stress could cause the lung to collapse. 
Trust me, they're not broken. Thanks. 
Renee: are you sure you're okay? 
Fine. 
Where are we at with the fuel rods? 
We found the zodiac partly submerged In the river near 11th street, empty. 
The rods are in manhattan, jack. 
It's not over yet. 
Ctu doesn't think we're more than a few minutes behind. 
Who's running the ground op? Cole? 
Yeah. 
Okay, i want you to contact chloe. 
Get her to download archival photos from 11th and the river. 
Have her date 'em back 15 minutes. 
Fire it up. I want you ready 
to go as soon as We've got a target. 
Sir, just spoke to a witness who said he saw four men Unloading the contents of a metal crate into a yellow cab. 
He didn't get a plate. 
Chloe, can we roll back satellite? 
We can now. Nsa 
just rerouted them. 
I'm logging onto their server now. 
This is from one minute ago. 
I'm rolling back in 30 second increments. 
This is from six minutes ago. 
Find them in real time, chloe. 
Arlo, alert nypd. Dana? 
Right here, sir. 
Contact hazmat And nest teams, get them mobilized. 
Right on that. 
Almost there, sir. 
okay, i'm live. 
Suspects are proceeding west on 14th street. 
Cole did you get that? 
Yes, sir. 
On the move. 
they've located you on satellite. 
How far away are they? 
Not very. Hold on. 
Arlo: nypd confirms they have units on the way. 
Hastings: how far out? 
Ten blocks Coming from the north. 
Head to the south. 
Turn left. 
Suspect just turned south on seventh. 
Got it. 
I hear sirens. 
Hurry up. 
Just a second. 
I'm inserting the machine code now. 
Just get ready. 
Satellite will be disabled for 30 seconds. 
On my mark. 
Go. 
What happened? 
The trunk line just went out. 
Get it back! 
Cole, we just lost picture. 
Last known location Seventh and waverly. 
Copy that. 
Where are you now? 
On the hudson, heading uptown again. 
You'll run into ninth avenue. 
You'll be able to blend into cab traffic there. 
Back up. 
Cab's gone. 
Find it! 
Scanning. 
Arlo, help me widen the grid. 
You take west of seventh, i'll take east. 
Widening it now. 
anything? 
Not yet. 
You, chloe? 
No. We were out for 30 seconds. 
They could be anywhere. 
Cole, we're back up, but we lost them. 
I'll have nypd cordon off the area. 
You have them check Every garage, warehouse, loading dock. 
They must have pulled in somewhere. 
Yes, sir. 
Get me the president. 
Are we clear? 
Yes. 
Good. We're moving 
the weapon into place As soon as it is assembled. 
I need you to send me nypd patrol patterns and checkpoints. 
As soon as it's safe. 
That's not good enough. 
I need them now. 
My instructions were to help you, Not jeopardize my cover. 
I will call you back when i can. 
Madam president, i'm afraid i have bad news. 
Despite our best efforts, The terrorists have gotten the nuclear rods into manhattan. 
How good is your intelligence? 
Are you sure? 
We are, sir. 
In fact we had a visual on the suspects Until a few moments ago. 
What happened? 
We lost them. 
We're launching a multiagency search In the area we think they're in. 
That you think they're in? 
Will you be able to find them, or not? 
We're doing everything in our power, mr. Kanin, 
But right now i don't have an answer for you. 
Madam president, i'm sorry to have to tell you this... 
I can no longer guarantee the safety of manhattan. 
How the hell could this happen?! 
Ctu had one priority: to make sure this didn't happen! 
It's unacceptable! 
Mr. Hastings, i want you 
to consider the entire resources Of the government at your disposal. 
Whatever help you need, we must find those rods. 
I understand, madam president. 
We also need to prepare for the worst. 
I want all branches of local law enforcement ready To respond to an imminent radiological attack. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Ethan, set up a situation room And assemble the national security team. 
Has president hassan Been evacuated from the un yet? 
He will be shortly, but as of right now, He's still at the un. 
Get me jack bauer. 
Yeah, but how long was the satellite was down? 
What, 30 seconds? 
Yeah. I know what 
you're thinking, jack. 
Odd we lost the feed just as we were closing in on the target. 
Who was running point at ctu? 
Chloe o'brian. 
You know her from before, right? 
yes. 
And you trust her? 
With my life. 
Mr. Bauer, i have 
president taylor for you. 
Cole, i've got to call you back. 
I got the white house on the line. 
Hello? 
Jack, it's president taylor. 
I'm calling to ask you a favor. 
Anything, ma'am. 
President hassan and his family are being evacuated From the un and brought here, and i would like For you to supervise that operation. 
With all due respect, madam president, I think i'd be much more helpful staying in place Here with ctu. Besides, 
Secret service is more than capable. 
Well, that may be true, but i'd feel a lot better Knowing you were on the job. 
Jack, in light of the threat to new york, President hassan's role In securing a lasting peace is more crucial than ever. 
I need him safe. 
I understand, ma'am. 
I'll leave for the un immediately. 
Thank you, jack. 
I'll see you when you get here. 
Yes, ma'am. 
She wants me to supervise hassan's evac To mcguire air force base. 
All right, let's go. 
Renee. 
Renee, i need to do this on my own. 
We're not going through this again. 
I'm coming with you, end of discussion. 
Do you have the rods? 
In the trunk. 
Where is ali? 
He didn't make it. 
I'm sorry. 
Tarin will take his place as driver. 
How long before the device is functional? 
All we have to do is load in the fuel rods. 
Tarin. 
Get ready to leave. 
I want to place the bomb As soon after i talk to the president as possible. 
agent o'connor. 
Jack bauer. 
I know who you are, sir. 
I've been briefed by command at mcguire. 
Ms. Walker. 
Agent o'connor. 
We're cleared for a subterranean evacuation. 
The feeling is that president hassan Will be safer underground in the event Of a radiological attack. 
Agreed. 
How many agents? 
There are seven secret service, Including myself, two of hassan's internal security, And now you and ms. Walker. 
What's the time frame? 
Ten minutes. 
There's a service tunnel that runs parallel To the path lines leading into new jersey. 
We're just waiting on the vehicles now. 
I'd like to see the exact route. 
Of course. 
I have the maps and evac protocols In the conference room, But president hassan is asking to see you first. 
He's in the council chamber. 
Fine. You two get started. 
I'll be right back. 
Excuse me. 
Sir. 
Mr. Bauer. 
President taylor wanted me to supervise The evacuation of you and your family To mcguire air force base. 
So i'm told. 
And i'm glad for it. 
How long will it take for you And your family to be ready? 
We're ready now. 
My wife and daughter are in the residence Awaiting your instructions. 
Give us ten minutes And then we'll evacuate you and your family Through a service tunnel under the building And straight on to new jersey. 
And here i thought i would be leaving the united nations today At the head of a peace march down fifth avenue. 
My president still thinks that might happen, sir. 
I hope she's right, mr. Bauer. 
Me, too, mr. President. 
Give us ten minutes. 
We need to talk about a response, madam president. 
I've prepared three Retaliatory strike scenarios Against targets inside the irk. 
do i need to remind you, General brucker, the islamic republic Is an ally? 
You don't. 
But what good is an ally If its citizens can Attack us on their own? 
Madam president, A call's come into the white house switchboard From a man claiming to be in possession of the nuclear rods. 
He wants to talk to you. 
Do we believe he's who he says he is? 
Confidence is high, ma'am. 
He's offered details Of recent events that no civilian could know, plus he's On an anonymous icc channel that's scrambled And impossible to trace. 
Put him on speaker. 
This is president taylor. 
Good morning, madam president. 
This is going to be a short conversation. 
Who are you and what do you want? 
You know i have the fuel rods. 
You know i got them into manhattan. 
What i want now is to convince you That i have no desire to harm innocent americans. 
And yet you're threatening them with a bomb. 
Actually, a radiological dispersal device, Madam president, capable of contaminating 40 square blocks under a dense radiation cloud. 
Any attack on the united states Will prompt a retaliation against your country. 
I would expect nothing less. 
But you should listen to me. 
What i'm asking for is simple. 
Turn over president hassan. 
What? 
He's a traitor to his people and must stand trial For his crimes. 
That will never happen. 
You have exactly one hour to change your mind. 
Mr. Woods knows 
how to contact me. 
Madam president... 
The clock starts now. 
40 squares blocks How many people is that? 
Between a 100,000 and 150,000. 
Rob, inform Ctu of the threat, but the ransom demand Stays in this room. 
Tim, call up the new york guard To support first responders, And have the military police execute An evacuation plan. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Madam president? 
What is it, rob? 
Well, i'm just going to say it. 
We should consider the alternative. 
What alternative? 
We have an out here. 
I think we should take it. 
You mean, give in He demand to turn over President hassan? 
No one man Is worth the lives of tens of thousands. 
And you know what? I bet 
He would agree. 
Madam president, are we really having This conversation? 
Doesn't it Deserve a conversation? 
Not unless you're intent on destroying Our moral authority. 
This country's unique place among nations, maybe forever. 
As opposed to what? 
The irradiation Of all those people? 
Real businesses, real homes Uninhabitable for a hundred years or more? 
Madam president, I agree. 
Giving up hassan is wrong, But a 40-Block wasteland at the heart of new york city Is unthinkable. 
This country would never be the same. 
The country would Crucify us if word ever got out That this could have been avoided. 
Now we're talking politics, for god's sake? 
We're talking about the primary role of government Any government-- Which is To protect its citizens. 
It could also escalate, Madam president. 
They attack us, We attack them back. 
The entire region could be drawn into the conflict And destabilized. 
Excuse me, general, But weren't you the one just advocating For a retaliatory strike? 
Well, in the military, We like to talk about facts on the ground. 
Well, they have changed, madam president. 
Now, we have a viable option. 
Viable? 
Is that the sense in the room then? 
That surrendering President hassan is somehow viable? 
In the first place, The people who are offering us this deal cannot be trusted. 
How do we know they won't detonate the bomb anyway? 
Secondly, president hassan Is a guest of this country. 
He is my partner in peace. 
And i will not sell him out To the very terrorists that we are determined To defeat. 
And finally, Caving to any terrorist demand Weakens this nation immeasurably. 
Now, we have 60 minutes To find these bastards. 
And i believe we will. 
But if we don't, and the worst happens, We will deal with it. 
We will pick ourselves up off the floor and deal with it. 
Why? Because that's what 
we do. 
Americans don't stay down. 
We rise up together in times of crisis. 
We carry on. 
Is that clear? 
Start the calls, tim. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Chloe, i need an updated list Of road closures and checkpoints. 
I thought arlo was interfacing with nypd. 
He is, but national guard units are on their way, So are teams from fbi new jersey. 
I want to know where the holes are, so i can plug them. 
I'll forward it to your screen now. 
Thank you. 
yes? 
It's me. 
Do you have the roadblock information? 
I'll have it for you in five minutes. 
Did you speak to president taylor? 
I did. 
Her response was as i anticipated. 
But as the time pressure builds, she'll change her mind And give up hassan. 
I'm certain of it. 
What if she doesn't? 
Then we'll strike a hard blow against the city. 
Either way, the peace process dies. 
It's ready. 
I don't have time to deal with these anymore. 
Mr. Weiss? 
Can i have a word? 
Certainly. 
I thought secretary kanin's Point was a good one. 
If we simply turn hassan over, We risk damaging the good name of the united states. 
What are you suggesting? 
Uh, a third way. 
A covert action in which we Deliver hassan to the terrorists, But make it look like they took him hostage. 
Two birds, mr. Weiss. 
We spare new york And we preserve our reputation In the eyes of the world. 
I admit, i'm intrigued. 
But...? 
It'll never fly. 
You heard the president. 
She won't go for it. 
Not in a million years. 
No, of course, she won't. 
The question is, Will you? 
I'm asking For your cooperation, mr. Weiss. 
For the good of the country. 
Well, even if i agreed to help, it's too late. 
Hassan's already on his way here. 
No, it's not. A wet ops 
team was mobilized In the event of a strike against the irk. 
If you get me hassan's exact route, i can redirect them To intercept his security detail. 
I don't have access to that information. 
It's being handled through The secretary of state's office. 
Then we just have to get it from mr. Kanin. 
It's sedition, general brucker. 
Are you familiar with the fourth nuremberg principle? 
If the orders of the president Are illegal, it is our Moral obligation to disobey them. 
And you think they are? Illegal? 
The president is letting her idealism Get in the way of her responsibilities As commander in chief. 
It's hardly the same thing. 
You don't think so? 
With the fate of an american city in the balance? 
"The primary role of government is to protect Its citizens." 
Your words, mr. Weiss. 
It's time to decide whether or not you meant them. 
The white house just received credible intelligence That the terrorists we've been tracking Plan to detonate a radiological device In new york city in less than 50 minutes. 
all of us in this building have friends And family who live in the city. 
We know we are Bound by law not to warn them. 
But we also know it is still in our power to protect them. 
We are their last line of defense. 
That is our job. 
That is what we will do With every second of every minute we have left. 
Starting now. 
Go back through all your leads. 
Appeal to your sources one more time. 
Find that bomb. 
I just heard from our source inside ctu. 
Based on the roadblocks, amsterdam is closed off, But there's a potential target area just to your left. 
You'll be avoiding nypd checkpoints To the south and west. 
All right. 
Turning. 
Can you park in that block? 
Yes. 
Good. The fallout radius 
will include a good part Of the upper west side. 
I'll wait for your call. 
How many men on the detail? 
Eleven. Hassan's own security, 
secret service, And two former agents Jack bauer and renee walker. 
Why is bauer involved? 
The president trusts him. 
And believe me, he's not someone to be taken lightly. 
Oh, he's up against an elite team Who will have the advantage of surprise. 
Bauer and his people don't stand a chance. 
The loss of life is regrettable, mr. Weiss. 
No one feels this more keenly Than a soldier who's led men into battle. 
But right now, we don't have a choice. 
ethan. 
What's going on? 
Oh, i'm sorry. 
I thought you were with the president. 
I was. 
What are you doing in here? 
Oh, i asked mr. Weiss 
To pull up the latest white house readiness protocols. 
He couldn't log on from his computer, So we were trying from yours. 
I was also reviewing president hassan's itinerary To see if we could facilitate a military escort. 
Hmm. 
Open the door. 
I'm afraid i can't do that, mr. Kanin. 
Then get out of my way. 
Rob? 
Ethan, listen, i... 
No, you listen to me. 
I think i have a pretty good idea What's going on here. 
Sit down, mr. Kanin. 
There are some things you need to know. 
There sure as hell are. 
But i'll stay where i am, If you don't mind. 
Ethan, do what he says. 
Sit down, please. 
this is bauer. Go ahead. 
I said, go ahead. 
Give me your phone. 
General... 
Get your hands off of me! 
wait! 
This is beyond madness. 
The two of you will spend the rest of your lives in prison. 
Maybe, mr. Kanin. 
But my guess is that one day, The country will thank us for it. 
Rob... i'm begging you. 
Don't do this. 
Don't betray your president. 
ethan? Ethan? 
All right. 
Ethan! 
My god! Ethan! 
Ethan! 
Okay. 
Oh! 
Okay. 
Ethan, here, here, here. 
Call 911. 
We call for help, the first thing He does is get word to the president. 
But he's having a heart attack! 
We can't just do nothing! 
We didn't do nothing; you gave him his medication. 
Well, it's not working. 
Look, i realize that you two are close. 
But this is not an emotional decision, This is a tactical one. 
We wait to acquire hassan Before calling an ambulance, understand? 
What if he doesn't make it that long? 
We have to pray that he does. 
All right? 
All right. 
Come on. 
We pick up the service tunnel under third avenue. 
From there, the trip to mcguire by convoy Is less than 30 minutes. 
Thank you, ms. Walker. 
Secretary kanin, this is jack bauer. 
I can see on my phone that you just tried to call me. 
Please call me back as soon as you can. 
Thank you. 
This is bauer. Patch me through 
to mcguire air force base. 
How far are you from an access point into the tunnels? 
Uh, based on what i'm looking at, Less than two miles. 
Well, the security detail's already on the move. 
Can you get there in time? 
Yeah, if we haul ass. 
And the ambush happens where? 
At the vehicle, sir. 
Remember, the objective is president hassan. 
Do what you have to do to take him alive. 
Yes, sir. 
Good luck. 
Thank you. Have him call me back 
as soon as possible. 
renee. 
Yeah? 
Secretary kanin tried to call me. 
Now he's not answering his phone. 
The operator at mcguire air force base Can't find him either. 
Something's not right. 
Keep your eyes open. 
Hold up. 
We set? 
Yeah, the vehicles To transport the hassans are 200 meters Up the tunnel. 
There is a section Of construction we couldn't get by. 
unit one, this is mcguire. 
Your route to gate 4 has been secured. 
Did you walk it? 
Yes, sir. All clear. 
Get the family. 
This way. 
Our suvs are a short hike up the tunnel. 
Stay together as we move towards them. 
This is bauer. 
Patch me through to secretary kanin. 
here they come. 
Man 2: is hassan with them? 
Yes. 
Masks on. 
Take your positions. 
Wait until the targets are in the kill zone. 
Remember, we need to take hassan alive. 
secretary kanin? 
Just a minute. 
Yes, what is it? 
Excuse me, sir, but jack bauer's calling for secretary kanin. 
Well, the secretary is busy with me right now. 
I understand that, sir, But mr. Bauer's persisting. 
He says it's very important. 
He's holding on line one. 
All right, thank you. 
I'll take care of it. 
Jack, hi. It's rob weiss. 
sir, we're in a service tunnel under... 
I'm sorry, you're breaking up, jack. 
Can't hear you. 
I said, we're in a service tunnel under the un. 
We're evacuating president hassan and his family. 
Is everything all right? 
You tell me. 
Secretary kanin tried to get ahold of me About ten minutes ago on his private cell. 
I've been trying him ever since; he won't pick up. 
Well, the secretary's tied up With the joint chiefs right now, jack. 
Do you know what he wanted to talk to me about? 
Honestly couldn't say. 
I could've been anything. 
I don't think so. 
He knows we're conducting a sensitive evac. 
He called me during it. 
There's got to be some kind of a connection. 
Well, i'll make sure he gets the message. 
Mr. Weiss, 
I don't think you understand. 
I need to talk to secretary kanin now. 
That's not possible. 
What do you mean, it's not possible? 
We're dealing with an imminent Terrorist attack on our soil! 
Just do your job and let us do ours! 
all due respect, sir, i am doing my j... 
Hello? Hello? 
Son of a bitch just hung up on me. 
He's under a lot of stress; they all are. 
I don't give a... 
agent o'connor, stop. 
Start walking them back now. 
Something's not right. 
We're gonna head back to the un, reassess there. 
Let's go. 
President hassan, i'm very sorry, But you're too exposed down here. 
Whatever you think is right, mr. Bauer. 
They're turning around. 
How far are they? 
About a hundred yards. 
Okay, take out as many as you can. 
Renee! 
I need you to get president hassan And his family to the side tunnel and back to the un! 
What about you?! 
I'll be right behind you! 
President hassan, You need to go. 
Now. Now! 
Okay, go. 
Go, go. 
Go! Go! 
Your orders are to stay with president hassan. 
You need to go. 
I know what i have to do, sir. 
Good luck. 
Thank you, sir. 
You ready? 
I'm ready. 
Now! 
See if you can get wide and outflank them. 
I'm going to try to draw them into a crossfire. 
Shoot only on my command. 
Engage. 
Mr. President, we 
need to keep moving. 
Your people are being slaughtered, mr. Bauer. 
We need to help them. 
They're buying us the time we need. 
Don't let it be in vain. 
We need to go now! 
Give me a weapon. No. 
I've been a soldier, mr. Bauer. 
I can handle a gun. 
I'll fight with you. 
Mr. President, my job 
is to protect you. 
You need to do what i say. Now, go! 
We to keep moving. 
Come on. 
come on. We got to go. 
Renee, we're not going to make it. 
Take cover. 
Go! Go! 
I'm going to head up the middle. 
As soon as i set these off, i want you to start firing. 
Doesn't matter if you hit anything. 
Just make some noise. 
Mr. President? 
You take care of your family. 
You ready? 
Yeah. 
Let's go. 
Mathis! Donner! Go! 
Move! Move! 
Move! Move! Move! 
I'm going to take the high ground. 
In about five seconds, start giving me cover fire. 
Okay? 
Take the weapon off. 
Take the weapon off now! 
Now! 
Who are you? 
You're making a huge mistake. 
You're american. 
Why did you attack us? 
Because a dirty bomb will be detonated in new york Unless we deliver hassan to the terrorists. 
What are you talking about? 
A ransom demand has been made. 
Him for the bomb by 06:15 hours. 
Jack, that's less than 20 minutes. 
Does the president know about this? 
She's refusing to deal with the terrorists. 
This is general brucker's operation. 
Get up. Get up! 
What are you doing? 
I'm going to get you up to the street level, Where i can make a phone call. 
There's no time for that. 
This is on you now. 
You have to deliver hassan to the terrorists. 
I don't take orders from anybody But the president of the united states. Now, move. 
keep moving. 
Yes? 
Why haven't i heard from you? 
Because i don't know anything. 
What does that mean? 
Are the americans handing over hassan, or not? 
The only information we have Is that he's being transported to mcguire air force base. 
We lost communication with his security detail About 20 minutes ago. 
So president taylor doesn't intend to give him up. 
Samir... think for a minute. 
You use that bomb, you lose your leverage. 
The president leaves me no choice. 
The blood will be on her hands. 
Samir! 
tarin? 
Yes? 
The president has not responded. 
Start the countdown. 
You need to stay with the bomb. 
Make sure no one interferes with it. 
Tarin, did you hear me? 
Yes, i heard you. 
Your name will never be forgotten, my friend. 
Your family will be honored above all others. 
Let's get the other body and get cleaned up before we head back to CTU. 
I'm trying to locate an individual by the name of Kevin Wade. 
Kevin's probation officer just called me. 
He has records that show him calling my cell several times. 
Look, you just have to handle this, okay? 
I don't know if I can do this. 
Lie. Come on, we both 
know you're good at it. 
Put your hands where I can see them! 
Do not move! 
Samir, Marcos is out of the chamber. 
Hang up right now and transmit the fail safe! 
What's happening? What is that? 
! Marcos, I don't know 
if I'm gonna be able to do this in time. 
How were they gonna smuggle the fuel rods into the city past the radiological detectors? 
I don't know! 
Damn it, Marcos, give me a name! 
President Hassan's head of security, Tarin Faroush. 
Right now you need to call UN Security and have them take Mr. Faroush into custody 
until we get there. 
Tarin's not here. Where is he? 
I don't know. 
Somewhere with my daughter. 
Tarin is working with your father's enemies. 
You must tell me where you are. 
The Teodore Hotel, Suite 514. 
Just stay where you are. 
The police will be there shortly. 
I thought we agreed you weren't gonna take your mother's call. 
I'm sorry, my love, I just didn't want her to worry. 
Did you tell her where we are? 
Of course not. 
We're arriving at the landing now. 
Soon we'll be able to transport the rods into Manhattan. 
Are CTU's radiation sensors down? 
Not yet, but we'll be ready. 
All right, listen up! 
This is what we know. 
IRK nationalists are targeting New York with a dirty bomb. 
We have one lead: Hassan's former head of security, Tarin Faroush. 
We believe he wants to disable our defenses so they can smuggle the bomb into Manhattan. 
Chloe? 
Latest intel is that Tarin is staying at the Teodore Hotel with President Hassan's daughter, Kayla. 
Kayla has been warned by her mother that Tarin is working with the terrorists. 
She'll be trying to keep him at the hotel until our Tac teams arrive. 
What's our ETA othat? 
NYPD is approaching the staging area, CTU still ten minutes out. 
Chloe, you liaise with NYPD. 
Actually, Dana is better at the inter-agency protocols than I am. 
Fine. 
Jack Bauer's heading Field Ops, Dana's on point with NYPD, Arlo will run aerial. 
Let's get to it. 
All the changes going on around here, who do I report to exactly, you or Dana? 
What does it matter? 
I just like to be clear. 
The only thing you need to be clear about is that there's a dirty bomb about to go off in Manhattan, so just do your job. 
Drone's in position over the Teodore Hotel awaiting your instructions. 
Kayla, we have to go. 
Nearly ready. 
What was that? Are you all right? 
It was nothing, I'm fine. 
Hello? 
The Americans got Marcos to talk. 
He may have compromised you. 
Did the girl receive any phone calls? 
Yes, one- her mother. Get out now. 
And bring her with you. 
We're moving to the next phase. 
I'll need a vehicle. 
Hamid is on his way. 
Kayla, we must go now. 
Just one more minute. 
Hurry up, please. 
Jack, I'm uploading Tarin Faroush's file to you now. 
Copy that. 
Okay, I've got it. 
We're also gonna need hotel schematics and access to their security systems. 
Coming to you now. 
Target is in room 514. 
Hotel security is standing by to give NYPD access. 
Jack, Brian Hastings. 
What's your ETA? 
About eight minutes. 
Can you patch me through to our point man at NYPD? 
We're doing that now. 
Name's, uh, Sergeant Amis. 
Sergeant Amis, Dana Walsh, CTU. 
Been waiting on you, Ms. Walsh. 
We're in our staging area already. 
Go ahead, Jack. 
Sergeant Amis, Jack Bauer. 
Our target, Tarin Faroush, is in room 514. 
He has a female hostage, Kayla Hassan. 
She's the daughter of President Hassan of the IRK. 
We'll handle him, Mr. Bauer. 
We'll make sure that girl doesn't come to any harm. 
The priority is to take Tarin alive. 
He's our only lead to a major terrorist threat against New York. 
Like I said, we'll handle him. 
Sergeant, don't underestimate this man. 
He was President Hassan's head of security. 
He knows what he's doing. 
I want your men to set up a perimeter and wait for us. 
We're monitoring hotel security. 
We'll give you a heads-up if we've got any action from the room. 
Kayla, my friend from the State Department is waiting for us! We must go now. 
Just one more second, please. 
Kayla! 
Kayla! 
Tarin, what are you doing?! 
Stop this game. 
We walk out of here right now. 
No, I'm not going anywhere. 
Just move! Oh, no! 
Where are you taking me? 
Believe me, the last thing I want to do is hurt you, but I will. 
Got movement on the fifth floor. 
Are you getting this, Jack? 
Yeah, someone must've tipped him off. Sergeant? 
Yes, I know, target's on the move. 
I'm going in. 
Negative. We're five minutes out. 
I want you to hold your position. 
I'm on the ground, Mr. 
Bauer; it's my call. 
No, it isn't, this is a CTU operation. 
I am telling you to hold your position. 
I'm going in. Sergeant! 
Tarin's at the elevators. 
Lost picture on the fifth. 
Sergeant, target has taken out elevator security camera and is armed. 
I am ordering you to stand down. 
I'm right on him. 
Sergeant, that was an order! 
Sergeant Amis, can you hear me? 
Ser- Chloe, have you got anything!? 
Nothing. 
OFFICER Shots fired, shots fired. 
We have shots fired. 
All NYPD units report status. 
Repeat, report status. 
This is Faulkner. I'm hit. 
Amis and Martin are down. 
Where's the target? 
He's heading toward the fire escape on the south side. 
He's got the girl. 
ESU, this is Agent Ortiz. 
Cover the south fire escape now! 
Medics, men down on the fifth floor. 
That doesn't make sense. 
What do you mean? 
Tarin just took out three men. 
Why's he using the fire escape? 
He should be heading down the stairs. 
Son of a bitch. 
NYPD, target is impersonating an officer; he has the girl. 
I want you to fall back and cover all exits. 
I repeat, target is impersonating an officer. 
Cover all exits! 
Chloe, do you see anything? 
Nothing. 
Send us back the drone feed. 
Roger that. 
Drop the gun! 
Put it down! No, no! 
Drop it now! This is Bellow. 
Target's at the Allen Street exit. 
He's got the girl. 
Chloe, we need that drone feed. 
Coming through. 
There's a cab pulling up. 
Officer Bellow, behind you! 
They're heading for the cab. 
All ESU, we have two officers down in the alley behind the hotel. 
Target is moving to Allen Street. 
He's escaping in the yellow cab. 
Tracking the cab. 
Go! 
Advise all NYPD mobile units, we cannot lose that vehicle. 
On it. Taxi's in the 
Delancey underpass. 
I'm blind. Do we have traffic cams? 
Not in the underpass. 
We're two blocks from Delancey. 
Any sign of the cab? 
Still in the underpass. 
The underpass is less than half a click. 
Where the hell are they? 
NYPD mobile units, 90 seconds out. 
Go left, Jack, go left right here! 
There it is. I got the cab. 
I got the cab. 
Driver! 
I want you to slowly open your door! 
Open the door now! 
It's empty. 
It's empty! 
Chloe, backtrack drone footage. 
Trace every vehicle that left the underpass. 
Get NYPD to set roadblocks. 
They were here less than 30 seconds ago! 
Arlo? Got it. 
We should join the sweep. 
No, they're gone. 
You don't know that. 
Yeah, I do, they're gone. 
Chloe, it's Jack, I'm gonna need a kidnap and an electronic intercept package. 
Have it meet me back at the UN. Copy. 
I need to talk to President Hassan. 
That's who the terrorists are gonna want to contact next. 
That's why they kidnapped his daughter. 
Tarin just called. 
He has the girl. 
Hello. 
Ahman. Samir, 
where are the nuclear rods? 
They're still outside the city. 
We haven't disabled the American radiological detectors yet. 
Then how will you bring the rods to me? 
It's been taken care of. 
Here, Mr. Prady. Thank you. 
Give me one moment. Yeah. 
We've backtracked through drone and traffic cam footage looking for Kayla and Tarin. 
Nothing's come up yet. 
What's Bauer's status? 
He's two minutes from the UN. 
An electronic intercept team is en route to him. 
Keep me informed. 
Copy. 
Ms. Walsh. 
There's a Mr. 
Prady here to see you. 
Says he spoke to you on the phone. 
Thank you. 
Chloe. 
Would you mind covering for me for a few minutes? 
Mr. Prady. 
Dana Walsh. A pleasure, Ms. Walsh. 
It'll be quieter in here. 
Mm-hmm. 
Uh, this is, uh... 
this is some impressive facility. 
What, uh... 
what is it you do here? 
Intelligence analyst. 
Mr. Prady, we've got a 
major situation here... 
I understand. I won't 
take up much of your time. 
Okay. 
It's 3:00 in the morning, you're 2,000 miles from home. 
You mind telling me what's so urgent? 
Yeah. It's about the young man 
I mentioned on the phone Kevin Wade. 
This is him right here. 
You know him, don't you? 
Yes. 
I should have been honest with you on the phone. 
I met Kevin a couple days ago at a bar. 
Was there another man with him? 
He was traveling with an ex-con named Nick Coughlin. 
Bad news. 
Done time on robbery, attempted murder. 
No. No, I've never seen him. 
Okay. 
So, what happened... 
with you and Kevin? 
Um... 
we talked for a while. 
I drank more than I should, and we ended up back in his van. 
You had sex with him. 
Yes. 
Do you know where he is now? 
No. I didn't see him again. 
The whole thing was a mistake. 
Why so? 
Because I am getting married in a few weeks. 
It was the pressure. 
I- I don't know. 
All the wedding plans. 
I went out for a drink. 
I didn't intend to... 
Maybe I did. I don't know. 
I don't know anything anymore. 
All that I know is that if my fiancÃfÂ© finds out, he will never forgive me. 
I'm not looking to ruin your life. 
I just want to retrieve Kevin before he gets in more trouble than violating his parole. 
I understand. 
I... I hope that you find him. 
Yeah, thing is, Miss Walsh, I got a call a couple hours ago from my NYPD friend, Tom Hardiman. 
Seems like there was a... 
a break-in at a police evidence lockup. 
Again, bad business. 
Officer got beaten up, left in a coma, but guess whose prints were on the assault weapon? 
Yeah, that nasty SOB, Nick Coughlin. 
Now, what I'm afraid of is... 
where Nick is, Kevin is, too, and I really need to find him. 
And, like I told you, I only saw him the once. 
I have no idea where he is. 
And you're sure about that? 
Mr. Prady, we are in the middle 
of a national security crisis. 
I have to go back to my desk. 
Okay. Okay. 
I'm sorry. 
Perhaps, if I talk to your supervisor, he could let you take a few minutes off. 
Or I could wait here, stay out of your way till you have some time. 
Fine. 
You have to stay here, though. 
Of course. 
Okay. Mm-hmm. 
I don't understand. 
The Americans knew where Kayla was. 
How did they lose her? 
Before we blame them, remember... 
it was our people our own people who kidnapped Kayla, not the Americans. 
Mr. President, CTU is here. 
Mr. President, I'm Jack Bauer. 
You already know Cole Ortiz. 
We deeply regret not being able to find your daughter, but I promise you, we're going to do everything in our power to recover her. 
How did you lose her? 
How did that happen? 
Tarin had been warned, ma'am. 
We arrived too late. 
It was your people... 
Dalia, please. 
What do they want with Kayla? 
We were hoping you could tell us, sir. 
Tarin Faroush was your head of security, meaning he knows everything that you know. 
He took your daughter because he's trying to leverage something from you. 
Do you have any idea what that could be? 
I don't know. 
Sir, we believe the kidnappers will contact you directly. 
We need to set up monitoring devices on your phones so we can track their call. 
Do what you need to do. 
Just, please, get our child back. 
Dalia. 
Please. 
Thank you. 
With me. 
Set up tech here. 
Tarin! Don't. 
Please. 
Don't. Come on. 
Please. 
Do what he says, and you won't get hurt. 
Who is he? 
Another traitor? 
The only traitor is your father. 
Tie her up. 
No. 
No. No. No. 
Do you recognize the number? 
There isn't one. 
Chloe, we've got a call coming in on the mother's cell phone. 
We're working on it. 
Answer it. 
Keep them on the phone as long as possible. 
Yes? 
Your husband is a traitor to the people of the Republic. 
He alone has made our actions necessary. 
He cannot be trusted. 
Where is my daughter? 
I want to talk to her. 
Whether you ever see her again depends on what your husband does right now. 
Put him on. Dalia? 
They want to talk to you. 
Here, give me the phone. 
We need to be hearing this. 
We're still working on it, Jack. 
Okay, we've got it. 
You should have audio. 
This is President Hassan. 
Who are you? 
I'm a loyal servant of the Republic you are trying to destroy. 
Now, shut up, Omar, and listen. 
I want to lk to my daughter. 
Let me tell you what I want. 
File 33. 
File 33. 
That is the price of your daughter. 
I don't know what that is. 
You had to say that. 
Of course. 
You're a vain man, concerned about appearances, and the Americans are listening. 
But please... 
do not insult me by saying this again. 
I won't say anything until I talk to my daughter. 
Fine. 
If that's what you want. 
I'm sending you an IP address. 
Give it to one of the people listening in. 
Okay, got it. 
Don't hurt her. 
It's me you want. 
I told you what I want. 
File 33. 
I told you I don't know what that is. 
Take me instead. 
You have 15 minutes. 
No excuses, no stalling. 
15 minutes or she dies here, like this, while you watch. 
Stop it. 
Stop it! 
I'll find the file. Whatever it is, 
I'll get it for you! 
Mr. President, 
what is File 33? 
Omar! Mr. Bauer, 
I've got Brian Hastings on the line. 
Yeah. 
Jack, you know anything about this file? 
No, but I'm standing here with President Hassan. 
I'll put you on speaker. 
Go ahead. 
Mr. President, 
this is Brian Hastings. 
I have no intel on the file they're talking about. 
Can you tell me what this is? 
Sir, they gave you 15 minutes. 
If you want to see your daughter again, you don't have time to waste. 
Omar, what is this file? 
Show them. 
Show them! 
Dalia, I'll do anything for Kayla. 
I would give my own life. 
Then give them this file. 
Sir? 
Put it up on the screen, mirror it over to CTU. 
Hastings, are you seeing this? 
Yes, I am. 
Mr. President, 
this file appears to contain operational details of all U.S. anti-nuclear defenses. 
That's correct. 
Including our radiological detection arrays. 
This is highly classified DOD material. 
I need to know how you got this. 
How do you think, Mr. Hastings? 
For 20 years, your nation has threatened mine with everything from economic sanctions to military attack. 
So we gathered intelligence and found weaknesses in your defenses. 
We did what any other country would do. 
Mr. President, 
that file shows the fatal flaws of our nuclear detection capabilities. 
If the terrorists were to get that, they could smuggle the fuel rods into Manhattan. 
Surely you understand, we cannot let you give that to them. 
We're talking about the lives of tens of thousands of people. 
And what of my daughter? 
What of her life? 
With all due respect, madam, your family brought this threat to my country. 
We're doing the best we can. 
Jack, you still on? 
Yeah, we all are. 
Jack, we may have a lead on the daughter's location. 
Arlo isolated a subway noise from the video feed at the end of the transmission, cross-referencing it with the real-time train positions as of this moment. 
There aren't a lot of trains this late at night, especially within the radius that they could have traveled to. They were 
heading southeast when they left the hotel. 
They've got to be near the F train stop by the Williamsburg Bridge. 
Copy that. Cole and I 
will head down there now. 
We'll bring Tac from here. 
You need me to send a second team? 
Yes, and aerial. 
Everything you've got. 
Have your men ready and assembled in five minutes. Right away. 
Mr. President, we're going 
to need you to stall them when they call back. How? 
We'll set up a fake file that you can transmit. 
They'll see through that, Mr. Bauer. 
Eventually, but right now we just need you to stall them long enough so we can locate your daughter. 
Stall them any way you can, but you need to make this work. 
We will do whatever we have to. 
Thank you. 
Tarin. 
Please, don't say... 
Why are you doing this? Please. 
Why are you doing this? 
Please don't say anything more. 
Please. 
Is there trouble? No. 
Why would there be? 
What's the problem? 
They're never going to hand over that file. 
They have to. And if they don't?! 
Killing her was not part of the plan. 
You were willing to die in Hassan's limousine earlier today. 
You were willing to do anything for our cause. 
I still am. 
You assured me your feelings for this girl would not get in the way. 
So tell me, do I need someone else to take care of her? 
No. 
Stay strong. 
We're almost there. 
Arlo, what's the status on our target area? 
Still looking at almost six square blocks. 
How far out are Jack and Cole? 
Six minutes. 
That leaves us about 30 seconds to find her. 
We've got to narrow this down. 
Where's the second Tac team? 
Leaving now. 
Uh... Dana? 
Huh? 
Who is that? 
Nobody. 
Mr. Prady, this is a secure area. 
If you're not gonna wait in holding, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. I'm sorry. 
I had a question. 
And I'm in the middle of a situation. 
I don't have time. 
Well, I wouldn't be bothering you, but I just got off the phone with my NYPD friend. 
He said I absolutely have to ask you about the security cameras at the police evidence lockup. 
Because you know what? 
It turns out they malfunctioned for the exact duration of the incident. 
Well, somebody obviously disabled the cameras. 
Well, yeah, but not Nick and Kevin. 
I mean, a crowbar is about as high-tech as those two get. 
Now, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. 
See, I'm thinking that someone must have helped them. 
Now, my friend says that all the raw video from every government facility feeds right here into CTU. 
Am I understanding that right? 
Yes. He also said 
correct me if I'm wrong- that the digital images are archived every eight hours, and metadata is that what it's called, metadata? 
that allows you to trace the exact source of any service outage. 
So, everything I need to solve this is right here. 
You can get it for me, right? 
Mr. Prady, we don't just give 
data to people off the street. 
Well, now, that's right. 
That's right. 
You need, uh, an IDRAN- an Interagency Data Request Authorization Number. 
Yeah, Hardiman gave me one of those. 
He said everything should fit on a 100-gig thumb drive. 
So is that going to be a problem, getting that for me? 
No. 
Good. 
They reprocessed the subway noise, managed to narrow down the search grid. 
How big? 
About 12 buildings total. 
Apartments, offices, retail. 
It's still too much ground to cover. 
Agent Ortiz. 
Dana? 
Cole... it's over. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm not sure I heard you. 
The parole officer looking for Kevin is here at CTU. 
Knows about the robbery, the cameras, everything. 
Are you certain? 
Yeah. 
He's after the raw feeds. 
He's got an interagency request. 
I'm going to give it to him, Cole. 
I'm sorry to call you. 
I just thought that you should know. 
Why don't you wait? 
Do you hear me? 
He knows everything. 
He'll go to Hastings. 
Don't do anything. 
We'll talk about it when I get back. 
I can't wait. 
If you're here, you'll just get in more trouble trying to protect me. 
I can't let that happen. 
I love you, Cole. 
Dana? Dana? 
You got a problem? No. 
Good, 'cause I need you to keep your head in this. 
You understand? 
You got it. 
Omar. 
We're running out of time. 
The technicians have prepared the file I'll be sending. 
But these people who have Kayla they won't believe a fake file. 
No. 
But they might believe you. 
You have a gift, Omar. 
When you talk, people listen. 
You need to convince them, for our daughter. 
Say whatever you need to to buy time. 
I have seen you move so many people. 
You can do this. 
I know it. 
Yeah. 
Mr. President? 
I'm sorry. 
It's time. 
The deadline is here. 
Your father has not responded. 
You hate him that much, you would do this to me? 
Tarin... 
I don't want to die. 
Please. 
Then let us pray for once your father does the right thing. 
Tarin, you can't let them do this. 
I know you. 
Shh. 
This is not you. 
And I know in my heart that you love me. 
In my heart I know. 
And so I don't understand why... 
Nearly there, sir. 
Okay, the uplink's ready. 
Let's go. 
Stop them! 
W- Wait, wait, wait. 
Follow me. 
This way, come on. 
My father will help us. 
He's surrounded by traitors. 
We have to get to CTU. 
Here, the number is in this cell phone. 
Call them. 
Tarin, no, no! 
Tarin, no! 
Tarin! 
No. 
Tarin! 
Omar, what has happened to her? 
Did the Americans stop the call? 
I don't know. 
Maybe they were afraid we'd hand over the real file. 
They could have gotten our daughter killed. 
Why aren't we seeing anything? 
We're not sure. 
Arlo's been scanning the audio source. 
Four minutes ago there was a spike very faint sounded like a gunshot. 
Did Jack hear anything? 
No, but he's still a quarter of a mile out. 
Mr. Hastings, you better take this. 
It's Kayla Hassan- she's in a car, she's escaped. 
What? 
Go. 
Ms. Hassan, Brian Hastings, 
Director of CTU. 
You all right? No, no, 
I'm not all right. 
I'm driving. 
They might be chasing me, I don't know. 
Where are you? I don't know! 
Track her cell phone; patch Jack in. 
Ms. Hassan, we're tracking 
your cell phone right now. 
Do not turn it off. 
Just tell us what happened. 
They tried to kill me, but Tarin got me out. 
He found a car, but they caught us. 
They shot him. 
He's dead. 
He told me to call CTU, that it was the only safe place. 
Ms. Hassan, my name is Jack Bauer. 
We need to know where you were being held. 
I don't know. 
Ma'am, look, I know you've been through a great ordeal, but please, this is very important. 
Can you at least try to remember what the building looked like? 
It was dark, and it was empty. 
It-It had a vault, like a bank, but abandoned. 
Chloe, did you get that? 
Got it. 
You need to tell my father that Tarin Faroush helped me escape, that he sacrificed his life for me. 
We've got the location, Jack. 
Republic Commerce Bank, 9621 East Broadway. 
It closed a year ago. 
It's the only bank on the grid. Copy that. 
We're going to need drone support, and send a second team over to the bank. 
We got 'em. 
Ms. Hassan, we've got you on 
First Avenue and East Fifth. 
Continue going straight, I will tell you when to turn. 
Okay. 
You two cover this exit. 
When the second team gets here, you send them down. 
Cole, you're with me. 
Let's take the door. 
Cole. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
We're in the basement of the bank. 
There's some kind of tunnel system. 
I've got the schematics, I'm seeing it now. 
We're going to head down a spur southeast from the vault. 
How many exit points? 
Two exits- no, three. 
Have the drone cover all the exit points. 
Arlo, I'm sending you my screen now. 
Can you get eyes on all the exits? 
Yeah, ascending to 5,000. 
I got movement at the south exit. 
I've got four hostiles approaching Division Street on foot, heading northeast. 
You copy? Yeah. 
Cole, they double-backed up top. 
Chloe, we're moving to intercept. 
Where's Kayla? She's approaching 
the tunnel entrance now; she'll be with us in two minutes. 
Security is standing by. 
Good work, people. 
Dana... 
good work. 
Thank you, sir. 
If you'll excuse me for a few minutes... 
Targets are heading north on Orchard. 
Okay, they're getting into an SUV, Jack. 
Do you copy? Yeah. 
Just stay with them, we'll follow. 
Owen, King, you're coming with us. 
You take King's vehicle, you two double-back around Orchard. 
Chloe, I've got a shot here for facial recognition. 
Send it to me. 
It's Tarin Faroush. 
He's supposed to be dead. 
Kayla said they shot him. 
You did the right thing, Tarin. 
I know. 
She will die for a good cause. 
Jack, Cole, come in. 
Go ahead, Chloe. 
We ID'd one of the targets. 
It's Tarin Faroush. 
Kayla said he sacrificed himself to save her, but he's still alive. 
Are you absolutely sure? 
Yes. 
What the hell's going on? 
The terrorists asked us to give them a file they knew we would never give them. 
They never expected us to. 
Chloe, you got to put Hastings on now. 
I'm on, Jack. 
You cannot let Kayla Hassan in. 
The terrorists faked her escape. 
They wanted to get her to CTU. 
For what purpose? 
What's the best way to disarm New York's radiological defenses? 
Taking out CTU. 
There's got to be something in the car, some kind of a bomb. 
You need to stop her now. 
Where is she? 
Oh, my God. 
She's in the tunnel. 
Security! 
Security! 
Dana, with me! 
Chloe, the car that Tarin got into, where is it now? 
Crossing into Brooklyn, taking the first exit off the Williamsburg Bridge. 
We cannot lose that car, do you understand me? 
Copy. 
Stop the car! 
Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
Put your hands where we can see them! 
Dana, call the bomb squad! 
Get out of the car! 
Take her. 
Bomb squad to the tunnel entrance. 
Get her away from here. 
Hastings, have you stopped that car? 
Not in time, Jack. 
Hold on, just hold on. 
It's an EMP. 
It's an EMP! 
You need to shut down your systems to protect the drones. 
There's no time, Jack. 
Get away from the car! 
I can move it. 
Come on, get out of there! 
Get out of there! 
Chloe, can you hear me? 
Those drones right now are our only way of tracking down those terrorists. 
You need to pass them off to the NSA. 
Damn it, we're blind. 
Chloe, did you cop... Chloe?! 
What the hell is happening? 
We need to contact NSA. 
The terrorists just took out CTU. 
Mr. Bauer, you are ordered 
to turn the aircraft around and return to CTU. 
Jack's descending. 
Air Force choppers are in pursuit. 
We've lost him. 
If Jack gets this evidence and exposes the Russians, the agreement is over. 
The peace agreement may not be the only casualty. 
You covered up the Russians' involvement. 
That's grounds for impeachment. 
There's still a chance that CTU will find Jack. 
Even if they do, the evidence is still out there. 
Eventually, it will surface. 
You need to control the evidence by keeping Walsh off the grid. 
Classify her as an enemy combatant and incarcerate her in a private facility. 
I've authorized a private interrogation team to acquire the evidence. 
Once we have it, she'll be irrelevant. 
I can't be a part of this any longer. 
Cite my health as the reason for my resignation. 
The president's ordered your transfer to an off-site facility. 
What do you mean off-site facility? 
It's a secure location. 
Just do what he says, Dana. 
Chloe, don't let them do this. 
 Let's go. 
 Please. 
They're gonna kill me. Chloe! 
Chloe, please! 
You told Bauer you have evidence. 
I have got nothing to tell you. 
There is no evidence. 
The sooner you tell me, the easier it'll go. 
No! 
Mobilizing a sting operation to be led by Agent Ortiz. 
The target is Jack Bauer. 
Put your weapons down! 
I can't do that, Jack! 
Put your weapons down now! 
I need you to help me gain access to Dana Walsh. 
I am giving you an opportunity to make this right, to make the people that are responsible for everything that happened today accountable. 
Chloe said she's in a safe house a few miles from here. 
All right, now it's imperative that they think I took you hostage. 
Get up! 
And though fate has prevented my husband from being here today at the culmination of his life's work, I know that he is watching us now, looking down and guiding us as we take the last steps towards this historic agreement. 
Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to President Taylor... 
Whose integrity and moral courage have been unshakable during the long course of these negotiations. 
She is someone on whom my husband built an absolute trust. 
And I want to make it clear that her efforts and the efforts of the United States government to rescue him were nothing short of heroic. 
My husband wasn't perfect. 
None of us is. 
But he carried a perfect idea in his heart: That peace is possible. 
On this, the last day of his life, may the world come together and prove that he was right. 
What a magnificent woman. 
Okay. 
Who was that on the phone? 
Bledsoe. 
It's not the best of news, sir. 
Dana Walsh isn't being as cooperative as he'd hoped. 
Well, what does he expect? 
She's a trained enemy agent; she's not gonna to break at the drop of a hat. 
Look, I told President Taylor what might be necessary, and she signed off on it. 
Bledsoe's a professional, sir. 
I'm confident he'll come through for us. 
He better. 
Sir, there was one more thing. 
Bledsoe wanted confirmation. 
About what? 
How to deal with Ms. Walsh, 
post interrogation. 
I thought we settled that matter. 
We did. 
So why's he asking? 
Just to double check we're still committed to the same outcome. 
And what did you tell him? 
We're still committed to the same outcome. 
Not that I have any idea what you're talking about. 
You understand? 
Perfectly, sir. 
Let her up. 
I'll give you a little tip. 
Take short, shallow breaths. 
You'll recover faster. 
And then we won't have so much downtime between sessions. 
It's up to you, you know. 
You can stop this whenever you want. 
All you have to do is tell me what I want to know. 
I told you that I was making it up. 
There is no evidence. 
You told Jack Bauer you had proof that elements in the Russian government were behind the assassination of President Hassan. 
I was bluffing. 
Stalling for time. 
There isn't any proof. 
Don't lie to me. 
I'm not lying. 
We begin again in ten seconds. 
Seven, six... 
Bring it on, you son of a bitch. 
Put her down. 
Where's the evidence? 
Go to hell. 
Gag her. 
* * Okay. 
They got two sentries out in front in a black sedan, one lookout on the roof, most likely another across the street, but I couldn't see him. 
We can access the back of the building through that alley. 
So, once we get Dana, what then? 
As painful as it is, we got to cut a deal in exchange for the evidence. 
You mean let her go. 
Cole, we both lost friends today. 
And Dana had a hand in that, but only a hand. 
If we can get the people in charge, the people that gave the orders, it'll be worth it. 
It's Chloe. 
Answer it. 
Otherwise, she'll know something's wrong. 
If she doesn't already. 
Hello. 
Cole, what's your ETA? 
Ten minutes. 
FDR Drive was a mess. 
We're coming up First Ave instead. 
Is Jack with you? 
Yeah, I got him. 
He's locked down in the back. 
I'm glad we found him before he got hurt. 
Or worse. 
Yeah. 
I've known Jack for a long time, and I've never seen him like this. 
He threatened me; he's never done that before. 
You did the right thing, Chloe. 
Thanks for saying that. 
I'll talk to you when you get here. 
Yeah. 
We're good. 
She has no idea. 
Don't be too hard on her, Jack. 
She was only doing what she thought was best for you. 
I know. 
Almost forgot. 
You're gonna need these. 
I'm sorry, I just couldn't take the chance. 
Son of a bitch. 
Yeah, I know. 
You ready? 
Yeah. 
Let's go. 
Keep your head down. 
Go. 
That's right, four hours prior to the signing ceremony, all available field units will be redeployed to the U.N. 
Mobile HQ is being set up on the first floor, adjacent to the high commissioner's offices. 
Hold on a second; I got O'Brian on the other line. 
Yeah? 
Who's the psych officer on duty? 
That would be Melissa Anderson. 
She did all the grief counseling last night. 
Make sure she's the first person Jack sees when he gets here. 
I want a complete eval. 
You really think that's necessary? 
I wouldn't have ordered it if I didn't. 
I'll let her know. 
I got a visual. 
They got one man on the roof. 
Okay. 
Wait till I get into position, then you draw them out. 
All units, this is Command. 
Please report. 
Command, this is unit one. 
All clear. 
Unit two. Street's clear. 
Unit three. Back alley's clear. 
Command, this is unit four. 
Roof's clear. 
All units, copy that. 
Stay alert. 
We're clear. 
Let's go. 
* * * * * * You make that cover. 
I'll draw him out. 
Command, I'm taking sniper fire on the roof. 
The building across the street. 
I need backup now. 
Unit four, stand by. 
I'm sending backup now. 
Copy that. Hurry! 
All units to the roof. 
Unit four is reporting sniper fire. 
Repeat: all units to the roof. 
Unit four is under sniper fire. 
Go. 
Go. 
Command, we're on the roof. 
It's quiet; there's no sign of Mullins. 
Come again? 
All's quiet, but we can locate Unit four. 
Unit four, come in, please. 
Where's Dana Walsh? 
Where is she? 
Command, Mullins is down, sir. 
Last chance. 
Repeat: Mullins is down. 
First room on the left. 
Thank you. 
Command, do you copy? 
Command, come in. 
We're clear. 
The first room on the left, I've got it. 
Put your gun down now! 
No, you drop your weapon or I'll put a bullet in her brain! 
I don't want to kill you, but I will if I have to. 
Put your gun down! 
You won't take the shot. 
It's too risky. 
I'll kill her before... 
Cole, untie her. 
Cole, now! 
Take her out the back. 
We're gonna get company soon. 
Hurry! 
Cole, have you got her?! 
Almost! 
I got her! 
Move! Move! 
Stay covered. 
Cole, take the stairs now! 
Jack! 
Get going! 
I'll be right behind you! 
Chloe. 
In a second. 
Just finishing rescanning the field reports. 
You need to hear this, Chloe. 
Agent Beck just checked in from the laundry. 
He said he's been locked down for the past half hour, and only just now managed to free himself. 
What? Apparently, Jack 
didn't fall for the trap. 
Instead, he reversed the entire squad and took Cole hostage. 
I just talked to Cole. 
Beck says Jack had him at gunpoint. 
Devin, pull up the satellite on the lower East Side. 
Address: 14633 12th Street. 
It's where the private contractors are holding Dana. 
It's where Jack's on his way to now. 
What is going on, Chloe? 
He's been two steps ahead of me the whole time. 
He probably knew what I was gonna do before I did. 
Hello, everybody! 
Can I have your attention, please? 
Jack Bauer's no longer in custody of CTU. 
Agent Cole Ortiz is with him, most likely as a hostage. 
Our priority is to find them now. 
Satellite's online, Ms. O'Brian. 
Put it up. 
We're too late. 
Put the APB back out on Jack, all agencies. 
Get me the White House. 
Where are we going? 
You tell me. You said 
you had a video file implicating people inside the Russian government who are responsible for Renee's murder. 
I want that file. 
And I said I'd give it to you in exchange for immunity. 
That deal's off the table. 
The president decided the peace agreement's more important than the truth. 
As far as she's concerned, that file can never see the light of day. 
But I still want it. 
What's the new deal? 
You give us the file, we let you go. 
Go where, Riker's Island? 
Dana, you're a small fish in all of this. 
I'm going after the people who gave the orders. 
You give me the evidence, we'll let you go. 
I give you my word. 
Your word? 
I'm sorry. 
I don't believe you, Jack. 
Fine. 
You think this is a joke? 
We'll do it another way. 
Get out. Get out! 
Jack! 
Jack, Cole! 
Oh! 
Tell me where that file is-- now! 
That file's the only thing keeping me alive! 
No, right now I'm the only thing keeping you alive. 
I'm gonna count backwards from three, and then I'm gonna kill you. 
Three! You're really not 
gonna let him shoot me in cold blood, are you, Cole? 
Two! 
Jack! 
Back off! 
One! 
In a safety-deposit box! 
Where? 
First Unity Savings. 
Cole knows. 
We have a joint account there. 
But the box is in my name, which means I'm the only one who can access it. 
Where's the bank? 
Lexington, off East 59th. 
I had nothing to do with Renee's death, Jack. 
I didn't even know she was a target. 
Put her in the car. 
I was in a CTU holding cell! 
Put her back in the car! 
Damn it! You see what's 
happening here, don't you? 
He's using you. 
Using me? You're using me. 
What do you think he's gonna do once I give him that file? 
He's gonna give the evidence to the press and expose everyone responsible. 
Is that what you think? 
'Cause I doubt that's what Jack thinks. 
He's gonna assemble the evidence, make a list of the guilty, and then he's gonna execute them one by one, starting with me. 
This isn't about the truth, Cole. 
It's about revenge! 
Cole! 
Look, I can't do this! 
She's just trying to get inside your head. 
I know that, damn it! 
You got something you want to say to me, you better say it now. 
Were you gonna pull that trigger? 
I need her to think I would. 
Yeah, okay. 
Mrs. Hassan, please 
allow me to offer my condolences for your loss. 
Your husband was a great man. 
Thank you. 
How has news of his death been received back in the Islamic Republic? 
And do people there generally support your decision to take his place as head of state? 
I'm confident that most of my country is behind me. 
Those who aren't, probably never supported my husband's policies in the first place. 
And what are your plans after the treaty is signed? 
Right now, I'm concentrating all my efforts on the pursuit of finishing what my husband started with this agreement. 
But I want to return to Kamistan. 
Is this true? 
I'm afraid so, ma'am. 
The details are sketchy, but as of 15 minutes ago, Jack Bauer stormed the safe house, overwhelmed security and took Dana Walsh. 
Do we have any idea where they are? 
A hard target search is under way. 
Your note also mentioned Charles Logan. 
Yes, ma'am. He's been calling 
and demanding to speak to you. 
He insisted that I interrupt the press conference. 
All you'll have to do is hit redial. 
Thank you, Tim. 
Excuse me. 
Yes, ma'am. 
...the body be ritually washed 
and draped... 
Hello? 
How in God's name could this have happened?! 
Madam President, the important thing is not to panic. 
You assured me that Dana Walsh would be more secure in the hands of your private contractors. 
We didn't move her out of CTU solely for security reasons, as I'm sure you remember. 
Do you have me on speaker, Charles? 
Pick up the damn phone. 
Forgive me, I wasn't thinking. 
Apparently, neither was I. 
It's a little late for buyer's remorse, Madam President, especially because I was calling with a solution to our current problem. 
Bauer may have Walsh, but he can't have the evidence yet. 
We've still got a chance to stop him. 
How? 
By putting somebody inside CTU, someone whose loyalties aren't split, who won't hesitate to see the mission through no matter what the cost. 
I've already replaced one director. 
I can't replace another. 
No, not a new director. 
Just someone to supervise the manhunt for Bauer. 
I'm recommending Jason Pillar. 
Your aide? 
He's Bureau-trained, Madam President. 
He was second in command at DIA during the Daniels' Administration and he made a name for himself in Afghanistan, chasing high-value targets behind enemy lines. 
Of course if you have a better idea, I'll gladly take a step back. 
Madam President. 
Just a second. 
What is it, Susan? 
Mrs. Hassan is finishing up. 
I'm on my way. 
Look, I'll tell Tim Woods that I support you making an operational change. 
But that's it, Charles no more excuses. 
Thank you, Madame President. 
And allow me to say that... 
No, I understand completely. 
And I appreciate your confidence in Jason. 
How soon can you leave for CTU? 
Immediately. 
Good. I'll handle the 
arrangements on this end. 
Congratulations, Charles. 
You have recast yourself as the great peacemaker. 
I appreciate your help in getting me this far, Mikhail. 
So tell me what I'm doing here? 
I had hoped to have this conversation in private. 
This is my attaché Pavel Tokarev. 
You can speak freely. 
He is more than well acquainted with the situation. 
Well... 
There's been an unforeseen problem. 
Apparently I'm not the only one who can prove that elements in your government conspired to undermine the peace process. 
Meaning? 
Dana Walsh, the mole you installed inside CTU, claims to have evidence to that effect. 
Not possible. 
She was handled with complete deniability. 
So you say. 
But, no one in this room can take the chance that she's bluffing. 
Now... I tried 
to contain this. 
I had Ms. Walsh detained 
and interrogated. 
The problem is, Jack Bauer just broke her out. 
Apparently, he has a personal interest in exposing this evidence. 
Then you need to stop him. 
Surely President Taylor is motivated to do the same. 
She is, to a point. 
But I know Bauer. 
And I can promise you he will never let this go. 
And I don't think the president is willing to do what is ultimately required. 
So you expect me to kill Bauer for you? 
We both know you have the covert assets here to do the job. 
Maybe I do but I don't have the resources to find him, track him. 
CTU does. 
And the man in charge of the search now reports to me. 
How would this work? 
This is a closed-channel phone. 
It's impossible to intercept. 
My man at CTU will use it to feed your people real-time information as to Bauer's whereabouts. 
And they can put an end to this problem, once and for all. 
We have to assume that CTU's been getting my face out there. 
You're going to have to take her into the bank on your own. 
I'll stand sentry in the lobby. 
How well do you know the layout inside? 
Vault's in the back. 
Tellers are on one side of the room, loan officers are on the other. 
One of them's an old buddy of mine from high school. 
He was helping us line up a mortgage. 
Okay, you keep her inside your strike zone. 
If she sees an opportunity, she's going to take it. 
You trust her for nothing, you understand? 
I'll be fine, Jack. 
Okay, let's go. 
I know you hate me right now, but I don't really believe you want to see me executed. 
Save it. 
We both saw how close he came to pulling the trigger back there. 
That's just what he wanted you to think. 
If that's what he told you, he's lying. 
Just like he's lying about what he's going to do with that file. 
Jack wants to bring the people responsible for this to justice. 
Just like me. Who do you think 
these people are, Cole? 
They're Russian diplomats with full diplomatic immunity. 
They'll be indicted by the World Court and hauled up in front of the Hague. 
You really believe Jack Bauer wants to trust some toothless international tribunal to mete out justice to the people who killed Renee? 
Keep going. 
You're hurting me. 
You'll live. 
Confirm all traffic camera feeds are being ported through us. 
Up-res and route everything through facial recognition. 
Parameter-matching on Jack, Cole, or Dana. 
We don't have anywhere near the bandwidth to do that citywide. 
Then job the overflow to NSA. 
Where are we on setting up the search grid with NYPD? 
In process. 
They're giving us all the personnel they can spare, But they're going on record that, unless we narrow down the search area, it's "needle in a haystack" time. 
O'Brian. 
There's a Jason Pillar on his way to see you. 
Pillar? 
Yeah. 
Tim Wood's office pre-cleared him. 
Send him up. 
He's already on his way. 
He wouldn't wait. 
Never heard of this guy. 
Who is he? 
He was second in command at DIA under the Daniel's administration. 
He's been working the private sector for years. 
Ms. O'Brian, Jason Pillar. 
This is my associate Eden Linley. 
Okay. 
So why are you here? 
Frankly, the White House is unhappy with the way the manhunt for Jack Bauer's been handled. 
President Taylor's issued an executive order placing me in charge of the search from here on. 
What?! You'll retain your 
position as acting director for the time being with authority over all over CTU operations. 
Arlo, give us a minute? 
You got it. 
This doesn't make any sense. 
Excuse me? 
Why are you here? 
You have nothing to do with Homeland Security anymore. 
Ms. O'Brian, 
all you need to know is that I'm here under the president's orders. 
Well, you're wasting your time. 
We've done everything possible to find Jack. 
If that were true, then the trap you set for Bauer would have worked. 
It's not that simple. 
Instead, you were more concerned with making sure he didn't get hurt. 
It's all in the hourlies. 
In fact, the last operational command you sent to Agent Ortiz was, "Remember, non-lethal force." 
Not exactly the appropriate sentiment when the president told you how important it was that Bauer be stopped. 
The president doesn't want Jack to be hurt. 
She knows what he'd done for this country-- and so do you. 
What Bauer's doing will destroy the peace agreement. 
And the president cannot let that happen. 
It's time to take off the kid gloves. 
We need all protocols and encryption keys transferred to us immediately. 
As well as system overrides and administrative privileges. 
Understood? 
Ms. O'Brian? 
Yeah, understood. 
Re-code the all-agency bulletin on Bauer to "armed and dangerous" level eight. 
And change the use of force guidelines to "unrestricted." 
Here we go. 
Just make yourselves comfortable. 
I'll be right back with your safety deposit box. 
Thanks. 
Thank you. 
Let's go. 
Something funny? 
This. You and me 
it's not the way that it was supposed to turn out. 
I'm serious, Cole. 
Now that this is all over, you deserve to hear the truth. 
It's a little late for the truth. 
If you're even capable of it. 
You don't have to believe me. 
I was a kid. 
A kid with five years of prison behind me and no future to speak of. 
A guy came to see me a Russian. 
Said that he could give me a fresh start. 
I had absolutely no idea what I was getting myself into. 
You could have come clean anytime you wanted. 
And go back to jail. 
Not a chance. 
Look, I know that it's not an excuse, but ever since I met you I have been trying to dig myself out of this mess that I'm in. 
You're right I don't believe you. 
It's why I made that video file, Cole. 
I was going to use it as leverage to get the Russians to leave us alone. 
Us? 
Yes. 
There is no "us," Dana. 
There never was. 
It was a lie from the beginning. 
That is not true. 
Just stop playing me. 
It's not going to work. 
I am not playing you. 
I loved you. 
Here we go-- 14-05. 
I'll be outside. 
Thank you, Brian. 
No. 
You never give up, do you? 
You guys all right? 
Hey, Cole... 
911. What is your emergency? 
Hi. I'm at First Unity 
Savings Bank on Lexington. 
There's a guy by the front door. 
I-I think I saw him on the news. 
I think he has a gun. 
Oh, my God. 
He's looking in my direction. 
Oh, God! 
Great. As quickly 
as you can. 
The 911 comm center just confirmed the call. 
Bauer was supposedly I.D.'d by someone 
at the First Unity Savings branch on Lexington. 
Supposedly? 
What do you mean supposedly? 
It means all we have is the caller's word that she recognized Jack from the news coverage. 
We don't have secondary confirmation. 
Then get it for me. 
Request access to the bank's video surveillance system. 
I've already contacted them. 
I'm just trying to connect. 
Having trouble getting the CTU comm protocols to work. 
You, what's your name? 
Devon Rosenthal. 
Help her. 
Don't look at O'Brian. 
I'm giving you the order. 
Just follow it. 
All right, let's see what's going on. 
All right, this is the... 
Oh, good. 
Got it? 
Here we go. 
Full access to the bank's video surveillance system. 
We got him. 
Call NYPD and make sure they realize the priority here. 
And tell them I want to be looped in their operation in real time. 
Got it. 
Be right back. 
Yes? 
We found Bauer. 
He's at a bank. 
First Unity Savings on Lexington. 
How do you know? 
A 911 call confirmed by video surveillance. 
Then the police are already on their way. 
Can't help that. 
But once they have Bauer, I'll find out where they're holding him. 
You'll have to take him out while he's in custody. 
I'll wait for your call. 
Brown jacket, freeze! 
Police! 
Get your hands up! 
Get your hands up now! 
Hands up! 
On your knees. 
Get down on your knees. 
Put your hands behind your head. 
Interlock your fingers, thumbs out. 
Do not move. 
We got him. 
Take it easy. 
You got no chance. 
We got units coming in. 
Shut up! 
You know who I am? 
Do you know who I am?! 
Yes. 
I don't want to kill your partner, but I will if I have to. 
So here's what we're gonna do: Slowly, you're gonna put your gun down. 
Drop your weapon now! 
Kick it over to me. 
I'm sorry. 
Call an ambulance. 
Call an ambulance now. 
Tell them two police officers are down. 
Don't you move! 
Slowly... turn around 
and head back to me. 
Now! 
What happened to Cole? 
Did you kill him? 
I could never do that. 
Where's the evidence? 
It's in my pocket. 
Show me. 
Jack, we can make a deal. 
Show me! 
I want you to slowly put it down on the floor. 
Jack... 
Tell me what I can do. 
Nothing. 
Nothing. 
Transcript by Addic7ed.com 
Our security police have completed their initial sweep of the capital city. 
65 known members of the opposition have been arrested and are being questioned. 
Have you learned anything? 
Were any of them working with my brother? 
It's too early to tell. 
Kayla, your father is a great man, but Farhad's betrayal has changed him. 
What can we do? 
The president says you may be involved with his brother. 
He's ordered me to detain you. 
I'll talk to him. 
President Hassan's crackdown isn't just a response to the attempt on his life. 
There are unsecured nuclear materials in play. 
CTU is running an undercover operation to retrieve them as we speak. 
I've got something. 
It's an NYPD evidence lockup. 
A local vice group just impounded $120,000. 
I help you do this and you never call me again. 
That's beautiful, man. Absolutely beautiful. 
It's a cop. 
You're going to have to slip past him. 
 I'm at the warehouse... 
 Nick! 
Kevin, stop him! 
I hear there are materials for sale. 
Talk straight. 
What materials? 
Nuclear rods. 
Nobody deals in nuclear rods, nobody. 
We have a problem. 
Vladimir Laitanan knows about the fuel rods. 
Come on, Vladimir, push them harder. 
Somebody knows something. 
No one knows, there's no one left to call. 
Look, it's over! 
What is wrong with you?! 
Renee. 
Stop, stop. 
 They're Russian. 
 What are you doing? 
I need to let them take me. 
When CTU gets here, you tell them to start tracking me from the air. 
These people are gonna lead us to everything we're looking for. 
I'm unarmed, don't shoot. 
We can do business. 
Where's Jack? 
The Russians took him. 
He said that you'd be monitoring him from the air. 
We haven't seen anything. 
Where is he? 
Yeah? 
Where the hell are you? 
Hey, Jenny girl! 
You said you would call me as soon as the two of you got clear. 
I'm sorry, sweetheart, I forgot. 
We-we got-- hold on-- we got caught up celebrating our score. 
Celebrating? 
You put a police officer in the hospital. 
Hey, that wasn't me, that was Nick. 
A- And look, why do, why do you got to focus on the negative? 
We're flush 120 grand. 
Why don't you just come down here, have a drink, celebrate with us? 
We're at a club in Jersey City called Starlight. 
We'll work out your cut. 
What cut? 
I don't want anything from you, Kevin. 
We're done. 
I want you to put my key in my mailbox and get the hell out of my life like you promised. 
Yeah, that-that's not going to happen. 
What does that mean? 
This is a sweet operation that we got going here, you know? 
You getting the access codes and-and us pulling the jobs. 
W- W-Wait... 
We had a deal, Kevin. 
You promised me I do this one thing for you and then you leave me alone. 
I- I know and I, and I, and I meant that, all right, but things change, okay, an-an-and... 
We can get rich off of this, Jenny. 
You can't do this to me, Kevin. 
Jenny, please... 
Look, bitch, you're in this up to your neck. 
You want your boss and want your boyfriend finding out you're not who you say you are? 
You're gonna be our golden goose, okay? 
 Hello? 
 Dana. 
What are you doing? 
We got a situation; you need to be on the floor. 
Dana... 
I heard you, I will be right there. 
Who was that on the phone just now? 
That's none of your business. 
Actually, it is. 
When you start sneaking away to make phone calls or leave the office, making me cover for you, it becomes my business. 
Now, who was that? 
Kevin? 
How the hell would you...? 
Are you spying on me? 
Look, you want to step out on your fianc�, it's fine with me. 
God knows I've got no love for the guy. 
You have no idea what you are talking about. 
I am not cheating on Cole. 
Okay, whatever you want to call it, you'd better start telling your boyfriend what's going on or I will. 
Now, come on. 
Our undercover operation just went south. 
What's happened? 
Jack Bauer was grabbed by an unknown group of armed Russians. 
We think they're the ones in control of the nuclear rods. 
Are we tracking them? 
We can't. 
They took Bauer through an underground access behind the building. 
Without aerial support, the best my people could do was track them to a drainage junction near Avenue Y and Ocean. 
They must have had a vehicle standing by. 
Jack's cell phone was trashed at the scene. 
Well, there has to be something at the site to help us ID the vehicle. 
Tire treads, transmission fluid, oil residue? 
No, there's nothing, sir, the trail's gone cold. 
Well, what about Walker? 
Did she get a good look at these people? 
I don't know, sir. 
Frankly, she's pretty messed up right now. 
Blaming herself for Jack's circumstances. 
Well, she should. 
She crippled this operation when she murdered her contact. 
Without Vladimir Laitanan, we have no lead to finding Bauer or the nuclear materials. 
You get her back to CTU for debriefing. 
I want to know what the hell happened. 
Yes, sir. 
You might want to consider running a psych eval on her when we arrive. 
Count on it. 
You were supposed to be coordinating with NSA, monitoring chatter. 
I know, something came up, I had to take care of it. 
What was so important? 
It's my fault, Mr. Hastings. 
I asked Dana to recover a datalog I accidentally deleted from archives. 
I didn't have clearance. 
I'm uplinking to NSA servers now. 
All right. 
Just get on it. 
Roll back any chatter within the last 20 minutes. 
Right now that's all we've got. 
Let me know if something turns up. 
I need to brief President Taylor. 
Thank you. 
You can thank me by putting aside whatever it is that's bothering you and helping me find Jack. 
He's my friend and he's in trouble. 
Take him down the hall. 
Where is Vladimir? 
Dead. 
So are his men. 
The German said they tried to rip him off. 
Did he also say how he knows about the fuel rods? 
Who are you? 
Ernst Meier. 
I've been looking for you to make you an offer. 
You know who I am? 
No. 
All I know is that there's a very powerful man in the Russian syndicate who's been trafficking weapons-grade uranium, specifically U-235 fuel rods. 
After the nasty business with Laitanan, these men brought me here, so I'm just assuming you're that man. 
Where did you get this information? 
I represent a consortium of private interests. 
They intercepted communiques within the Islamic republic. 
From whom? 
Farhad Hassan... 
or someone in his camp. 
In either case, you're doing business with the wrong people. 
And who are these people-- the ones you work for? 
I'm sure you can understand I'm not at liberty to say. 
Aah! 
You should be less concerned about who I work for and more concerned about the deal that they're willing to offer you. 
I'm not interested in your offer. 
$250 million, half of which is ready to be wired to you immediately. 
The other half you will receive upon final acquisition of the fuel rods. 
You pose a very difficult problem for me. 
You show up out of nowhere, knowing far too much of my business, yet I've never heard of you. 
You've never heard of me because I'm good at what I do. 
What I'm concerned about... is that you're a cop. 
I just killed three people back at that garage. 
Vladimir Laitanan-- I stabbed in the eye. 
You really think I'm a cop? 
As a child, I saw KGB throw an entire family off the roof of a building, two of them small children. 
I know what cops are capable of. 
So I ask you again: Who do you work for? 
I'm sorry, I can't tell you that. 
Dimitri, work on him until he's ready to tell us everything. 
No, we can make a deal. 
We can still make a deal! 
No! No! 
No! 
You have buried your brother's body? 
It's Oleg's necklace. 
You gave it to him at his confirmation. 
You keep it. 
To remind you of him. 
I'm glad you're back. 
We may have a problem. 
What is it? 
There is a man down the hall who claims to be an arms broker. 
He knows about the nuclear rods. 
How could he? 
He says there was a leak from Farhad's people, but I wonder. 
Until I know for certain who and what this man is, I've stopped the transport of the rods. 
They've been redirected to our weigh station off the Wantagh Parkway. 
I'm sure Farhad can't be happy about that. 
I haven't told him yet. 
Perhaps we should tell him together. 
How long do you plan to hold him off? 
That depends. 
On what? 
On how long it takes Dimitri to break this guy. 
Okay, Mr. Policeman. 
I'm not a cop. 
I swear to you. 
Please, don't do this. 
Tell me what you know. 
We are exhausting all efforts to ascertain who took Bauer and where, but until any progress is made, we just have to hope that Jack can find some way of salvaging the operation on his end. 
What even makes you think he's still alive? 
Only the fact that he wasn't killed at the point of abduction. 
Mr. Hastings, I need a realistic assessment. 
What are the odds of finding and securing these nuclear weapons within the next few hours? 
I can't answer that, ma'am, but the longer we're out of touch with Bauer, the less likely our chances. 
All right, Mr. Hastings. 
Continue to coordinate with my office. 
I want updates every 30 minutes. 
Yes, ma'am. 
I just spoke to General Wasim. 
He's very worried. 
Your brother's crackdowns back home are intensifying. 
Everyone is being arrested. 
Our window of opportunity is closing. 
And why didn't the general call me himself? 
Perhaps he's losing confidence in your ability to complete our mission. 
This is my mission. 
My plan! 
Of course. 
But we're running out of time. 
If your brother dismantles our opposition forces, we will no longer be able to reconstitute our nuclear program. 
He won't succeed. 
At this rate, he will. 
How much longer must we wait for the delivery of the uranium? 
Not long. 
The rods should be arriving to you within the hour. 
Have your men ready. 
I'll call you back. 
Yes? What is it? 
There is a man downstairs who's shown up to outbid you for the fuel rods. 
Is this some feeble attempt to renegotiate terms? 
Not at all. This man, Meier, 
claims someone in your organization tipped him off to our deal. 
That's not possible. He's lying. 
At any rate, in light of his sudden appearance, I'm halting delivery of the rods for the time being. 
What? You can't do that. 
It's already done. 
I cannot take the risk that we may be exposed. 
The longer you delay, the more time my brother has to crush his enemies. 
If he manages to purge everyone in the military who opposes him, the uranium is worthless to me. 
That's your concern. 
Mine is to make certain this Meier is not a policeman. 
One of my men is interrogating him now. 
That could take hours, even days. 
Not days. 
I can promise you that. 
You promised to assassinate my brother, too. 
Your failure to eliminate him has put me under enormous pressure, and now, because of your people's inability to maintain secrecy, you break our agreed timetable to suit your needs. 
Don't speak to my father that way. 
We've honored every agreement we made with you, and shed a lot of blood for it. 
My father's allowed you to stay here and hide from the Feds at great personal risk to our family. 
Tell him to put the gun down. 
No. 
We're not taking any more of your demands. 
Throw him out of here. 
Let his own people shelter him if he thinks we're such fools. 
I'll drive him there myself if that's what it takes. 
It would seem you have used up our hospitality here. 
Perhaps it's best you join your men at the rendezvous point to wait for delivery. 
And when will that be? 
When I think it's safe. 
Not a moment before. 
Make sure he gets where he's going. 
Still got men back at the scene in case we missed something. 
In the meantime, I'll work out the aerial sweep protocols with Arlo. 
What are you doing to find Jack? 
Everything we can, Ms. Walker. Come with me. 
Have you checked all the... the traffic cams, subway routes? 
You have all this technology working for you comm surveillance, satellite tracking. 
We're using everything at our disposal. 
Then how come you haven't found him yet? 
Why don't you have any leads? 
The best lead we had is dead. 
I know about your suicide attempt. 
You should have been honest with me. 
O'Brian will take your statement. 
I want to know every detail about every event leading up to the death of Vladimir Laitanan. 
When she's done, take her to medical. 
I've ordered a full psych evaluation. 
Yes, sir. 
Uh, you can write your statement here. 
Hastings blames me for what happened to Jack. 
And he's right. 
No, he's not. 
He shouldn't have said that. 
The only reason that Jack was even part of this operation was because of me. 
So whatever they're doing to him right now, it's because of me. 
I have to find him, Chloe. 
Renee, I know how you must feel. 
Just... just take one thing at a time. 
We have to deal with what you did. 
So write your statement. 
I'll check back with you. 
Cole. 
Hey. 
Do you have some time? I need to talk to you. 
Can it wait? I need to review these protocols 
before Arlo distributes them. 
I've got it covered. 
Go talk to your girlfriend. 
What's up? 
You all right? 
No, I'm not. 
I have a big problem. 
And it's the reason why I've been acting kind of weird the past few days. 
Okay. 
Listen, if you're calling off the engagement, you couldn't have picked a worse day. 
No. 
No, I would never do that. 
Good. 
So what's bothering you? 
There are things about my past that I haven't told you. 
I'm listening. 
Hey. 
I'm sure I haven't told you everything about my past either. 
I don't care what happened before I met you. 
All that matters is now and what we have to look forward to. 
I think that's all that matters, too. 
So what are you so worried about? 
I don't want to lose you. 
I'm not going anywhere. 
Excuse me. 
Agent Ortiz, Mr. Hastings needs to see you in his office. 
Uh, tell him I'll be there as soon as I can. 
 No. Go. 
 Hastings can wait. 
So can this. 
Talking to you has helped. 
I think I know what I need to do now. 
You sure? 
Mm-hmm. 
Okay. 
Maybe later you tell me what this is all about. 
Who do you work for? 
Who else knows about the fuel rods? 
Everybody has a limit. 
Don't worry, I'll find yours. 
You're working with the police. 
Admit it! 
Tell me and the pain will stop. 
Who else knows? 
I told you... I'm not a cop. 
Please. 
I'm just a businessman. 
Please. 
Who do you work for? 
I'm an independent contractor. 
I couldn't even tell you if I wanted. 
Please. 
We'll see. 
Wake up. 
I said, wake up. 
I told you I didn't want to be disturbed. 
Your daughter is still demanding to see you, Mr. President. 
She refuses to leave. 
Very well. Send her in. 
Kayla, my love, I'm in the middle of a crisis, so unless it's an emergency... 
It is an emergency. 
We need to talk about you having Tarin arrested. 
Tarin has been taken to the embassy to help clarify a few questions, strictly routine. 
I know you believe he's been working against you. 
What I don't understand is why. 
He refused to follow my orders. 
You asked him to arrest the family of one of your delegates. 
A man you considered a friend. 
Kayla, this is a matter of state; it doesn't concern you. 
It doesn't make sense. 
Tarin was in the car with you if the assassination attempt was successful, he would've been killed, too. 
The world is full of men willing to die for their cause. 
I know you consider Tarin a friend. 
And your loyalty is commendable. 
But trust me, I have my reasons. 
We are more than friends. 
We're in love, and have been for almost a year. 
You've been carrying on with this man behind my back? 
You say that to me, after driving mother away with your infidelity. 
Please, Father. 
Don't let Uncle Farhad's betrayal turn you against everyone who cares about you. 
I can't think of a better way to completely infiltrate my life and influence my judgment than getting close to my daughter. 
It's not like that. 
You're not to see that man again, ever. 
Father... 
I'm done with this conversation. 
I need to get back to my work. 
What's happening to you? 
Come on. 
Damn it! 
I am holding the rods until Meier comes clean about how he knew of the transfer. 
If what Meier said is true about the leak in Farhad's team, it will be dangerous for us. 
So we must unload the rods, finish this. 
Let them be someone else's problem... 
And we erase any evidence. 
Once Dimitri is finished, and I'm satisfied the German is telling the truth, I'm going to want to hand off the rods to Farhad tonight. 
Keep your men out of sight along the perimeter. 
Mikhail and his men will stay with the cargo. 
Check to see if the rest of the street lost power. 
Just us. 
It's Meier. 
Cover the exits. 
Check the fuse box. 
Come on. 
CTU. O'Brian. 
Chloe. It's Jack. 
Jack, everyone's been looking for you. 
Where are you? 
I need you to trace this call and send a Tac team immediately. 
 Jack? 
 Chloe, just trace the call. 
Jack! 
We're sure NYPD's got the perimeter locked down? 
The restaurant and everything in a block radius is secure. 
Our response team will be there soon. 
Where's Dana? 
She logged out of the building about 15 minutes ago. 
Something about fixing a faulty relay at our 17th Street station. 
Why didn't she just have IP maintenance take care of it? 
Good question. 
She had to manually reboot the firmware herself. 
That's what she said anyway. 
Where are we with this man Bazhaev? 
It's coming through right now. 
I've cross-accessed interagency servers, also Interpol and FSB. 
I'm relaying intel as it comes in to our response team and to Jack. 
Good. Put it up on screen. 
Okay, people. 
We've ID'd the suspect we have in custody. 
His name is Sergei Petrovich Bazhaev, Ukrainian national, 61 years of age. 
Now, we believe he knows the location of the unsecured nuclear rods. 
Now, tactical is on its way to transport him back here for interrogation. 
Agent Ortiz will coordinate operations from here. 
Is it true? You found Jack? 
Yeah. He's okay. 
If you're finished with your statement, I need to take you to medical. 
No. No. I want to be here when Jack gets back. 
I'll let him know where to find you. 
Come on. 
Mr. Bauer, this should hold you for now. 
But you're going to have to go to the hospital. 
 Okay. 
 Excuse me, sir. 
They uploaded the suspect's file right now. 
How far out is CTU? 
They're about five minutes out. 
It's all right. I got it. Thanks. 
Sergeant? 
I need to speak with this man alone. 
I knew you were a cop. 
I should have trusted my instincts and killed you on the spot. 
Well, you can add it to your list of regrets. 
CTU's already acquired a great deal of intel on you, Mr. Bazhaev. 
It's over. You know that, right? 
You're finished. 
I mean, at the very least, we've got you on kidnapping and murder, and that's before CTU rips this place apart and uncovers the rest of your criminal activity. 
Lucky for you, though, I'm only interested in one thing, and that's the acquisition of those fuel rods. 
So, if you were to cooperate, that would go a long way to reducing what is clearly going to be a very long prison sentence. 
That offer extends to both of your sons, too Josef and Oleg. 
Oleg is dead. 
He was exposed to the rods. 
Became ill with radiation poisoning. 
He was suffering, and I shot him, as if he was just a sick dog. 
I murdered my own son. 
For nothing. 
You want to know where the rods are? 
I will tell you. 
But I want full immunity. 
Not just for me, but for my other son, Josef. 
I don't think I can make that happen. 
Then we have nothing to talk about. 
I'll see what I can do. 
CTU. O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. 
I need to speak with Hastings. 
I think he's in the middle of a briefing with President Taylor. 
Even better. See if you can patch me in, okay? 
Okay. 
Mr. Hastings, it's Farhad Hassan I'm worried about. 
How do we know he hasn't acquired the rods already? 
Based on the intel we have, the transfer hasn't taken place yet. 
Madam President, excuse the interruption. 
Jack Bauer is on the line. 
He wishes to be conferenced in. 
Put him through. 
Jack, it's President Taylor. 
You're on with Mr. Hastings 
and my chief of staff. 
CTU's been keeping me apprised of your involvement in this. 
I'm sorry that it's taken this long for us to speak. 
I understand, and please forgive me for getting straight to the point, but the man that we have in custody, Sergei Bazhaev, is willing to cooperate. 
He said he would hand over the fuel rods in exchange for full immunity for him and his son. 
Is that all? 
Why don't me give him a parade down Broadway, too? 
Jack, you've been dealing with this man. 
Is there no other way to get the location of the nuclear materials out of him? 
It says in his files that he did 12 years in a Russian labor camp. 
In the time frame that we have, we're not gonna break him, Madam President. 
I can see it in his eyes. 
Mr. Hastings, what is your assessment? 
Well, at first blush, I'd say an immunity deal is premature, but under the circumstances, I'll defer to Jack's judgment on this. 
Gentlemen, I have a peace deal that's going to fall apart at any moment unless I can show President Hassan that we have stopped his brother from smuggling those fuel rods out of the country. 
Make the deal, Jack. 
Madam President, he's going to want this in writing. 
He'll get it. 
But in the interests of expediency, put him on the phone with me. 
Yes, ma'am. 
The President of the United States wants to talk to you. 
You want to tell me what's going on? 
What are you talking about? 
You were implying something about Dana, and I want to know what it is. 
When she came over before and said she had to talk to you, what did she tell you? 
Nothing. She said she had a problem, and she'd handle it. 
That's it? 
Arlo, if you know something... 
Okay, look, it's none of my business, and I didn't want to be the one to tell you this, but I think she went to meet some guy. 
You're out of your mind. 
Take a look at this. 
Who is he? 
I checked with the gate. 
They said his name is Kevin Wade. 
Identified himself as a friend. 
Okay, so he's a friend. 
Cole? 
Bazhaev's given up the location of the nuclear rods. 
I've already scrambled a NEST team. 
Meet your tactical unit at the helipad. 
The coordinates will be relayed to you en route. 
Yes, sir. 
You think you can find her? 
I could if all the drones weren't already committed. 
What about a cell trace? 
Just do it. 
I don't know where you are or what you're doing, Dana, but I need you to call me as soon as you get this. 
It's important. 
I love you. 
Thank you, sir. 
Sorry. 
Don't worry about it. 
Miss Kayla, no. 
Get out of my way, Nabeel. 
I want to see him. 
Your father forbids it. 
I'm sorry. I'm just doing my job. 
A job that Tarin gave you. 
He brought you into my father's security detail, and this is how you repay him? 
You're his friend, Nabeel. 
You know he's innocent. 
What would you have me do? 
Just let me speak to him. 
A few minutes is all I ask. 
I can't let you in now. 
Tarin's going to be readied for transport to our embassy in an hour. 
I will find a moment you can see him before then. 
Thank you, Nabeel. 
Now go before we're both in trouble. 
Cole, the NEST team's ETA is two minutes from target site. 
Now the HAZMAT crew will wait for your signal to move in. 
Be advised the truck with the fuel rods is being guarded by two armed hostiles. 
Command, we have an immunity deal with their boss. 
Why haven't they been ordered to stand down? 
Well, Jack's understanding is that these men are hard cases. 
They won't roll over easily. 
We cannot take the risk that they'll flee with the rods. 
Understood. 
Now, when you secure the nuclear materials, you'll transport them to Fort Hamilton. 
We're clearing that air corridor as we speak. 
Command, we see the truck, but there's no sign of hostiles. 
Approaching the weigh station now. Stand by. 
Set us down there. 
Picking up trace radiation. 
30 millirads. It's safe. 
Go, go. Move in. 
We're clear. 
Command, are you seeing this? 
I am. 
Where the hell are the rods? 
We picked up trace radiation signatures. 
The rods were here. 
Right now all we have are two bodies, both shot. 
Hey, Agent Ortiz. 
Come on, man, you can have a good time. 
It's okay. It's okay to laugh once in a while. 
You can be a happy person. 
This is Bauer. 
It's Hastings. 
Our team's at the truck stop. 
The nuclear rods are not there. 
What? H-Hold on. Say that again. 
I said the rods are not there. 
That's not possible. 
Did your men go to the right place? 
They went exactly where you sent them. 
Now stop playing games and tell us where the rods are. 
I told you, they were there. 
I had two of my men guarding them. 
We found their bodies, both shot. 
And there was something else. 
Some kind of necklace hanging on the inside of the truck's door. 
Like someone wanted to send a message. 
What kind of a necklace? 
A gold cross. 
What does that mean? 
Josef. 
I have the fuel rods. 
Really? 
I wasn't sure I believed, Josef, that you would betray your father. 
You were upset that he was holding up delivery of the rods; now I've gotten them for you. 
It won't take him long to realize what's happened, so let's get this done fast. 
You're worried he'll discover you've replaced him as our partner. 
No, I want my father to know. 
In fact, I made sure he will. 
When will you get here? 
Less than five minutes. 
Transcript by Addic7ed.com 
Hassan's security forces in the Islamic Republic are sweeping through the capital, arreing opposition leaders. 
And if he continues, it may delegitimize the peace accord. 
I can't vouch for you as a reformer, Mr. President, 
if you renege on your human rights obligations. 
My brother tried to kill me, helped by elements within my own government. 
Apparently, killing President Hassan was only part of his brother's plan. 
CTU now believes he's also trying to acquire weapons-grade uranium. 
When can I take possession of the rods? 
As soon as we have the money. 
JOSEF: I found a doctor who can treat him. 
BAZHAEV: No doctors. 
The authorities know about the nuclear material. 
Putting Oleg in a clinic would lead them right to us. 
Dr. Levine. 
How did you get in here? 
My brother is sick. 
I'm gonna call you an ambulance. 
No. 
No one can know about this. 
(gasping): No, no. 
What do you want from me? 
You're a data analyst for CTU. 
You got access to all sorts of good stuff. 
Yeah, but not unrestricted access. 
Payout's got to be at least six figures. 
You were undercover for nearly two years with the Russian Mob. 
You're asking me to go back in? 
Vladimir Laitanan was completely obsessed with her. 
It turned violent. 
Did he rape her? 
It looks like he tried a couple of times. 
Can we talk about this deal now? 
I wish it were that simple. 
Tie her up. 
What? 
Look, you're making a mistake. 
This is the chance of a lifetimK] JACK: This operation's over. 
Vladimir didn't take the bait. 
Renee, it's Jack. 
I know you can hear me. 
I'm on my way now. 
You don't want to do this deal, then you might as well just kill me, because this deal is the only thing that I have. 
Do it! 
Pull the trigger! 
I had to be sure. 
CHLOE: Jack, are you there? 
What's going on? 
She's in. 
They bought her cover. 
JACK (over comm): Renee, I've got a visual on you. 
I'm going off comm for a minute. 
You all right? 
(phone rings) CHLOE: CTU, O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. I want you 
to monitor Renee's comm. 
I need to speak to Hastings. 
Okay, I'll put you through. 
I'm here, Jack. Go ahead. 
We need to pull Renee Walker out now. 
Based on what? 
Because she's a danger to herself and this mission. 
Ten minutes ago, Laitanan threatened to execute her, and she said she was sick of living and wanted to die and she meant it. 
She must've been playing him. 
No. She doesn't care 
what happens to her, that's what makes her dangerous. 
She's like a bomb ready to go off. 
We need to get her out of there before that happens. Look, I understand 
your concern, but we can't just roll up this operation before we find those nuclear rods. 
We can arrest Laitanan. 
If he knows how to find the rods, I will make him talk. 
If you're saying what I think you are, we don't do that anymore. 
Then you people do what you do well offer him immunity or something. 
This is the Russian Syndicate. 
They're very secretive, they protect their own. 
It is highly unlikely that Laitanan would cooperate. 
Then you better find another way, because I am not gonna let Renee die because CTU did their job badly. 
I will not let that happen. 
Do you understand me? 
Jack, if you can think of something, I will listen. 
But right now, Renee's the only hope we have of neutralizing this threat. 
And on my order, she stays in play. 
Jack? 
I'll find a way to get her out when I go in as the buyer. 
I'll sy under in her place. 
Do we have a deal? 
As long as you can do it without risking the mission. 
I give you my word. 
Agent Ortiz will meet you at the staging area with a TAC team. 
He'll have everything you need for your cover. 
Hold on. 
They're moving. 
I need to get back on comm. 
VLADIMIR: We'll go back to my shop, and we will discuss this buyer of yours. 
(engine starts) (tires squealing) HASTINGS: Dana... (gasps) 
start forwarding mission status reports to the Nuclear Emergency Team at Fort Hamilton. 
I want them ready to go in as soon as we find these nuclear rods. 
I'm on it, sir. 
(phone rings) Ye. 
It's me. 
I've got something. 
Damn, you're fast. 
Okay, hold on. 
Okay, go. 
Let's hear it. 
It's an NYPD evidence lockup. 
According to the manifest, a local vice group just impounded a stash of drug money. 
It'll be held there for the next 48 hours. 
How much? 
$120,000. 
All right, what's the plan? 
You go in and take it. 
(chuckles) What do you mean, break into a police station? 
What, are you out of your mind? 
It's not a police station. 
It's a warehouse. 
Most of the security is automated. 
I can manipulate it from here. 
You walk in, you walk out with the cash. 
I'll talk you through it. 
I need to access their security codes, work up a keycard to get you inside the warehouse. 
How long? 
Meet me outside CTU in 30 minutes. 
ARLO: Did you take care of your situation? 
Situation? 
The big mystery you had to leave work for. 
Oh, yeah, it's fine. 
What do you need, Arlo? 
I'm getting five percent lag in my Drone's ABS controls. 
With everything going on, I think I'm just running hot. 
Okay, I'll make sure to free up some memory space on the auxiliary servers. 
Thanks. 
You know, if there's something bothering you, you've always got my shoulder to cry on. 
Or any other body part. 
I will keep that in mind. 
But, for now, why don't you focus on running aerial support for Walker and Bauer? 
Okay. 
âª âª Lugo, take a break. 
I want to talk to her alone. 
All right, you have my attention. 
Tell me about this buyer. 
His name's Ernst Meier. 
German arms dealer. 
Never heard of him. 
He does most of his business in Asia; he just started branching out into North America. 
What's he looking to buy? 
Weapons-grade uranium. 
You're serious. 
Very. 
Someone in the Russian Syndicate smuggled nuclear fuel rods out of the Ukraine. 
They're planning on selling them on the open market. 
I... I have no idea 
what you're talking about. 
I don't, Renee. 
But you can find out. 
You're very well connected. 
I have always admired your ambition, but you're chasing the devil. 
Dealing AK47s no one really cares. 
But nuclear material? 
But the profit is worth it. 
You need money, huh? 
You can always come work for me. 
No, I'm doing this so I don't ever have to work for anyone. 
Have a seat. 
If I could find out... 
...what would it be worth? 
30% of the deal. 
I don't have to tell you, that is more money than you could possibly know what to do with. 
Look, Meier says these rods are going to be sold soon, so if we want to make a counter bid, it has to happen fast. 
If you don't know anything, tell me, so I can go somewhere else. 
How well do you know this man? 
You trust him? 
There's no one I trust more. 
I've been with him for two years. 
What do you mean "with"? 
It's professional. 
Can you help us or not? 
I'll make a few calls, see what I can find out. 
But, uh, I'm going to have to meet this Meier. 
And I need a good faith payment up front. 
How much? 
Five million. 
That's a lot of money, Vlad. 
Look, I'm taking big risk just making these calls. 
Besides, 5 million is nothing compared to what your buyer will have to pay for nuclear fuel rods. 
Fine. 
I'll ask him, but I can't make any promises. 
If he wants my help, that's the price of admission. 
Okay. 
There's a parking garage on the corner of 12th and Market Street. 
Someone will meet him there, on the roof. 
Once the money is in our account, they'll bring him back here, we will talk. 
I'll give him a call. 
It's good to see you. 
You're going to make me start losing sleep again. 
I'll let you know what Meier says. 
I'll tell my men. 
I'll give you privacy for your call. 
Jack, were you listening? 
Yeah, we're ready to wire the money to his account. 
When can you be there? 
As soon as I finish prepping my cover. 
I'm almost at the staging area. 
30 minutes tops. 
How you holding up? 
It's hard to be in the same room with this son of a bitch. 
I can handle it. 
I'll be there as soon as I can. 
Okay. 
Don't worry, Oleg. 
You're going to be fine. 
It, uh... it might 
help me if I knew exactly what happened to your brother. 
How did he get exposed to weapons-grade uranium? 
Don't worry about that. 
Just make sure he lives. 
(phone ringing) It's him again, isn't it? 
The second time he's called. 
You should answer it. 
Hello? 
Why aren't you picking up your phone? 
I called you twice. 
Must have been in the tunnel. 
Ulana says you're not at the house yet. 
Where are you? 
Stuck in traffic. 
Tell her it's going to be a while. 
How's Oleg? 
He's okay. 
Sleeping. 
Let me know when you get to the house. 
I will. 
It was him, wasn't it? 
Hey. 
Don't worry, okay? 
By the time he finds out, you'll already have been treated. 
Then it won't matter. 
(knock on door) Hey, it's just your brother's test results. 
Okay. 
You say or do anything that I don't like, and my men will kill your wife and daughter. 
Open the door. 
The blood work you ordered, Doctor. 
Thank you. 
Uh, I noticed there was no patient name. 
Uh, yeah, you're right. 
I forgot to put that down. 
Oh, well, I can do it for you. 
No, I'll take care of it later. 
Is everything okay, Doctor? 
Fine. 
I'm just working a little later than I expected. 
Okay. 
You did good. 
What does it say? 
Your brother has been exposed to at least 400 rems, and the chemical toxicity of the radiation is causing renal failure. 
I know it's serious. 
Can you help him or not? 
He needs a bone marrow transplant. 
That requires a six-man surgical team in a fully equipped facility. 
There has to be something you can do right here, right now. 
There are some drugs I could give him that will help flush out the radiation and stimulate white blood cell repair, but that's a half measure. 
I can't guarantee he'll recover. 
My brother is not going to die. 
It's up to you, Doctor. 
Now get to work. 
Okay, got it. 
That was CTU. 
Your offshore account's in place. 
They're forwarding instructions to your PDA on how to wire the money. 
Excuse me. 
I spoke with Hastings. 
He said, as soon as you're under and we have confirmation that Laitanan can get us to the nuclear rods, we're pulling Renee Walker out. 
That's right. 
What's going on, Jack? 
Hastings said something about her being unstable. 
I don't have time to explain it. 
Just follow my lead. 
How do you want to work this without breaking cover? 
I don't know yet. 
All right. 
Well, I got two teams running coordinated drive-bys. 
They'll be ready to extract her when she's clear. 
No. 
These guys own this neighborhood. 
They'll have eyes everywhere. 
Your men will run the risk of being spotted. 
I've done this before, Jack. 
I ran an operation just like it in Fallujah. 
And I'm in command. 
You're going to do exactly what I tell you. 
RENEE (over comm): Jack, stand by. 
I hear him coming. 
Laitanan's back. 
I need to listen to this. 
Excuse me. 
(knock on door) VLADIMIR: Renee. 
I spoke to my men. 
Did you get your buyer on the phone? 
He agreed to the money. 
He'll be at the parking garage in 20 minutes. Very good. 
We have a little time to catch up. 
Do you still like your single malts? 
Uh, not right now. 
You sure? 
It's a 30 year. 
No, thanks. 
What you said earlier down at the river you were tired of living, wanted to die. 
What happened to you? 
It's not important. 
It is to me. 
Look, you don't have to worry about it. 
Once I make this deal, none of it will matter. 
Well, you're not the only one who's been suffering these past few years. 
It's hard for me to admit, but, uh... 
I never forgave myself for what I did to you. 
It's in the past. 
Forget it. 
VLADIMIR (over comm): I don't want to forget it. 
I had too much to drink that night, I wasn't thinking clearly. 
Wow. 
Never heard you apologize for anything. 
It's definitely a first. 
Look, I'm just trying to make things right. 
You dot have to be such a bitch about it. 
Was I being a bitch? 
Maybe I should apologize. 
Oh, you're something else. 
You never back down, do you? 
I've missed our little arguments. 
You're still nervous around me. 
I shouldn't be surprised. 
It's not you. 
VLADIMIR: Someone else? 
RENEE: No. 
VLADIMIR: What is it, then? 
Look, I'm just... 
I'm just nervous about the deal. 
Could be a lot of money at stake. 
There's more for you here than just money, if you want it. 
Look... 
I didn't come here for this. 
Really. All the people 
you could've gone to, you knocked on my door. 
Because you're connected. 
That's the only reason? 
Yes. 
I don't believe you. 
That's your problem. 
You should watch your tongue. 
You might lose it one day. 
Uh... you said 
that I could get cleaned up. 
Yeah. 
Bathroom has a shower. 
Thank you. 
Yeah. 
Agent Ortiz, we need to move now. 
Now! 
(releases held breath, breathes deeply) Renee called her buyer. 
He agreed to pay the $5 million up front. 
I want you to meet with him. 
Take a couple men. 
This is a mistake, Vlad. 
Getting involved in nuclear arms it doesn't matter how much money is at stake. 
I have no intention of pursuing this deal. 
What do you mean? 
When you've picked up the buyer, when the money has been transferred into our account, you kill him, put him in the river, keep the money for ourselves. 
What about Renee? 
She'll be working with us from now on. 
We are going to kill her buyer. 
She's not going to be happy about that. 
You heard what she said. 
She's got nothing left. 
Nowhere to go. 
Desperate woman. 
I give her reason to live. 
Okay? 
I'll take care of it. 
President Hassan's security forces they're still cracking down on the opposition, and they're not showing any signs of letting up. 
ETHAN: I'm afraid your warning to President Hassan has fallen on deaf ears, Madam President. 
Who filmed this? 
Stringer for the BBC bought it from an eyewitness. 
And they've already seen it on Downing Street. 
That's why Ethan wanted you to see this now. 
The rumors have already started that the British are pulling out as signatories to the accord. 
Then I need to talk to the prime minister. 
It's not just the British, Madam President. 
The Germans and Egyptians are also positioning themselves to pull out, and if we lose their support... 
The peace deal is dead. 
Maybe if they understood the circumstances that Hassan is trying to prevent his brother from acquiring a nuclear weapon. 
With respect, Madam President, sharing that intelligence with the delegates might spread a panic. 
You're right, but I still need to buy some time. 
Assemble the representatives from every signatory country attending the conference. 
I want to appeal to them myself to stay the course. 
What about President Hassan? 
Shouldn't we include him? 
Not until I've taken the temperature of the other delegates. 
I don't want to push him too hard. 
What is it? 
As you requested, these are backgrounds on all the detainees. 
Our security police have completed their initial sweep of the capital city. 
65 known members of the opposition have been arrested and are being questioned. 
Have you learned anything? 
Were any of them working with my brother? 
It's too early to tell. 
What's wrong, sir? 
One of the suspects... 
has family connections to a member of my delegation here at the UN. 
Who? 
Jamot. 
They are cousins. 
That doesn't mean that Jamot is involved in any of this. 
We need to make sure. 
We'll check his phone records and other recent activities for any suspicious behavior. 
Good. 
But I also want him taken into custody. 
Sir? 
Arrest him. 
Take him to our embassy for interrogation. 
Mr. President, with respect, 
Jamot is a trusted member of your inner circle. 
The evidence against him is purely circumstantial. 
I trusted my brother as well. 
Are you sure this is what you want? 
He is a public official. 
It will not go unnoticed. 
I don't care! 
I don't care what anyone thinks. 
I was almost killed today. 
Or have you forgotten? 
I was in the car with you, sir. 
Then you should know what needs to be done. 
Yes, sir. 
(clears throat) ARLO: Forget about me? 
What? 
My name's Arlo Glass. 
I'm one of your coworkers at CTU. 
You said you'd free up some memory space on the auxiliary servers. 
I'm getting to it. 
In which century? We're in 
the middle of an operation and my aerial feed is running in slow-motion. 
It's next on my list, Arlo. 
Where are you going now? 
To the bathroom. 
Is that okay with you? 
Hey, O'Brian, you notice anything weird about Dana? 
Miss Perfect? 
She seems distracted, always making excuses to leave. 
Maybe she's avoiding you. 
What? 
Well, that's what I would do if someone were drooling over me all day. 
You're lucky she hasn't reported you to Human Resources. 
If you weren't so jealous, you'd see I was asking you a serious question. 
Oh, yeah, I'm jealous. 
Please, won't you stare at my ass as I walk away? 
Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
Stay here. 
This has the address and schematic of the evidence lockup. 
You'll go through the southeast entrance. 
This keycard will get you access. 
How do we find the money? 
The evidence bins are numbered. 
You're looking for 4301. 
This is a dedicated comm unit. 
It's an earpiece; you'll be able to hear me. 
Do exactly what I tell you to do and you'll be in and out. 
No one will know you were there. 
Listen... 
I help you do this and you never call me again. 
That's the deal, right? 
Sure, Jen, that's the deal. 
I'll call you when we get to the lockup. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
(water running, turns off) You look thin. 
Be out in a minute. 
I don't want to wait that long. 
Vladimir, please, just let me get dressed. 
Why waste the energy? 
I'll just have to get you undressed all over again. 
Look, I already told you I didn't come here for this. 
That's what you say, but part of you came here to see me. 
Admit it. 
RENEE: There's nothing to admit. 
VLADIMIR: Why is it so hard for you to admit the truth? 
You want this just as much as I do. 
I'm not going to tell you again. 
Leave me alone and let me get dressed. 
Come here. 
I said come here. 
(glass shatters) Come here or get out. 
I call my men and the deal's off. 
I'll, um... I'll take 
that drink now. 
Dry yourself off. 
Come out when you're ready. 
JACK: Renee, do you copy? 
Yeah, Jack. 
You don't have to do this. 
I've got a team standing by. 
We can get you out of there now. 
Where would that leave us? 
I've got to stay under. 
We'll find another way. 
There is no other way. 
Renee, don't do this. 
Renee... 
Go meet Vlad's men. 
I'll see you when you get here. 
Why won't you listen to me? 
I'm going dark. 
Renee, wai... 
These arrests are making it very difficult for my government to continue to support the peace agreement. 
President Hassan can't ignore the repercussions of what he's doing. 
I know President Hassan. 
He is a rational man, a good man. 
There must be a reason for these actions, and I'm not just speaking as his delegate but as his friend. 
Well, as his friend, you need to let him know that my government is not the only one with grave concerns. 
This conference is at risk of falling apart... 
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt. 
Mr. Jamot, may I speak 
with you privately? 
Yes, of course. 
Excuse me. 
Of course. 
What is it? 
I've been ordered to escort you to the embassy to answer some questions. 
Regarding? 
An internal security matter. 
Please come with us. 
Well, I-I would like to know what this is about. 
We'll explain everything to you at the embassy, sir. 
Well, it will have to wait. 
I am about to go into a meeting. 
It cannot wait, sir. 
We need to go right now. 
Are you arresting me? 
It would be best if we kept this discreet. 
This is outrageous. 
I demand to speak with President Hassan. 
President Hassan is the one who gave this order. 
I will not ask you again. 
Come with us. 
Very well. 
Take him to the car. 
I'll be right there. 
Is everything all right? 
Everything is fine, sir. 
Please excuse me. 
(phone rings) Hello. 
It's me. Are you alone? Yes. 
What's wrong? 
You sound upset. 
I didn't want to burden you with this, but I need to speak with you about your father. 
What is it? 
I have to go to the embassy right now. 
I'll meet you in private when I get back. 
You're going to give him vindesine twice daily, morning and night. 
Inject it right into the I.V. bag, 
just like I'm doing. 
You're going to want to be careful. 
Radiation poisoning is transferable through bodily fluids. 
Are you paying attention? 
Yes, I see. 
He's also going to get cisplatin every other day, but he can take that in pill form. 
I'm going to give you three weeks' worth. 
How will I know if he's getting better? 
If the treatment's working, his symptoms will begin to subside in seven to ten days. 
We're going to be leaving soon. 
Where? To the country house. 
The doctor's giving me everything I need to treat y. 
You're going to get better, Oleg. 
(knocking on door) That's the nurse with the rest of the medicine. 
(gunshot) Throw down your weapon, Josef. 
Do what I said. 
Don't make this worse than it is. 
Drop it! 
You son of a bitch. 
Who else knows about Oleg's sickness? 
Who else knows? 
Just the doctor. 
Are you sure? 
I'm sure. 
Undo him. 
Hey, wait, stop. 
What are you doing? 
Your father sent us to bring you home. 
Now, Josef. 
OLEG: Josef... 
it's okay. 
Just do what he says. 
I have him. 
We found them. 
Where were they? 
A clinic in Mount Vernon. 
How many people found out about Oleg? 
Only one a doctor but we've taken care of him. 
Nobody will know we were here. 
Good. 
Now, bring my sons to me. 
Da. 
Let's go. 
Meier? 
That's right. 
You are from Germany. 
Bremen. 
But I grew up traveling with my father. 
(speaking German) Are we going to do business or not? 
Where is the $5 million? 
You don't see any money until I talk to Laitanan. 
If you have questions, ask me. 
I don't want to talk to you. 
Get him on the phone or I drive away. 
Now. 
(phone rings) Yes? 
LUGO: Meier is here. 
He won't transfer the money until he speaks with you first. 
Put him on. 
This is Meier. 
Yes, Mr. Meier. 
What's the problem? 
After you get your money, how long till I get my information? 
Not very long; I just have to make a few calls. 
No more than an hour. 
Where is Renee? 
She's busy. 
I would like to talk to her. 
VLADIMIR: You can see her when you get here. 
We have nothing more to discuss until the money's in place. 
Now, get Lugo on the phone. 
Fine. 
Go ahead. 
Once the money is confirmed into our account, you know what to do. 
Yes. 
I need your account number. 
JACK: I'm transferring the money through multiple accounts so it can't be traced. 
This will take a moment. 
We'll wait. 
Is it done? 
Not yet. 
My partner's good for the money, Vladimir. 
You should be making calls, tracking down the rods. 
I'm not going to make any calls, 'cause there isn't going to be any deal with your partner. 
What are you talking about? 
Once we have the money... 
it's over. 
We don't need him anymore. 
And we'll be $5 million richer. 
You son of a bitch. 
Hey, I'm not a fool, Renee. 
I'm not about to get involved with the kind of people who traffic in nuclear arms. Okay, Vladimir, 
listen, you can't do this. 
Why? This man 
mean something to you? 
No, but I worked for more than a year to make this deal. 
I'm not just going to let it go because you don't have the guts to see it through. 
Hey, this isn't about guts. 
This is about being smart. 
Really? 
Is it smart to keep selling small arms for the rest of your life? 
I bring you the score of a lifetime, and you just piss it away? 
For what- for $5 million? 
How long is that going to last you? 
Long enough. 
You're more than all this. 
I know it. 
It's why I brought this deal to you. 
We can do this. 
Together. 
Once we've made the deal and we have the money, we can be together. 
We could start over. 
Make our own moves. 
But I need my buyer. 
Alive. 
Sorry. 
This is the way I want it. 
You'll see. 
It's for the best. 
What are you doing? 
Making a call. 
Put down the phone. 
I said put it down! 
Don't ever go against me! 
Renee, you should know that by now. 
Okay?! 
How much longer? 
It's almost done. 
There. 
The money's in your account. 
LUGO: Thank you, Mr. Meier. 
(gunshots) Drop the weapon. 
Now! Drop it! 
You really think I'm that stupid? 
That I'd come here alone? 
Call your man. Do it! 
Give me the phone. 
(phone ringing) I see we have the money. 
Is Meier dead? 
Not exactly, but I've just taken out three of your men, and I'm ready to take out the fourth. 
Meier. 
You really think you can roll me for $5 million? 
Where's Renee? 
She's right here. She's fine. 
I want proof now! 
Say something to your partner. 
Meier, are you okay? 
Satisfied? 
Renee told me you were ready to take your organization to the next level. 
Apparently, she was wrong. 
Not necessarily. 
I'm willing to reconsider the situation. 
The only thing you should consider yourself is lucky. 
And I still want this deal to happen. 
Otherwise, you'd be dead. 
You try something like this again, we're going to war, and that's the last thing you want. 
Let me talk to my man. 
Fine. 
(breathing heavily) Yes? 
Bring him back here. 
Are you sure? 
Yeah. 
He wants to see you. 
Get up. 
Move to the driver's-side door. 
Slowly. 
Get in. 
I'm sorry, Oleg. 
(footsteps approaching) Leave us. 
I couldn't let him die. 
He's my brother. 
And he's my son. 
Do you think this is any easier for me? 
It would've worked. 
The doctor was treating him. 
You disobeyed me, Josef. 
You put this family at risk. 
You put this family at risk when you sent those men into the clinic. 
They killed three people! 
What do you think's gonna happen when the police start to investigate?! 
Who are you to question my judgment? 
You are my first-born. 
You, of all people, should give me respect. 
I do respect you. 
But this time you're wrong. 
The doctor said that Oleg could be treated. 
He showed me how! 
All we need is the medicine! 
There are rules, Josef. 
(grunts) They are simple rules. 
(Josef grunts) And they must never be broken! 
Never endanger the family; never. 
And never disobey an order from your father. 
Papa... (speaks Russian) 
JOSEF: No, please, No, please. 
You made me do this, Josef. 
Please. Please don't. 
I'm sorry, my son. 
Get up. 
Get up! 
Now, call Father Gregor. 
He'll pray over Oleg. 
When he's finished, we'll bury your brother. 
Never disobey me again.

u know him, don't you? 
Mr. Prady, we are in the middle 
of a national security crisis. 
I have to go back to my desk. 
Okay, perhaps if I talk to your supervisor, he could let you take a few minutes off. 
It's over. 
The parole officer looking for Kevin is here in CTU. 
He's after the raw feed. 
I'm gonna give it to him, Cole. 
Why don't you wait? 
Do you hear me? 
He knows everything; he'll go to Hastings. 
Do what he says and you won't get hurt. 
Who is he? 
Another traitor? 
The only traitor is your father. 
We haven't disabled the American radiological detectors yet. 
Where are the nuclear rods? 
They're still outside the city. 
How will you bring the rods to me? 
It's been taken care of. 
Let's go! 
Stop them! 
Tarin, no! 
Oh! 
Mr. Hastings, you better 
take this; it's Kayla Hassan! 
She's in a car; she's escaped. 
They tried to kill me, but Tarin got me out. 
They shot him. 
He told me to call CTU! 
Ms. Hassan, 
my name is Jack Bauer. 
We need to know where you were being held. 
We got the location, Jack. 
Targets are heading north on Orchard. 
They're getting into an SUV. 
We ID'd one of the targets as Tarin Faroush; Kayla said he sacrificed himself to save her, but he's still alive. 
Chloe, the car that Tarin got into-- where is it now? 
Taking the first exit off the Williamsburg Bridge. 
You've gotta put Hastings on now. 
I'm on, Jack. 
You cannot let Kayla Hassan in. 
The terrorists faked her escape. 
They wanted to get her to CTU. 
She's in the tunnel. 
Stop the car! 
Whoa, whoa! 
Put your hands where we can see them! 
It's an EMP! 
What the hell's happening? 
Contact NSA. 
Terrorists just took down CTU. 
Central comm node is totally fried. 
Reroute to peripherals. 
I already tried that. 
Try again, Chloe. 
Sir, I can't give you the status on the drones. 
Everything's down. 
Which means what? 
That they're going to fall out of the sky? Not yet. 
The nav systems should default to autopilot. 
They'll circle until they run out of gas. 
But we've lost all aerial surveillance and radiological detection capability. 
Basically. 
All right. 
Agent Skaggs is heading outside on foot. 
Have him contact FAA with the drones' default flight paths. 
They need to be taken down before they crash into populated areas. 
Yes, sir. 
Are you okay? 
Am I okay? 
An EMP just took us out of play and now we're dropping the ball on a radiological threat against New York City. 
So, no, Chloe, I am not okay. 
And I won't be until we find those rods. 
Sir, Kayla Hassan is finished in Medical. 
Okay, I need her taken back to the UN so she can be evacuated with her family. 
Okay, I'll do it. 
No, I'll do it. 
I need you to assemble division heads. 
Tell them that we have a briefing in ten minutes. 
Tell them to come with full damage assessment reports. 
Sir, their systems are down. 
They can't generate reports. 
Then tell them to use a pen and a damn legal pad. 
Phil Holden. 
Phil, it's Jack Bauer. 
Ah, Jack, I heard you were back in play. 
Phil, look, I don't have a lot of time, I need you to listen to me carefully. 
Go ahead. There's an IRK 
splinter cell trying to smuggle weapons-grade uranium into the city. 
Yeah, I just read the threat assessment. 
It says you've got a CTU team tracking them. 
We did, but we lost them. 
CTU just got hit by some electromagnetic pulse device, wiped out all our visual and comm. 
I want you to try and locate our hostiles with one of your satellites. 
We don't have any birds over the metro area, Jack. 
All aerial surveillance was being routed through CTU. 
What about traffic cams? 
I can try. 
Give me the hostiles' last location. 
They got off the Williamsburg Bridge at the West Broadway/ Roebling Street exit. 
They're driving a gray SUV. 
I'll call you if we get a hit. 
Phil, I also need you to shut down all bridge and tunnel traffic into the city. 
Thanks. 
Done. 
Where are you going? 
NSA's shutting all bridge and tunnel traffic into the city. 
There's only one way for them to get in. 
Across the East River. 
That's right. 
CTU is down. 
You have confirmation? 
I have a real-time uplink to the power grid. 
It recorded a pulse surge and now nothing. 
CTU is blind, deaf, and dumb. 
Have you secured this area? 
As you ordered. 
You've done well, Ali. 
Thank you, sir. 
Load the rods into the Zodiac. 
I realize this was very difficult for you, but Hassan's daughter was a necessary sacrifice. 
Using her was the only way for us to get the rods into the city. 
Agents Beck and Henderson will escort you back to the UN. 
First, tell me what's going on. 
Agent Beck will brief you on the way. 
Now, once you're there, we need you to do something for us. 
Your father gave us a file of IRK covert agents operating in this country. 
We need you to identify the men working with Tarin. 
I'm not doing anything until you tell me what's happening. 
The car you drove here was rigged with an EMP device. 
It's a pulse weapon designed to disarm electronics. 
It's crashed all our systems. 
I don't understand. 
Tarin put me in that car. 
He used you, Ms. Hassan. 
He staged your escape, put you in that car, and sent you back here. 
But he was shot. 
I saw him. 
He is alive. 
We spotted him a few minutes ago. 
I know it's a lot to take in, but you need to go with these agents back to the UN and start looking through those files. 
You've seen these terrorists. 
If you can help us to ID them, we stand a chance of finding them before they carry out their attack. 
Ahman has prepared the bomb. 
It'll be short work once we get the rods across the river. 
MAN (over radio): A vehicle is coming. 
Where is it? 
It's coming from the east. 
Black SUV, no markings. 
How many men have you got covering? 
Three. 
Wait until the SUV's in the range, then take them out. 
Ali! Come! 
Hold on. 
What is it? 
Thought I caught something in the infrared. 
Heat source down by the water. 
Now it's gone. 
See if NYPD can get some units down here. 
I'll contact NSA, see if they've got surveillance of the area. 
That's weird. 
I got four bars, but the call's not going through. 
Me neither. 
We're being jammed. 
They're here. Damn it! 
Get down now! 
(engine cranking) Come on! 
The engine's down. 
Pass your weapons up front! 
Cole, I want you to take the sniper to your north. 
Maintain coverage until we're clear. 
I want both of you to get ready to unload all the weapons from the back, you ready? 
Yes, sir. 
Let's go, go, go! 
How did they know where to look for us? 
They must have followed us from the vault. 
Cole, use your infrared! 
Call out the snipers as you see them! 
Ten o'clock, high and low! 
I'm counting four men. 
I recognize one from the hospital. 
He was the one that talked Marcos out of detonating the vest. 
It's Jack Bauer. 
Ex-CTU. He was one 
of their best agents. 
Nine o'clock low! 
We can still cross with the rods. 
As long as we're certain Bauer and his men cannot warn anyone. 
It's not a risk. 
We started jamming their communications as soon as they were in sight. 
Now they can't leave. 
Not with the snipers in position. 
Good. 
Make sure none of them get out alive. 
I'll call you when we're across the river. 
Let's move. 
Reloading! 
I've got two men, leaving the dock in a boat. 
One of them is Tarin Faroush. 
They're carrying a box the right size and shape for the rods, Jack. 
Copy that! 
Went out of my range. 
We got to notify NYPD before they cross the river. 
I tried cell and radio frequencies. 
They're all jammed. 
There's a call box mounted on the building. Ten o'clock. 
It's gotta be a hard line. 
We can call from there. 
How do we get there? 
The way the shooters are positioned, they'll pick us off one by one as soon as we step out from behind the vehicle. 
Our vehicle's armored. 
We can pull the panels, use them for coverage. 
Start now! 
Eleven o'clock, Jack! 
Casualty reports are also coming in. 
Three fatalities from the bomb blast in the motor pool tunnel. 
Damn it. 
What else? 
Minor injuries for the most part. 
Agent McCallan was burned in a small electrical fire. 
How is he? 
He's going to be okay. 
But with our infirmary down we had to transport him to the local hospital. 
Says here we have flooding. 
Yes, sir, the pumps are down, and certain sections of the basement have about six inches of water. 
Well, can you stop it or are we all going to drown? 
The repair crew's working on it, sir. 
Okay, give me another update in 20 minutes. 
Excuse me, sir? 
Yes, what is it? 
A team from NSA is here. 
NSA? 
Brian Hastings, director of CTU. 
Frank Haynam, senior engineer at the New York field office. 
I understand you've been hit by an EMP. 
Yeah, that's right. 
I hope that you're here to help because we can damn well use it. 
We are indeed. 
Brought my best men with me. 
I thought we'd start by restoring your aerial surveillance and communications. 
So, where's your server room? 
It's downstairs. 
I'll let my maintenance team know what you're here. 
You boys can put your heads together. 
I prefer to work with my own people. 
There's no one more familiar with this facility than my crew. 
Not exactly true. 
I was part of the group that helped design this place. 
Can't say I'm thrilled with what you've done with it. 
How did you find out we were hit? 
Jack Bauer called our regional headquarters. 
Told us your situation. 
Bauer was pursuing the men behind this attack when we lost contact with him. 
Do you know where he is? 
NSA's been trying to call him back. 
He's not answering. 
They're not sure why. 
Right this way. 
Chloe, we're supposed to be writing damage assessments. 
What are you doing? 
There might be away to tap in, get some of our systems up and running. 
Really? How? 
I haven't figured it out yet, and I won't if you keep talking to me. 
All right, people, listen up. 
This is Frank Haynam, senior engineer of the NSA's New York field office. 
Now, he and his team are going to help us restore aerial surveillance and communications. 
So we can get back to tracking the nuclear rods. 
They also brought along a fresh batch of cell phones. 
Give them your full cooperation. 
Whatever they need, make it happen. 
Now, we have been knocked down, but I promise you, we are going to get back up. 
Let's get to work. 
Agent Blochard, can you get Mr. Haynam and his team 
down to the server room? 
Has NSA heard from Jack? 
Yeah. They spoke with Jack 
and his team about 20 minutes ago, but haven't been able to reach him since. 
Why not? 
They don't know. 
He could be in some kind of trouble. 
You need to send men out looking for him. 
Even if I had agents available, I wouldn't know where to send them. 
Jack was heading toward the East River. 
That's four square miles of real estate too much for me to commit resources that we don't have. 
He was pursuing the terrorists. 
He's our best chance at stopping this attack. 
We're going to focus on our efforts here. 
When we get our eyes and ears back, we'll find them. 
It might be too late. 
If anyone can take care of themselves, it's Jack. 
Now, I want you to go to the server room, make sure Haynam has everything he needs. 
Worse than I thought. 
90% of these components are fried. 
We're going to have to swap them out and install new server boards. 
Mr. Haynam. 
I'm Chloe O'Brian. 
Mr. Hastings wanted me to make 
sure you have everything you need. 
We're fine, Ms. O'Brian. Thank you. 
You're going in through the CLR processor? 
That's right. 
We're going to isolate it from the main servers and create a brand-new subnet. 
Creating a brand-new subnet from scratch? 
That'll take forever. 
Ms. O'Brian, thanks 
for offering your help. 
We'll take it from here. 
Look, I think there's another way. 
I've been looking at the CTU schematics. 
Why not tap directly into the trunk line? 
Because I'm not insane. 
Mr. Haynam, we need to make sure 
those nuclear rods don't get into the city. 
What I'm suggesting wille a lot faster. 
Yeah, and it could make things a whole lot worse. 
How could things be any worse? 
You reopen that trunk line without system buffers in place, you could cause an overload, wind up electrocuting yourself, not to mention starting a fire that canurn down half the building. 
I'm aware of the risks. 
I think I can create a workaround. 
You couldn't keep an EMP from taking out your whole operation. 
Forgive me if I don't bow to your expertise. 
If you'd stop with the cheap insults and just listen to me. 
Look, I'm not here to brainstorm. 
I'm here to clean up your mess. 
You need to leave. 
Now. 
I said now, Ms. O'Brian. 
I won't ask you again. 
Start prepping the CLR for a diagnostic. 
Arlo, is there any other way to get into the trunk line besides the server room? 
No, that's the only way in. Why? 
I think I have a faster way to get us back online, but Haynam says it's too dangerous. 
I think he's a raging egomaniac. 
Seems to be a prerequisite for engineers these days. 
You talk to Hastings? 
If I tell Hastings, he'll just shoot me down. 
Maybe not. 
And maybe the moon will fall from the sky. 
Just let it go. 
These NSA guys seem to know what they're doing. 
And if they don't, what happens to Jack? 
What's Jack got to do with this? 
(sighs) Never mind. 
Hello? 
Renee, it's Chloe. 
Where are you? 
I'm at Jack's apartment. 
What's going on? 
Everything. 
All of our systems CTU was hit bare down. 
It's a real mess. 
How did that happen? 
I can't go into it right now, but we think the terrorists were trying to take out our radiological detectors. 
Where's Jack? 
That's why I'm calling you. 
I think he might be in some kind of trouble. 
We need to find him. 
Slow down, Chloe. 
Uh, what-what do you mean? 
What-what kind of trouble? 
Jack was tracking the terrorists when the EMP hit. 
Uh, whHe called NSA, mean? 
and they lost contact, too. 
Does Hastings know about this? 
He's the one who told me. 
What's he doing about it? 
Nothing. 
He won't send anyone out to look for them. 
He says he can't spare the men and that Jack can take care of himself. 
Where was Jack before you lost contact? 
He took the first exit off the Williamsburg Bridge. 
I'm going to try to find him, Chloe. 
You need to get CTU back online as soon as you can. 
Once you acquire Jack's position, you can direct me to him. 
Yeah, well, that might take a while. 
NSA brought in a repair team and they're going about it all wrong. 
I have a faster way to get us back online. 
Well, then tell them. 
I tried. 
They won't listen. 
Then you need to make them listen, Chloe. 
Do what you have to do. 
Okay. I will. 
Call me when you're back up. 
The EMP took out all of our systems. 
And since we don't know how long it's going to be until we're up and running again, we're going to have to evacuate all nonessential personnel. 
You're going to follow Agent Combs through our access tunnel. 
I need to speak with Mr. Prady, please. 
Thank you. 
Please. 
Yeah. 
I'm really sorry that it took me so long to get back to you. 
I've been a little busy. 
I know. They briefed me 
on what happened. 
It's a terrible thing. 
Yes. 
And I have some bad news because of it. 
The surveillance video that you wanted has been erased by the EMP. 
Erased? 
Yes. 
Everything in the building has been fried. 
Well, that's a damn shame. 
So what you're telling me is whoever helped Kevin Wade rob that evidence locker they just caught a huge break. 
I'm afraid so. 
Are you sure that it was all erased, Ms. Walsh? 
I mean, don't you have a backup system? 
Yes, yes, we do, but it's on-site. 
And like I told you, all the servers have been wiped clean. 
I know how much Kevin means to you. 
I really wish I could do more. 
So you're sure that there's nothing else you can tell me? 
Anything that would help me find Kevin? 
Believe me, I have told you everything that I know. 
I'm sure you have. 
Mr. Prady, I really have 
to get back to work. 
Good luck finding Kevin. 
I hope that he's okay. 
Me, too. 
If anything changes with those files, I'll be in Little Rock. 
You have my number. 
Of course. 
I hope you get your lights back on. 
Mr. Haynam, I think 
I found a way to deal with the safety concerns you had with my idea. 
Here's the workaround. 
I thought I made myselear. 
We're not going anywhere near that trunk line. 
I'm going to ask you one last time. 
We really need to do this my way. 
We have agents in the field who are close to finding the nuclear rods and they need our help. 
And I'm going to ask you one last time. 
Get out of here. 
Get out or I'll call security! 
You get out. 
Now. 
What the hell... 
All of you, get out now. 
Look, look, take a second to think. 
Do you really want to do this? 
Mr. Haynam, 
I don't want to hurt you. 
You're probably an okay guy when you're not at work. 
And you're wearing a wedding ring. 
I swear to God, if you don't leave right now, I will shoot you. 
Get out! 
Go! 
Go get Hastings and tell him to bring security. 
They're starting to flank us! 
We're almost there! 
Jack, they're almost on us. 
We cannot stay here! 
Just give me one more second. 
Okay... 
Okay, I'm ready. 
We're gonna use these plates to form a way so that we can make it over to the call box. 
Remember, we need to move slow and steady. 
It is imperative that we stick together for this to work. 
You understand? 
Yes, sir. 
No matter how difficult it gets out there, this armor is gonna protect us. 
You need to trust that. 
Yes, sir. 
Yes. Okay. 
Cole, you're with Agent King. 
Owen, you're with me. 
Let's go! 
The armor's not gonna hold up. 
Yes, it is. 
Maintain formation. 
Can you get a shot? 
Not from this angle. 
It's not holding up. 
We gotta go for it. 
Yes, it is. Slow down! 
We're almost there. Move! 
No! 
No, no! 
(King groaning) There's nothing we can do for him now. 
We can't just leave him there. 
I'm with Owen. 
We don't leave our men behind. 
You try and bring him in now, you're dead. 
They're trying to draw us out. 
Best thing we can do for him is make it to the hard line and try and call for help. 
We're almost there. 
You cover the north, Owen the east. 
I can get there. 
Owen! 
Owen! 
Cover him! 
I'm sorry. 
I couldn't leave him behind. 
You did great. 
Is he all right? 
Did he make it? 
Did he make it?! 
Yeah, he made it. 
Come on. Stay with me. 
Stay with me. 
Jack, they're repositioning. 
Stay on them. 
Are you all right? 
Yes. 
Are you sure? 
Yes, Mother, I'm okay. 
I'm so sorry, Father. 
(sobbing): I'm so sorry. 
You were right about Tarin. 
I should have listened to you. 
You are safe. 
That's what's important. 
Mr. President, 
CTU is preparing a subterranean evacuation route. 
If there is a radiological attack, you'll be shielded underground. 
When do we leave? 
As soon as possible. 
President Taylor's waiting for you with the other delegates. 
The files Mr. Hastings 
requested are inside. 
Thank you, sir. 
Kayla, go with them. 
She's strong. 
She'll be all right. 
We almost lost her. 
And I... almost lost you. 
All for a peace agreement that could fall apart at any moment. 
And it will only get more difficult, Dalia. 
My enemies will be waiting for me once we return home. 
Omar... 
Despite everything that's happened, there's one thing I've never doubted. 
That what you are doing here is an absolute good. 
You have to be strong, too. 
We need to get in there fast before O'Brian can do any more damage. 
I understand the situation, Mr. Haynam. 
How long? 
I just need to drill into the locking mechanism. 
It shouldn't take more than a couple minutes. 
This woman is out of her mind. 
Where the hell do you find these people, Hastings? 
I can't believe she pulled a weapon on me. 
She was ready to use it, too. 
I seriously doubt that. 
I'm sure she was just trying to scare you. 
Yeah? Well, she did 
a very good job. 
You wanted to see me, sir? 
Yes, O'Brian's going off the deep end. 
She thinks she knows how to get the CTU up and running. 
But she's locked herself in the server room to do it. 
We'll be in there in a few seconds. 
What's she trying to do? 
She's trying to tap directly into the trunk line, which I don't have to tell you, is a catastrophe waiting to happen, Stop what you're doing, Chloe! 
Let's see the gun. 
Okay, don't shoot or anything. 
I know what I did is crazy. 
I know I'm in a lot of trouble. 
You're damned right. 
I wouldn't have done it if I didn't think it could work. 
I'm almost done. 
I just need ten more minutes. 
Get her out of here now. 
Do me a favor: let me give the orders. 
She pulled a gun on me! 
I know what she did. 
Now just shut up and let me handle it. 
Chloe, what in the hell were you thinking? 
Jack's looking for those nuclear rods and he might need our help. 
I can get satellite and comm back up. 
I just need to finish tapping into that trunk line. 
I told Mr. Haynam, 
but he wouldn't listen. 
So I pulled a gun on him. 
I didn't want to. 
I don't even like guns. 
Dana, what's your take on this? 
Mr. Haynam is right. 
Tapping into the trunk line is dangerous and there's no guarantee that it'll work. 
What about Cole? 
He could be in trouble. 
Aren't you worried about him? 
Yes, I am. That's why I can't 
go along with your plan. 
It's reckless. 
I'm sorry, Chloe. 
You've never been my biggest fan. 
Why start now? 
Look, it's not as dangerous as they're saying. 
I've taken precautions. 
This can work. 
I just need ten minutes. 
If I can't get the systems online by then, fine, arrest me. 
When you brought me on for this job, you said it was because I didn't think like anyone else. 
Ever since I got here, I've been punished for that. 
I've been right more than once today. 
I think I've proven myself and I think I deserve that ten minutes. 
Ten minutes. 
Thank you, sir. 
You can't be serious about this. 
You need any help? 
No, just let me work. 
All right, let's give the lady some space. 
That's all, gentlemen. 
You are making a huge mistake. 
Maybe, but I'm willing to take that chance. 
O'Brian proved herself today. 
I want to see what she comes up with. 
I'd appreciate it if you and your men would stand by. 
Yes? 
What is it? Sir, there's a man 
here who wants to speak with you-- Bill Prady. 
He says he's a probation officer. 
Probation officer? 
From Arkansas, sir. 
What does he want? 
He didn't say. 
Put him in Holding 2. 
Tell him I'll be there in 15 minutes. 
All right. 
Dana, stay here in case O'Brian needs anything. 
I'll be in my office. 
Yes, sir. 
Mr. Hastings, are you there? 
We're here, Chloe. 
What's your status? 
I'm into the trunk line. 
I'm about to activate the bypass circuit. 
Okay, what can we expect? 
Well, if I don't electrocute myself, some of our primary systems should start booting up. 
All right, whenever you're ready. 
We've got power to comm. 
And one of the sat links is back online. 
All right, that's good enough. 
Start looking for Bauer. 
Okay, Chloe, it's working. 
You all right? 
I just need a few more minutes. 
I'll be right there. 
Okay. 
Mr. Hastings, one more thing. 
If you do locate Jack, you need to call Renee Walker. 
Walker? 
She went out looking for him. 
She should be in the vicinity. 
Will do. 
Why don't you go see if Miss O'Brian needs a hand? 
And be civil this time. 
Come on, Owen. 
Stay with me. 
Stay with me. 
He's gone. 
I lost two of the snipers. 
If we're gonna make a move, we got to do it soon, Jack. 
We can't lay down cover fire for something we can't see. 
We need to give them something to shoot at. 
I'll make a break to the north, try and draw their fire, you make a run for the call box. 
But that's a suicide play, Jack. 
You'll never make it. 
But you will. 
No. 
I can't let you do that. 
I'm in command here. 
That's what gonna happen. 
Do you understand? 
Yeah. 
I need you to do me a favor. 
What is it? 
You make sure that Hastings keeps his promise. 
That he doesn't bring Renee back in. 
I give you my word. 
You're not gonna have long before they start firing on you. 
Good luck, Jack. 
You make it to that call box. 
Clear! 
Jack? Jack?! 
Jack? 
(gasps) It's okay. 
It's okay. It's me. 
It's Renee. 
It's okay. 
(groans) It's okay. 
Shh. 
(panting) They got the fuel rods in a boat. 
They're heading across the river into the city. 
I can't breathe. 
Shh. 
It's okay. 
Nothing went through. 
Relax. You may have 
a collapsed lung... 
Jack, I got through to CTU. 
They just got back online. 
NYPD's sending choppers. 
We still got a real good shot at finding them. 
Mr. Hastings, I just got 
a call from Agent Ortiz. 
The nuclear rods are on a Zodiac with two of the terrorists aboard. 
They were heading northwest across the river toward the city. 
Where are the choppers? 
One second. 
They just arrived at the port. 
Okay, redirect them. 
Start diverting all available NYPD units to that shoreline. 
We need to lay down a cordon. 
Yes, sir. 
Chloe? 
Thanks. You-You were... 
I'm not good with praise. 
What do you think you're doing, going to my boss? 
My job. 
I've answered all your questions. 
Why won't you just leave? 
I can't do that. 
I know you were involved with that robbery, Ms. Walsh. 
What? 
I think you know exactly where Kevin is. 
I think you're protecting him. 
You are out of your mind. 
And you're a liar. 
I'm not leaving here until I know the truth. 
This'll go a lot smoother for you if you just come clean right now. 
It's not too late, Miss Walsh. 
But I promise you, if you don't, I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall. 
Contact CTU. 
See if they picked 'em up going across the river. 
It's me. 
CTU's back online. 
I know. There are helicopters 
searching the river. 
They're getting close. 
You should have warned us earlier. 
I didn't have time. 
I was too busy preserving my cover. 
I don't know how much longer I'll be able to stay under. 
I thought you took care of that problem. 
So did I. 
It came back. 
Well, we can't stay here. 
The police must already be cordoning off the area. 
We're going to need your help getting clear. 
I will get you out of there. 
Don't worry. 
Stand by. 
I'll call you in a few minutes. 
Tell me what you know. 
The hitter has someone on the inside. 
Victor Aruz told me right before he died that the assassin's working with someone very close to President Hassan. 
Someone hacked into the U.N. database. 
They downloaded the security protocols, the schematics to the U.N. 
and Hassan's personal itinerary. 
Did you get a name? 
The computer's owner is listed as Meredith Michelle Reed. 
She's a reporter. 
Applied for security clearance at the U.N. 
We got a match. 
Everybody move back! 
Move back! 
Mr. President. 
I can't believe she's part of this. 
If this affair becomes public, it will destroy your credibility and everything that you've worked for. 
I just spoke to my brother. 
I told him to deny the affair. 
The reporter's claims need to be discredited. 
CTU needs to continue to think she's my contact on the inside. 
We might have the wrong person. 
We've been scanning through the traffic cam footage from outside Meredith Reed's apartment building. 
This man was going into the service entrance. 
What if he went through her apartment and used her laptop to break into the servers? 
He hailed a cab when he left. 
See the medallion? 
Phone the cab company. 
Find out where it went. 
Hands in the air now! Against the wall! 
Chloe tracked the man in the surveillance photo to a second location. 
We didn't think you'd follow through with an investigation. 
So you had no choice except to steal weapons from the armory. 
Would you follow through with an investigation if I'd asked? 
I'm not debating this anymore. 
You want to waste your time chasing ghosts, knock yourself out. 
Hello? 
"Dana Walsh." I like that. 
I told you to stop calling me. 
Yeah, I know what you told me, Jenny. 
You must be mistaking me for someone else. 
That's funny 'cause you sound a lot like this girl I used to know from Rock Springs named Jenny Scott. 
Hey, Mike, what's going on? 
Mind if I come in? 
Oh, Mikey. 
Call Captain Ravello. 
Tell him you're sick, and I'm filling in for you. 
Now listen, you son of a bitch, there's no way... 
What's the matter with you?! 
Next time I won't miss the bone. 
Make... the call. 
This is Hastings. 
Tell me you've gotten something out of  that reporter you arrested. 
 No, sir. 
I'm continuing to press her, but she's maintaining her innocence. 
She's a co-conspirator in an assassination plot. 
Of course she's gonna deny it. 
Listen, I need to be able to tell the president we're making progress toward averting this threat. 
Sir, right now our only course is to go after Meredith Reed with the evidence we have in hand. 
Our top analyst is decrypting a file we obtained from her laptop. 
We're hoping it provides the intel we need about the assassin she's working with. 
Well, it'd better provide something because if your people fail, and President Hassan is killed, this peace process dies with him. 
Do you understand me? 
I understand your concern, Mr. Weiss, 
but I assure you we're on top of the situation. 
I've dispatched tactical personnel to liaise with U.N. security forces 
and stepped up the alert with NYPD at the perimeter. 
Fine. I'll have that 
to tell her at least. 
Let me know when that file is decrypted. 
Dana, you got a minute? 
I thought you were on your way to the U.N. 
I am. What's the status 
on that file decryption? 
We I.D.'d the cipher. 
It's a standard Issacs-Adler algorithm. 
Requires a 12-character decryption key to unlock the data. 
The search cycle has identified two characters already. 
Should have the rest in about 30 or 40 minutes. 
Why do you ask? 
Jack Bauer just caused a big scene with Hastings. 
He thinks Meredith Reed may have been framed. 
He must have gotten that from Chloe. 
I thought that she'd dropped it. 
Apparently not. 
She has surveillance of someone exiting Reed's apartment building. 
Jack thinks this same person may have planted the encrypted file  on Reed's computer. 
 You believe that? 
I'm not sure. 
If that evidence was planted, the file you're decrypting is irrelevant at best; at worst a misdirection. 
Cole, I traced the U.N. 
breach to Reed myself. 
The biometric scans of her interrogation all indicate that she's withholding. 
I just don't see a frame here. 
I hope you're right because Jack's going after this guy on his own. 
Hastings sanctioned that? 
Not exactly. 
Agent Ortiz? We need to move out, sir. 
Be careful. 
Don't worry. 
Okay, I'm at the corner of Broadway and West 23rd in Queens. Any location on the suspect? 
Negative. I talked to 
the cab driver directly. 
All he remembers is dropping the fare at the corner. 
Nothing shows up in the aerial archives. 
Chloe, I need something to go on. 
I know. I've been searching 
for private security cameras in the area. 
Not all of them are registered. 
Without the serial numbers, I don't have access to them. 
Okay, I'm gonna get out and look around on foot. 
Maybe we'll get lucky. Stay on the line. 
It's all right, Mags. 
It's gonna be okay, right? 
Keep your hand on the table where I can see it. 
Who the hell are you? 
You're not a cop. 
How did you manage to fool everybody, Mikey, or whatever the hell your name is? 
Talk to me, you son of a bitch! 
Shh-shh-shh. 
Look, I don't want to hurt you, Jim, or Maggie. 
I am just doing my job. 
This is the captain calling back. 
Just say what I told you to say. 
Please don't make me do anything I don't want to do. 
Okay? 
Yeah. 
Hello. 
Koernig, Captain Ravello. What's up? 
Uh, yeah, Captain, sorry to drop this on you last-minute. 
I just came down with some kind of bug. 
I got to take a sick leave. 
You could have told me earlier, Jim. 
You're due at the U.N. in 20. 
Yeah, I know. It's okay. 
I asked Mike Farmer to cover my shift for me. 
Farmer's already on in the morning. 
He said he doesn't mind working a double. 
I guess he could use the time-and-a-half. 
Anyway, I already told him he could use the bike that I pulled from the motor pool. 
All right, Sergeant. 
I'll take care of the paperwork. 
Look, you tell Mike to get his butt to Midtown. 
You got that? 
Get better, will ya? 
Yeah. 
You did well. 
I did what you wanted me to do, all right, so... 
Do what you got to do and leave us alone. 
We're not gonna make any trouble for you. 
You still there? 
Jack, go ahead. 
Hold on. Hold on. 
Okay, I got two security cameras overlooking the park, one pointing straight at the corner. 
I'm gonna get you the serial numbers. 
Hey, man, what you doing? 
Chloe, I got to get back to you. 
What's up? You lost, man? 
Actually, I am. 
I'm looking for a friend of mine. 
Well, unless you a cop, I suggest look somewhere else, 'cause this is our court. 
We don't like strangers on it. 
I ain't a cop, and I'm not looking for a problem. 
My friend was let off on that corner by a cab 20, 25 minutes ago. 
I guess you didn't hear what I'm saying, did you? 
I've got a hundred bucks; anybody can tell me if they've seen this guy. 
Anybody? 
I seen him. 
Yo, shut up, Jay! 
What was he wearing? 
Green coat, black shirt. 
Where'd he go? 
That light blue house over there across the street. 
I seen him go up the steps to the stoop. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah, I'm sure. 
Yo, man, what you doing, Jay?! 
You don't even know what's going down. 
Man, I don't know about you, but I got a hundred dollars. 
It's your play. Let's go. 
Man, I'm about to take that hundred dollars. 
Give me the ball, man. 
All right. 
Jim! 
Hello. Jack? 
Got a call from one of your neighbors. 
Jim? 
Hello, Jack? 
Jack, what's happening? 
Are you there...? 
Put the weapon down now. Do it. 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
I'm working on behalf of CTU. 
I'm investigating a threat to the peace conference at the U.N. If that's true, 
drop your weapon. 
I can't. 
The man I'm pursuing killed two people in this house. 
If I lower this weapon, I'll be sidelined. 
That can't happen. 
What are you doing? He's down. 
Son of a bitch is a cop killer. 
John, stop! We got to call this in. 
Not yet we don't. 
Help me get him in. 
Come on! Help me get him in! 
So where are we? 
As of right now, we've got half the decryption key. 
That's all? 
Can't we accelerate the program? 
It's already running at capacity, sir. 
 Mr. Hastings. 
 Sir, we just found this among Meredith Reed's personal effects. 
It's a dedicated key card, United Nations issue. 
Issued to who? 
President Hassan and his family. 
It accesses their private residence. 
We got her. 
Dana Walsh. 
Ms. Walsh, this is security 
at Perimeter Gate 9. You have a visitor. 
A visitor? 
A Mr. Kevin Wade. 
Says he's a friend of yours. 
Ms. Walsh? 
Tell him I'll be right there. 
So this, uh... this CTU... 
some kind of government deal, huh? 
Law enforcement? 
Ms. Walsh is on her way. 
Thanks. 
Hey, Dana. 
Look at you, all pressed and pretty. 
I think I like you as a blonde. 
What are you doing here? 
I thought I told you to leave me alone. 
And I told you not to hang up on me, Jenny. 
Don't. 
Don't call me that. 
Oh, you... you... you 
want me to play along? 
Okay, I'll play along. 
But I'm not going to let you pretend that you don't know me. 
Fine. 
You found me, so now what? 
You think we're just going to pick up where we left off? 
Why not? 
We had a good thing going. 
No. 
No, we didn't. 
I was naive, and I let myself be taken in by you. 
I am not that person  anymore. 
 Yeah? 
CTU. 
Senior Data Analyst. 
Well, sounds like an important job. 
I'm thinking you always were the smart one. 
How the hell did you pull this off? 
What, you steal a dead girl's birth certificate or something? 
Look, I have money. 
Not a lot, but some. 
If that's what it'll take. 
If you really still care about me, you'll leave me alone. 
Say my name. 
What? 
If you're gonna beg, I want to hear you say my name. 
Just like you used to. 
Kevin. 
Say, "Please, Kevin." 
Please... Kevin. 
There's my bad girl. 
Damn it! What do you want from me?! 
A place to crash for starters. 
 I'm getting a little tired of living out of the van. 
 No, that is not gonna happen. 
Yeah? Well, now you don't want me... 
to tell everyone you work with your little secret now, do you? 
You see, I don't want to do that. 
Come on. 
It'll be fun having me around. 
It'll be just like old times. 
You'll come home... 
...and we'll catch up. 
Fine, fine. 
You can stay the night. 
I want you out tomorrow. 
Whatever you say. 
Do you want my address? 
I already got it. 
I'm going to ask you again, Ms. Reed, 
and this time I want an answer. 
Now we know that this key card was issued to President Hassan and his family at the U.N. 
I want to know where you got it. 
I'm not saying another word until my attorney gets here. 
You're already looking at a life sentence in a federal penitentiary. 
So if this plot succeeds and Hassan dies, I promise you the death penalty. 
If you give me the name of the assassin, maybe we can cut a deal. 
 I told you I don't know anything. 
 You know who you stole his key card from. 
I didn't steal it. 
Then you manufactured it, cloned it somehow! 
No. 
And used it to gain access  to the U.N. security data. 
 I, I... 
Where did you get it?! Tell me! 
He gave it to me. 
Who? 
Who?! 
Omar. 
Omar gave it to me. 
President Hassan? 
Why would he do that? 
So I could have access to his private residence when he wanted to be alone with me. 
You really expect me to believe that you're involved with him? 
Believe what you want. It's the truth. 
This is Hastings. 
Put me through to Rob Weiss at the U.N. 
What are you doing? 
I need to speak with President Taylor to get permission to talk with Omar Hassan. 
Now if there's something you want to say to me, Ms. Reed, 
now is the time to say it. 
I'm sorry, Mr. Hastings. 
Mr. Weiss is in a closed session, 
but they're expecting to break shortly. 
All right, just relay the message to have him call me back as soon as he can. 
Yes, sir. 
Looks like you have a bit more time to reconsider your story. 
You let me know when you're ready to change it. 
Mr. Hastings, I need your help. 
I've lost contact with Jack. 
He called me 15 minutes ago. 
We got cut off. 
I haven't been able to reach him since. 
This is your operation, Chloe... yours and Bauer's. 
I don't see why this should be my concern. 
He could be in some kind of trouble. 
You need to send for backup. 
Even if I wanted to, we don't have the manpower. 
I dispatched all field personnel to the U.N. 
for Hassan's protection. 
I watched the interrogation. 
I heard what Reed said about her affair with Hassan. 
If that's true, it supports our idea that she was framed. 
And how do you figure that? 
Because it explains why the biometrics registered her deception, and why the real insider within Hassan's camp chose her to divert our investigation. 
Reed is lying. 
There is no affair. 
But what if there is? 
If President Hassan corroborates Reed's claim, will you consider sending units to find Jack? 
All right, fine. 
Just so you can hear for yourself, I'll have someone alert you when Hassan calls me back. 
Is that good enough? 
No, but it's better than nothing. 
That couple you murdered upstairs were friends of mine, dirtbag. 
Good people. 
 Mazoni, you can't do this. 
 No, what I can't do is watch another creep like this walk on a technicality, or because some lawyer didn't file the right papers to the right clerk. 
 John! 
 I've seen it happen more times than I can count. 
You're new here, Phil. You don't know. 
Wait till you spend 15 years of your life grinding your teeth in this job. 
You talk to me then. 
What about that thing he said? 
 About him working with CTU? 
 Did we find credentials on him? 
 No. 
 That's because he is a lying piece of garbage. 
This was a home invasion robbery. 
Where nothing was taken. 
Because we showed up! 
Look, you got a problem with what I'm doing here, Phil? 
Then go upstairs and wait till I'm finished. 
Go. Now! 
And remember, you don't call this in until I say so. 
You stick to the story. 
He was resisting arrest. 
You got that? 
You got that? 
Just, uh... don't kill him. 
I'll do my best. 
Hey, Farmer, what are you doing here? 
Koernig called in sick. 
Stomach thing. 
No kidding? 
I talked to him this morning. 
He was feeling fine. 
Probably a few too many at lunch. 
...continue to receive 
real-time updates at the U.N. 
CTU is confirming the link between the Stinger missile attack and the assassination plot against President Hassan. 
In response, we're gonna push the traffic perimeter out another six blocks and close the Queensboro Bridge in both directions until noon tomorrow. 
Now, roadblock assignments are on pages two and three of your briefing packets. 
Go ahead and double-check those now. 
CTU has also arrested an individual inside the U.N. 
who we believe is a part of the plot. 
Hopefully, this will yield some information about the assassin himself. 
Until then, we have to assume that he could strike at any time and will stop at nothing to achieve his objective. 
He's already killed five people that we know of, including two CTU agents. 
Whoever he is, he's a professional, which means everyone is to be on high alert at all times. 
History is happening upstairs, people, and it's on our watch. 
Our position remains unchanged, Madam President. 
We will not allow NATO to transit supplies to Afghanistan through our territory. 
What about non-military supplies? 
It is our belief that any NATO deployment in the region, military or otherwise, will lead to more extremism, not less. 
Mr. President... 
uh, my director of Counterterrorism here in New York is requesting to speak to you on the phone. 
Now? 
It's an urgent matter. 
It's relating to the reporter who was arrested earlier. 
Mr. Weiss will escort you 
to the conference room. 
That is, unless you have any objections. 
No, not at all. 
This way, Mr. President. 
Do I have to remind you of our conversation? 
Omar, you must deny your involvement with this woman. 
She has a name, Farhad. 
And I still can't believe that she can be part of this plan. 
That should not be your chief concern right now. 
If word of this affair gets out, not only is your political career over, but so is the peace process itself. 
You know what you have to do. 
 Thank you. 
 Mr. President. 
Hello? 
Mr. President, 
this is Brian Hastings at CTU. 
I appreciate you getting back to me. 
What can I do for you, Mr. Hastings? 
Well, sir, I have a matter of some delicacy to discuss with you. 
 Go on. 
 Thank you, sir. 
I know that your time is valuable, so, I'll come right to the point. 
I understand Meredith Reed is writing an article on you for the Sunday Magazine. 
Yes, that's correct. 
Do you know of any reason she would be in possession of a key card to your residence at the U.N.? 
Key card? 
Yes, sir. 
She claims that she got it from you. 
And that your relationship with her is... 
perhaps more than professional. 
Mr. President? 
Is there anyone listening to our conversation, Mr. Hastings? 
Are we being recorded? 
No, sir. 
I'm speaking to you on a secure line. 
Then I will tell you what Ms. 
Reed said is true. 
Omar! 
What are you doing?! 
Sir, are you confirming a romantic involvement with Meredith Reed? 
Mr. Hastings, I trust 
your complete discretion in this matter. 
And I'm sure you understand the ramification if what I'm telling you becomes public knowledge. 
Yes, sir, I understand. 
I gave Ms. Reed this key card 
for reasons I'm sure are clear to you. 
I'm telling you all this in the interests of justice because I'm convinced that Ms. Reed is not 
part of this conspiracy. 
Excuse me for asking, sir, but are you basing that certainty on anything other than your personal feelings? 
No, I suppose not. 
I see. 
Well, thank you for your candor, Mr. President. 
I assure you that nothing we discussed will be disclosed from this office. 
I appreciate that, Mr. Hastings. 
Good-bye, then. 
Good-bye. 
Have you any idea what you've done? 
The honorable thing. 
You said you'd send backup to Jack's location. 
I said I'd consider it, and I have. 
Confirmation of the affair does not prove Reed's innocence. 
For all we know, it's a ploy she used to gain access to the U.N. security files, 
Hassan's itinerary. 
In the meantime, Jack's still missing. 
He's not missing. 
You lost contact. 
His phone battery may have died. 
Or more likely, he's in an area with bad cell reception. 
There's pockets of them all over the five boroughs, which you would have known if you were from around here. 
Fine, if you're not sending someone, I'll go myself. 
No, you won't! 
Your concern for your friend is admirable, but that file we got off Reed's laptop... 
it's almost decrypted, and depending what we find, I'm going to need you here. 
 Is that clear? 
 Yeah. 
Now, earlier today, you suggested that I speak to you more clearly and directly. 
You leave the building, you're fired. 
Is that clear and direct enough for you? 
Hello? 
We have a problem. 
My brother confessed to the affair. 
I don't know if the frame's going to hold. 
That's unfortunate. 
Don't you understand?! 
CTU won't believe the file you uploaded to Reed's computer is genuine. 
I agree it isn't ideal, but they will still have to act on what they find in any event. 
There's no reason to diverge from the plan. 
But you need to remain calm and play your part. 
How much longer? 
I promise you. 
Your brother will be dead before the hour is out. 
Don't move! 
Drop that! Now! 
Officer, everything I told you before is true. 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
 I'm a former federal agent. 
 He's lying, Phil! 
Shoot the son of a bitch! 
He broke my damn rib! 
Contact Chloe O'Brian at CTU. 
She'll verify my identity and the threat to the peace conference. 
What are you waiting for? 
Shoot him already! 
Sit back down, John. 
You want to be pointing that gun  someplace else. 
 I said don't move, either of you! 
What the hell? I'm your partner! 
No, this has gone far enough. 
I'm calling it in. 
You don't want to do that. 
Come on, Phil. Put the phone down. 
Let's talk about this. 
Shut up! 
This is Patrolman Phillip Lu. 
I need to talk to Lieutenant Sell. 
The officer upstairs has to be  connected to the assassination plot. 
 Oh, you happy now?! 
 You hearing what he's saying about Koernig? 
 All I'm saying is that there's a connection. 
We need to find out what it is. 
Both of you, shut the hell up! 
Lieutenant, sir. 
I'm at the scene of a double homicide. 
One of the victims is a cop, a James Koernig out of Midtown Center. 
No, it's definitely murder. 
Him and his wife. 
We got a suspect in custody. 
11447 Broadway. Cross street is Astoria. 
Ask him what Officer Koernig's assignment was today. 
Please, innocent lives are at stake. 
What have you got to lose? 
And, sir? 
I need a lookup on Koernig's duty assignment. 
Yeah, transfer me over. 
 You screwed up. 
 What? 
Yeah, surprised me, too. 
You forgot to upload a Rijndael filter to my system. 
Without it, I can't break the last encryption layer on the file remnant you gave me. 
I'm sorry. I will upload 
it to a disk for you now. 
Or I can just do it at your station. 
Okay, fine. 
Everything okay? 
What do you mean? I don't know. 
It's not like you to make mistakes. 
You seem a little distracted. 
Wedding jitters, maybe? 
No. 
Just asking. 
And Cole's a nice enough guy. 
But I could see how you could start having second thoughts. 
I've always been curious to know what you two  find to talk about. 
 Drop this, Arlo. I am not in the mood. 
Hey, I don't mean anything by it. 
All I'm saying is that you and the boy scout aren't exactly intellectual equals. 
Or is that what makes him your type? 
See now, you and me, for instance, we have a lot in common. 
We speak the same language. 
Mostly techno-jargon granted, but hey, it can always lead  to something much deeper. 
 Damn it, Arlo! 
That's it. 
We've got it. 
Whoa. Is that what I think it is? 
Yes. 
Finish decrypting your fragment and put it up on the screen. 
I've got to go tell Hastings. 
 I don't care what he's demanding. 
Tell Ms. Reed's lawyer 
he's going to have to wait. 
We can hold his client for up to 18 hours before formatly charging her. 
 Sir? 
 I have to go. 
We've broken the encryption code on Reed's file. 
The primary file component's up on screen. 
Arlo's waiting for a second piece to finish rendering. 
So, what am I looking at? 
Construction plans for work carried out at the United Nations eight months ago. 
 The U.N.? Are you sure? 
 Positive. 
Two I-beams were retrofitted to provide structural support for additional interpreters' booths. 
 There and there. 
 That looks like  the Council Chamber. 
 It's directly below it. 
The decryption's just about complete. 
It's loading to the main screen now. 
It looks like a schematic for an incendiary. 
A bomb. 
Pulse-detonated, modified to fit between the I-beams. 
Sir, judging by the size, that's big enough to drop the entire Security Council into the East River. 
Get me Cole and Manners at the U.N. 
All stations! 
We're implementing protocols for an immediate evacuation of the United Nations building! 
We are Code Red. 
I repeat: this is not a drill. 
We are Code Red! 
Mr. Hastings, you need to consider 
the possibility that this intel is fake and why they wanted us to find it. 
I'm not taking any chances. 
Sir, I've got Cole and Manners on the line. 
Gentlemen, we have intel from the decrypted files that an incendiary device has been placed directly below the Council Chamber. 
S... Sir, I don't see how that's possible. 
This building's been vetted for weeks. 
U.N. security have swept the 
area thoroughly and repeatedly. 
Then they missed it. 
Mr. Manners, 
you need to implement evacuation protocols immediately. 
Cole, I want you on President Hassan, personally. 
Yes, sir. 
Hey! You, you, with me! Let's go! 
Ladies and gentlemen, forgive the interruption. 
Your attention, please. 
We are evacuating immediately due to a possible bomb threat. 
Security personnel will be receiving protocol confirmation on designated channels momentarily. 
Evacuation will proceed out these doors and down to underground parking level B. 
Please, speak only with your designated handlers. 
 Omar... 
Everything will be fine, Madam President. 
Madam President, you and Secretary Kanin need to move now. 
President Hassan, if you'll follow me. 
Traffic control, I need route lockdown for northern exodus. 
All units confirm. 
Unit 2 in position. 
Unit 3 in position. 
Unit 4 in position. 
Unit 5 in position. 
Where are my wife and daughter? 
They're coming down the east stairwell now, sir. 
No more than two minutes behind you. 
I won't leav without them. 
Mr. President, with all 
due respect, my orders are to evacuate you now. 
Omar, I'll wait and go with them. Don't worry. 
I'll make sure they're safe. 
Tarin, get my brother out of here. 
All right, evac tunnel B! Move! 
Yes? 
He's in the third car. 
The motorcade's coming up the ramps now. 
Vehicles are in transit. 
Current location: evac tunnel bravo. 
Second Avenue teams should have a visual in five minutes. 
 Uncle! 
 Where's Omar? 
He went ahead. We'll take the next car. 
Is it true there's a bomb? 
It's just a precaution, Kayla. 
Don't worry. 
Everything's going to be fine. 
Right this way. 
Okay. Let's be quick. 
Hurry. 
The guy who took his place? 
What was his name? 
Mike Farmer. 
Thanks. 
Come on. Get out. 
You were right. 
There is a connection. 
Sergeant Koernig was on the U.N. security detail. 
He called in sick about 45 minutes ago. 
He was forced to make that call. 
You said someone replaced him? 
A patrolman named Mike Farmer from the same unit. 
That's your assassin. 
Officer, you need to let me call CTU, and I need to get to the U.N. immediately. 
Officer, this is going down now. 
You can either stand here and do nothing, or you can help me stop it. 
Make the call. 
I'll drive you to the U.N. 
Thank you. 
Where the hell you think you're going? 
He can't leave! 
He's a material witness! 
Jack, where have you been? 
Chloe, please just listen to me. 
The assassin killed a police officer and took his place in the U.N. security detail. 
I need to alert Agent Ortiz immediately. 
Okay. I'll patch you through. 
He's in the middle of evacuating Hassan. 
Evacuating him? Why? 
Hastings' orders. 
The evidence in Reed's computer indicated that there's a bomb in the building. 
Where's Hassan now? 
Hassan's motorcade is heading up the ramps in the parking garage, about to pull out onto Second Avenue. 
 Chloe, it's Cole. 
 Hang on. I've got Cole. 
Agent Ortiz, you're on with Jack Bauer. 
What's going on, Jack? 
Cole, you need to stop Hassan's car now! 
What are you talking about? 
The assassin is part of the evacuation detail. 
He's posing as an NYPD officer. 
There is no bomb in the U.N. 
They're just trying to lure him out of the building. 
Did you tell Hastings about this? 
We don't have time. 
You need to stop the motorcade before it hits the street. 
It's too late. Hassan's car 
just exited the tunnel. 
Cole, you need to stop that car or Hassan's a dead man. 
Cole? 
Whose vehicle is that? 
It's Cole, sir. 
Cole, what the hell are you doing? 
Cole! 
Cole! 
What was that? 
What happened? 
Cole, can you verify? Was Hassan hit? 
Cole! 
President Hassan's security forces they're still cracking down on the opposition and they're not showing any signs of letting up. 
The rumors have already started that the British are pulling out as signatories to the accord. 
Assemble the representatives. 
I want to appeal to them myself to stay the course. 
One of the suspects has family connections to a member of our delegation here at the UN. 
Who? 
Jamot. 
Are you arresting me? 
I demand to speak with President Hassan. 
President Hassan is the one who gave this order. 
What's wrong? You sound upset. 
I need to speak with you about your father. 
I have to go to the embassy right now. 
I'll meet you in private when I get back. 
This has the address and schematic of the evidence lockup. 
This keycard will get you access. 
How do we find the money? 
The evidence bins are numbered. 
Do exactly what I tell you to do, and you'll be in and out. 
No one will know you're there. 
The authorities know about the nuclear material. 
Putting Oleg in a clinic would lead them right to us. 
No doctors. 
The doctor said that Oleg could be treated. 
He showed me how. 
Who are you to question my judgment? 
Never disobey an order from your father. 
I'm sorry, my son. 
Tell me about this buyer. 
His name is Ernst Meier, German arms dealer. 
What's he looking to buy? 
Weapons-grade uranium. 
I'm going to have to meet this Meier, and I need a good-faith payment up front. 
I'm not going to tell you again. 
Leave me alone and let me get dressed. 
Damn it, come here or the deal's off. 
Meier? 
That's right. 
Where is the $5 million? 
The money is in your account. 
Drop the weapon. Now! Drop it! 
Meier. You really think you can roll me for $5 million? 
Let me talk to my man. 
Yes. 
Bring him back here. 
He wants to see you. 
Get up. 
Thank you so much. 
Well, that went well. 
Unanimous support for the treaty well, nearly unanimous, anyway. 
I have the distinct impression that I am running out of goodwill. 
Maybe, but you bought yourself some breathing room. 
These people are already up past their bedtimes. 
I don't think we'll be hearing any more grousing until tomorrow morning at the earliest. 
Congratulations, Madam President. 
Thank you, I appreciated your support. 
Good. 
Now I hope you'll explain to me what's really going on. 
I thought I did. 
You invoked national security, which, with respect, is not an explanation. 
It's saying "Don't ask." 
Madam President, our countries have a unique relationship based on a trust developed over nearly a century now. 
Anything you say to me is in the strictest confidence. 
You may tell your prime minister and no one else that President Hassan's crackdown isn't just a response to the attempt on his life. 
There are unsecured nuclear materials in play. 
Apparently a faction inside his country was so disturbed by the prospect of disarmament, they decided to take matters into their own hands. 
Where are the materials? 
Here on our soil. 
CTU is running an undercover operation to retrieve them as we speak. 
Who is that? 
My guess is, it is my backup. 
No calls till we get to Vladimir. 
Does this look like a situation where you get to make demands? 
It's Meier. 
I lost my sight line on you. 
I'm leaving the building. 
I understand. 
Everything okay? 
The money's been transferred to Vladimir's account. 
We're going to his office. We should be there in a few minutes. 
I'll follow with a backup team. 
That might not be necessary. 
After what they just pulled, you're sure you're comfortable without backup? 
There are other considerations. 
You mean they have Renee. 
That's right. 
Okay, we'll stay back. 
I'll let you know. 
What was that? 
Let him know what? 
Shut up and drive. 
Okay, I got 'em on traffic cam. 
Is everything okay? 
Jack seems to be in control. 
Looks fine, all things considered. 
Driver looks a little worried. 
Who is this guy anyway? 
Should I pass him on to facial recognition? 
Dana? 
I've got to take this. 
Yeah, sure, no biggie. 
Just unsecured nuclear materials. 
Yes. 
We're there, outside the evidence building. 
You're in the side alley, right? 
No, we parked out front so everyone can see us. 
Come on, what do you think I am? 
Okay, look, I need to walk you through this step by step. 
I know, we're ready. 
Well, something just came up here and I need you to hang on for a few minutes. 
Here? We're kind of exposed, Jenny. 
You'll be fine if you just stay still. 
We have a 30-minute window before the next security pass. 
I will be with you the second I can. 
Arlo, Hastings wants us in his office for a field update. 
Can I ask you a hypothetical question? 
If it's about Dana, it's not hypothetical. 
If your fianc� was cheating on you, would you want to know? 
Hypothetically, who'd be asking some creepy stalker who's about to get fired? 
I'm serious. 
So am I. Just go upstairs. 
It's none of your business. 
Dana, Cole just called about Jack. 
He's almost to Laitanan. 
Hastings wants us in his office. 
Pass me back the keys. 
Slowly get out, put your hands on the roof. 
Let's go. 
So this is how you do business? 
I wire you the $5 million like we agreed, and then you try and take me out. 
I did not think you were for real. 
It was a misunderstanding, but it's past. 
We are here. 
As an act of good faith, Vladimir has already started calling his contacts, inquiring about the nuclear materials. 
I don't care what he's done. 
I want to talk to you. 
So talk. 
I want to talk to my partner alone now. 
Look, he's upset, understandably. 
It will be fine. Yeah? 
This is our chance. 
We should take him out now. 
No, we need him to do this deal. 
Don't risk everything for a whore. 
You ever talk about her like that again, I'll kill you. 
You understand? 
What the hell are you doing? 
I have authorization to pull you out. 
No, that's not possible. 
Renee, you've taken us this far, I'm going to finish it. 
Jack, you can't. He doesn't trust you, first of all. 
The only reason he's agreeing to continue this is me. 
I'm fine, really. 
You want to make calls, let's go. 
You don't have a say in this. I am pulling you out. 
No, look, it's not a big deal. 
I know what he did to you six years ago, and it is a big deal. 
Jack, if we stop this now, then everything that I have done is for nothing. 
We're running out of time. 
Let's go. 
We're almost there, it'll be worth it. 
Kevin, are you there? 
Yeah. 
I thought you forgot about us. 
I wish I could. 
Come on, don't be like that. 
Are we good to go? 
Yes, move now. 
Let's go. 
There's a security panel next to the door. 
Use the keycard I gave you. 
The code is 1668. 
1668. 
166... 
Keep moving, it will stop in a second. 
If you want the $120,000 you will be out of there in less than 20 minutes. 
Okay, which door is it? 
It's the last one on the left. 
The code is 4660. 
Four... 
It's like Christmas... with chain link. 
Okay, how do we find the money? 
It's in section 3101. 
 3101. 
It's down the aisle on your left. 
 3101. 
 The code is 2824. 
The last one on the left. 
3101-- do you see it? 
Yeah, right here. 
What the hell, man? 
Jen, what the hell is going on? 
What number is it? 
Is it 3101? 
3101-- this is 3110. 
Come on. 
What is wrong with you two? 
Hey, it's called a mistake, all right? 
Back off. 
So where is it? 
3101 is down the aisle on the left. 
 Down here, down here. 
 The code is 2824. 
2824, 2824, 2824. 
Bin number's 4301. 
4301. 
Oh, man, it's too many numbers. 
4301, 4301. 
Boom! Got it! 
That's beautiful, man. 
That's beautiful. 
Just shut up and get out of there. 
The next patrol is in less than 15 minutes. 
You've got the money. 
Close the doors and leave. 
15 minutes. We're leaving. 
Call me when you're clear. 
I sure will, Jenny. 
Let's go! 
Not yet. 
Check out some of this stuff. 
Hey, seriously, come on, man. 
Patrol's on its way. 
Yeah, 15 minutes. 
Are you sure, then? 
You haven't heard of anyone dealing in these materials? 
All right. Well, thank you for your time. 
I'm sorry to trouble you. 
Nothing. 
They did not appreciate being called so late. 
Renee, cut me some bread. 
Here. 
You might want to ease up on the drinking. 
You've got some calls to make. 
I drink what I want. 
Renee, where's the bread? 
Coming. 
Drink. 
What is this? 
It is too thin. 
It should be thick. 
Nice and thick. 
There we are. 
She's changed, you know? 
Six years ago, she thought she was too good for me. 
Now, she is much more friendly. 
Maybe I should thank you all that time you were together in Mexico City. 
Come on. 
I see how you look at her. 
Don't tell me you didn't. 
You want to keep talking, do it on the phone. 
Otherwise, the nuclear materials will be gone, and this deal will be dead. 
Fine, but I don't like you breathing down my neck. 
Lugo, get him out of here. 
And I'm running out of my vodka. 
Go get me some more. 
Sit down. 
I won't be long. 
My younger son. 
I wanted to bury him, Father Gregor. 
Of course, but that will take a little time. 
The cemetery workers need to prepare the grave... 
No. You will do it now 
out back. 
My men will dig his grave. 
Sergei Petrovich, this isn't right. 
Then make it right. 
Treat him like a soldier who died on the battlefield and must be buried there. 
Is that how he died? 
In battle? 
You just make it right. 
Say all the prayers. 
Where I end up, I don't care. 
But this boy is with the angels. 
My men will be with you soon. 
Leave us. 
Get up. 
Look at me, Josef. 
I want you to understand that everything I've done, I've done for you and for our family. 
You killed my brother. 
Because I loved him, because I couldn't bear to see him suffer, because there was no other way. 
There's always another way. 
Not when we are dealing with nuclear materials. 
We cannot risk the authorities finding out. 
You know that. 
You don't know why I'm doing this? 
Because when I die, I want to leave you and your family a worthy inheritance. 
Wealth, respect, consequence. 
Can you understand that? 
One day you will. 
As your son grows older, you will. 
And you will understand how much I love you. 
My only son. 
Father Gregor is here to bury Oleg. 
Will you help him? 
He's my brother. 
Thank you. 
Call when you are ready. 
What is it? 
Vladimir Laitanan. 
He says it's important. 
Vladimir, what do you want? 
Sergei Petrovich. 
I apologize for calling you out of the blue like this, sir. 
Uh, your family is well? 
I said, what do you want? 
I have a business proposition. 
Then call me in business time, not in the middle of the night. 
No, no, no, this can't wait. 
I hear there are materials for sale, expensive materials, dangerous ones. 
Talk straight. What materials? 
Nuclear rods. 
Highly enriched uranium. 
So, why are you calling me? 
If anyone has the organization to pull off such a deal, it's you. 
I'm flattered. 
I have a buyer here, a German. 
He's willing to pay a great deal of money for them. 
Double any offer you have. 
Then he is as stupid as you are. 
Are you out of your mind? 
Nobody deals in nuclear rods, nobody. 
I'm sorry. 
A misunderstanding. 
Don't call me again. 
He had no idea what I was talking about. 
All right, then we call the next person. 
You're not listening. 
He says nobody sells these things. 
Nobody. 
You're close to the biggest deal of your life, Vladimir. 
He's just jealous that he's not in on it. 
Come here. Come here. 
Look, later. 
Later. 
Once you've made more calls. 
Come on. 
Okay. Okay, okay, okay. 
We have a problem. 
Vladimir Laitanan knows about the fuel rods. 
What are you going to do? 
Da. 
Anton? 
Yes? 
Mr. President, it's Allison Taylor. 
We were scheduled to resume our discussions. 
I'm late, I know. I apologize. 
The events of this evening... 
The events of this evening make it more important than ever that we complete our work on this treaty. 
Mr. President, I need to know your intentions. 
My intentions? 
The crackdown on your countrymen. 
I've been informed that you've even arrested one of your own delegation. 
That's an internal matter. 
No, sir, it is not. 
Less than an hour ago, I assured delegates from two dozen countries that you were still our best hope for peace. 
I personally guaranteed them you'd observe the letter and spirit of this agreement we are signing. 
And I will. 
Do I have your word on that? 
Madam President, within the next few hours the arrests will stop. 
I'm taking measures to assure that. 
And the delegate you've taken into custody? 
Will be released or charged. 
You have my word. 
Thank you. 
How do you think he sounded? 
Not like himself. 
Did he talk? 
No sir. 
Jamot denies all knowledge of the plot against you. 
How forceful was the interrogation? 
Very. 
I did it myself. 
I don't believe he is involved with your brother in any way. 
You knw Jamot has connections with the extremists. 
A cousin in the opposition party, sir. That's all. 
He he won't talk we have to force the issue. 
He has a wife and children back home, is that correct? 
A boy, 9. A girl, 7. 
Have the Security Services arrest them. 
Apply whatever pressure necessary to make Jamot talk. 
You have something to say? 
Yes, sir. I do. 
You rallied us around you on the promise that you will put an and to such tactics. 
Mr. President, I would do everything humanly possible 
to find your brother, but please... 
do not ask me to violate the principles that you and I both stand for. 
Thank you Tarin. 
With my wife gone, I have no one to speak the truth to me any more. 
Check everyone's computer and phone records again. 
See to it that nothing was overlooked. 
Of course, sir. 
Let's go. 
Nabeel can stay and pack up these files. 
Forget the files. 
Sir? 
Call our security services and have them round up Jamot's wife and children as I asked. 
I don't understand. You just told Tarin that 
I gave you a direct order. 
You obey or not? 
Yes, sir. 
 I will call Security Services. 
 Good. 
And find Tarin's record in that mess. 
He might have his own reasons for not wanting Jamot to talk. 
Nick. 
Nick, come on. We've got to move, man. 
There is gonna be a patrol here any minute. 
Come on. 
 Give me the money. 
 What? 
The money, dumbass. 
We're gonna split this. 
I won't ask you again. 
You can't be serious. 
Bitch. You-- Knock it off. 
Come on man. Let's go. 
Jackass. 
I tolad you we should have gone. 
Such an idiot. 
I just received a call from the hazmat labatory Fort Hamilton. 
They've analyzed the traces of uranium found on Hassan's assassin. 
Did they identify where it came from? 
Sample's too small to be precise, but the uranium is of Soviet origin. 
They're recalibrating their tests now. 
Great. Keep me informed, Chloe. 
Kevin, are you out of there? 
No, not exactly. 
What are you talking about? 
You told me you left there 20 minutes ago. 
Okay, yeah, we didn't. 
Okay, now somebody's here. 
You idiot! 
Yeah, fine, all right, just hurry. 
Somebody's in the hallway. 
I can't believe you let this happen. 
If you get caught, I am dead. 
Hey, we all are. 
All right, so just find us a way out of here. 
Hang on. 
Stay calm. 
It's a cop. 
He's in the hallway right outside the room you're in. 
There's another exit. 
In the corner right behind you. 
Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on! Come on. 
My God, wh... what have you done? 
Damn it! It's locked! 
He's coming inside right now. 
You're going to have to slip past him, go out the door you came in. 
Control, this is ten post 11. I'm at the warehouse... 
Nick! 
What are you doing?! No! 
Kevin, stop him! 
Come on, come on, come on, come on. 
 Come on. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Hey! 
 He called it in. 
We gotta go! 
Come on! 
 Kevin, stop him! 
 Come on. 
We'll call you when we're clear! 
Tarin, are you all right? 
When did you get back from the embassy? 
Just now. 
May I come in? 
What is it? 
It's only me here. 
It's safe. 
What's wrong? 
You know your father has had many people arrested, including Jamot. 
Now he's having Jamot's wife and two children detained back home, so they can be used to force him to talk. 
No. 
There must be some mistake. 
He gave the order himself. 
I thought I'd convinced him not to, but he was lying to me, he went behind my back. 
Kayla, your father is a great man. 
I respect him more than anyone I have ever known. 
But Farhad's betrayal has changed him. 
What can we do? 
Open up, please. 
What are they doing here? 
I don't know. 
Open up. 
Tarin, stay here. 
Yes, Nabeel? 
Miss Kayla, we've been looking everywhere for Tarin. 
Have you seen him? 
No. 
Is there some problem? 
What do you think you're doing? 
We have orders, Miss Kayla. 
I said he wasn't here. 
I'm sorry, but I don't believe you. 
You can't just barge in here! 
I need to talk to my father! 
Nabeel. 
Why do you need armed guards to come looking for me? 
The president says you may be involved with his brother. 
Based on what? 
Nothing. 
Only that I would not allow an innocent family to be tortured. 
He's ordered me to detain you. 
I have no choice. 
You do have a choice, Nabeel. 
Tell my father he's made a mistake, that there's no one more loyal than Tarin. 
Nabeel, this is insane, and you know it. 
Don't make this worse, please. 
Don't you see? My hands are tied. 
Let me talk to my father. 
He's given orders not to be disturbed. 
Even by you. 
I'll talk to him! 
I'll get him to change his mind! 
No, I understand, Roman. 
We'll do business some other time, okay. 
That's it. 
Last one. 
He also knows nothing about nuclear rods. 
He also said it's suicide to deal in them. 
Meier has wasted our time. 
No, look, Meier's intel is good. So we need to think. 
 Who else can we call? 
 No one. 
I've called everyone who could possibly deal in these things. 
Then somebody that you've already talked to has to know something. 
Renee, it's-it's done. 
Look, maybe they don't want to admit it. 
Maybe they don't know how serious you are. 
 You should call them back. 
 I said no. 
Tell them that you have the buyer, tell them you have the money. 
Shut up! 
Just because I like your face doesn't mean I have to put up with your crap. 
We made $5 million. 
A good night's work. 
Why settle for five when we can have 50? 
When did you get so greedy? 
$5 million is plenty. 
Plus we have each other, that's not too bad, is it? 
Oh, it's not bad. 
But it could be better. 
Call them again. 
Do it for me. 
I said no. 
Come on, Vladimir, push them harder. 
 Somebody knows something. 
 What is your problem? 
Nobody knows. There's no one left to call. 
Now you go out there and you tell Meier to leave, okay. 
I'm not telling him anything! 
What? 
Not until you try again. 
Look, it's over! 
 What is wrong with you?! 
 I need this deal. 
That is why you're here? The deal? 
Why else? Do you think that I'm here for you? 
Get up. 
Renee. 
Stop! Stop! 
Stop! 
Oh, God. 
Oh, God. 
Oh, God. 
Oh, God! 
It's all right. It's all right. 
It's over. 
It's over. It's okay. 
Laitanan contacted everyone he thought might have information on the nuclear materials. 
No one responded. 
That's when he said he was finished. 
Renee kept pushing him, and it got ugly. 
Laitanan's dead. 
He attacked her. 
And so, what, you took him out? 
No, she did. 
She did? 
Half an hour earlier, she was having sex with the guy. 
How does that even happen, Jack? 
What, she lose it? 
She was defending herself. 
Look, we knew this guy was violent before we even went in. 
He's violent? 
 He's dead on the floor. 
 Yes, he is. 
And right, now, we still don't have the nuclear materials secured, so I suggest we move on. 
Move on? 
He was our only lead, Jack. 
Now, where do we move on to? 
We can start by working the phone calls that Laitanan made. 
There's also physical files here and a computer to go through. 
Yeah, fine. Cole, 
are you getting this? 
Yes, sir. We're en route from the staging area, five minutes out. 
We're gonna need forensics to rip this place apart. 
Yeah, I got Bennett with me. 
He can coordinate till the full team arrives. 
Just do what you can. 
And bring Laitanan's body back here for autopsy. 
I want to know what the hell happened. 
Any other good news? 
Jack? 
Cole? 
Dana? 
Excuse me? 
I said, anything else? 
No, sir. 
Okay, then. 
 We'll see you when you get here. 
 Yes, sir. 
Our entire operation just went south. 
You think you could show a little interest? 
Pull it together! 
You didn't have to do that. 
Do what? 
Cover for me with Hastings. 
All I did was tell him the truth. 
When they see Vladimir, they'll know what happened. 
What do you think happened? 
It's like you said. 
I couldn't handle it. 
God, I'm sorry. 
It's all right. 
No, it's not. 
I could have killed you. 
I've made such a mess of everything. 
I just thought that if... if I did this, 
I could make it all right. 
I could have my life back. 
Hey. Hey! 
You can have your life back any time you want. 
You just need to want it. 
How? 
I've tried, and I don't know how. 
I don't... 
I don't have anything, anyone. 
You've got me. 
Okay. 
Hey. Hey. 
Look at me. Look at me. 
Okay? 
I didn't want it to end like this. 
I know. 
Look, we're a lot farther ahead than we were three hours ago. 
Every call Laitanan made is a solid lead that we can follow up, and that's because of you. 
You did your part. 
Now let CTU do their job. 
Please? 
Let me take you home. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Damn it, they really must have been moving. 
CTU's here already. 
Listen to me. This is really important. 
Vladimir attacked you, and you defended yourself. 
That's what happened. 
I don't know. 
I do, and if anybody else wants to ask you questions about that, I'll be right there with you to answer them. 
Okay. 
Let me go talk to them. 
They're Russian. 
Vladimir must have contacted whoever's got the rods. 
They just didn't want him to know. 
Hold on to this. 
What are you doing? 
I need to let them take me. 
No. We have to get out of here. 
Listen to me. 
You want everything you've done so far to matter? 
I need to do this. 
When CTU gets here, you tell them to start tracking me from the air. 
These people are gonna lead us to everything we're looking for. 
They will kill you. 
No. At worst, they're going to have to vet me, 
find out how much I know. 
It should buy us enough time. 
Hide in here. 
Take this. 
If this door opens again, you start shooting. 
Don't shoot! 
Please! 
I'm opening the door. 
I'm unarmed. 
See? Both my hands. 
See? No problem. 
I'm unarmed. 
Don't shoot. 
What happened here? 
What happened?! 
They tried to rip me off. 
 But you and I we can do business. 
 Wait! Wait! 
No! Don't shoot! 
If you kill me, you're gonna cost your boss a lot of money. 
Who else is with you here? 
No one. Everybody else is dead. 
All I want to do is business. 
Mikhail! 
Hansen, upload to CTU. 
Mr. Hastings, 
site is secured. Video's coming through. 
Three bodies. Are you getting this? 
Yes, we are. 
Any sign of Jack or Renee? 
No, sir. 
I'm here. 
Here. 
It's Renee, sir. She's alive. 
Renee, where's Jack? 
The Russians took him. 
The ones that have the nuclear materials. 
How? We've been monitoring the building. 
No vehicles left this area. 
I don't... I don't know. 
They just suddenly appeared, but... 
Wait. Jack let himself be taken. 
He said that you'd be monitoring him from the air. 
We haven't seen anything. 
Our drones have been overhead the whole time. 
They saw nothing. 
Where is he? 
Where is he? 
We don't know. 
We don't know. 
Step up. 
I´ll be right back. 
Renee! 
(Jack grunts) Oh, God... 
(gasping breath) You said you had video file implicating people inside the Russian government who were responsible for Renee's murder. 
I want that file. 
Tell me where that file is, now! 
It's in a safety deposit box! 
Where? 
DANA: First Unity Savings. 
I had nothing to do with Renee's death, Jack. 
No. 
You never give up, do you? 
(beep) (loud pop) LOGAN: Bauer may have Walsh, but he can't have the evidence yet. 
We've still got a chance to stop him. 
I'm not the only one who can prove that elements in your government conspired to undermine the peace process. 
So you expect me to kill Bauer for you? 
You have the covert assets here to do the job. 
Maybe I do. 
But I don't have the resources to find him. 
CTU does. 
And the man in charge of the search now reports to me. 
We got him. 
Once they have Bauer, I'll find out where they're holding him. 
You'll have to take him out while he's in custody. 
Freeze! 
Police! 
Do not move. 
(cop grunting) (woman screaming, gunshots) Jack... 
tell me what I can do. 
Nothing. 
(gunshot) (gunshot) (over radio): Mund, this is Captain Walleki. 
I'm on scene. You got 
that guy from the bank yet? 
Just bringing him up, Captain. 
Right. 
It's Cole Ortiz. 
He says he's with CTU. 
WALLEKI: You were with this woman at the bank. 
Do you care to tell me who she is? 
Her name is Dana Walsh. 
Shot twice at close range lot of powder residue around one of the entries, like an execution. 
WALLEKI: Thank you, Mund. 
Get him to CTU, now. 
DANA: The hit on Hassan is all arranged. 
Bazhaev and his people are taking care of everything. 
Well, I'm pleased to hear it, but you could have just as easily called to tell me that. 
DANA: I wanted to know if you've spoken to your superiors... 
told them that I'm out after this goes down. 
I told them what you wanted. 
He feels the same as me: we have too much invested in you to let you walk away. 
You should be focused on getting the E.M.P. device into CTU, 
not on your boyfriend, Ortiz. 
DANA: He's my fiancÃ©, and I told you to leave him out of this. 
I warned you to stay away from him, but you didn't listen. 
And now you think you have feelings for him? 
You think you love him, going to marry him? 
Yes. 
I am. 
And if you have a problem wrapping your brain around that fact, maybe I should talk to your boss in Moscow. 
You talk to no one but me. 
We're done here. 
Don't contact me again until Hassan is dead. 
(phone rings) Yeah? 
Hey, it's me. 
I sent you a DAT video file. 
Okay. I got it. 
It's uploading right now. 
Okay, I need you to get me an I.D. of the man in the video. 
Also, I'm coming in hot, so whatever you have to do to protect your systems from getting flagged, do it now. 
What about the woman? 
You need an I.D. on her? 
She's dead. 
I'll see you in a few minutes. 
All right. 
Jack Bauer's last known location was First Unity Savings Bank on Lexington, where police responded to a 911 call, apparently from Dana Walsh. 
She's dead now. 
Bauer killed her. 
Cole Ortiz, who is known to be aiding and abetting Bauer is being brought here for questioning. 
Now, I need everybody not committed to the U.N. security task 
to devote their full attention to finding him. 
I want all cameras routed through facial recognition and all phone calls monitored. 
You don't have the bandwidth, you steal it from other tasks. 
If you think you have a lead, you bring it to me immediately. 
Any questions? 
Why did they go to the bank? 
Dana said she had evidence of Russian involvement in Hassan's murder. 
Maybe that's where she was stashing it. 
There's no evidence; the president dismissed this. 
Well, she went to the bank with Jack to get something. 
Yeah, what she got was an explosive device that made possible her escape. 
It was her plan all along. 
Look, Jack Bauer can't accept the fact that Dana Walsh was an enemy agent working solely with the I.R.K. opposition 
to Hassan's government. 
His... grief over Renee Walker's 
murder is causing him to create this fantasy about a Russian conspiracy. 
The simple truth is, he's lost it, and he's a danger to himself and the community. 
So let's stop second-guessing the operation, and find him. 
(slaps table) Something is seriously wrong here. 
Pillar's ignoring the key questions, and the questions that he is answering, no one's asking. 
What are you getting at? 
I think Jack's right: this is a cover-up, and Pillar's involved. 
That evidence was at the bank, and Jack has it. 
You don't know that. 
It's all speculation. 
It may be just like Pillar says. 
Until I know otherwise, I got my orders. 
(scoffs) I'm clear. 
Well, you weren't kidding. 
You said you were coming in hot. 
All the police scanners are talking about you. 
They said you shot and killed some woman. 
Construction site on the East Side. 
Was that the same woman in the video you sent me? 
Yeah. Did you I.D. the man? 
No. I'm not going to, either... 
till you tell me what the hell is going on, Jack. 
You saw the video. 
Dana Walsh is a Russian operative. 
She facilitated the assassination of President Hassan and the dirty bomb attack that would have wiped out the entire Upper West Side if we hadn't stopped it. 
I don't want to know about what happened today, and I don't care; I want to know why you're out there on your own and why everybody's after you. 
Because the president tried to lock me down. 
Why? 
Because I know she's trying to cover up the Russian's involvement in today's attack. 
Then why didn't you disappear? 
Because I can't! 
Listen, I want to help you, Jack. 
I really do. 
I need you to be straight with me. 
Tell me exactly what's going on. 
The Russians took something from me. 
Her name was Renee Walker. 
They killed her inside my apartment. 
And I need to make them pay. 
All right. 
Actually, I did I.D. the guy. 
(typing) There he is: Pavel Tokarev. 
Primary operative, Russian intelligence. 
Where is he? 
I don't know exactly. 
He's in the USA. 
Came in a month ago on a diplomatic visa. 
(scoffs) Diplomat. 
I tried to access the Russian database in the embassy. 
He didn't show up in the consulate. 
He could be anywhere, Jack. 
To keep everything quiet, they'd have to be a small unit, right? 
Yeah. 
I think I've got an idea. 
Get me a secure line. 
Meredith. I didn't expect 
you'd still be here. 
Oh, fact check called: there are a few items left on the Hassan piece. 
Abby can follow up on it for you. 
I know. I just... I need 
to make sure it's right. 
I know what he meant to you. 
It shows in this piece you wrote. 
What a great man he was. 
You've done him justice. 
I hope so. 
Miss Reed, there's a call for you on 3. 
Thank you. 
Let me know if there's anything you need. 
Thanks, Gary. 
(sighs) (sets mug down) This is Meredith Reed. 
Miss Reed. 
Who is this? 
My name is Jack Bauer. 
Please don't say anything; just listen. 
The people that you think are responsible for killing President Hassan were not working alone. 
They were being funded and managed by people working inside the Russian government. 
How do you know this? 
I have proof of this: a video file that was made by a Russian agent working out of CTU. 
She made it for her own protection. 
It explains everything that happened in the last 24 hours. 
Have you contacted the authorities about any of this? 
I can't. 
I'm being set up, just like you were yesterday. 
I need to get this evidence to you. 
There's a coffee stand on the third floor of Turner's Department Store. 
Do you think you get there in the next 20 minutes? 
(panting): Miss Reed... 
yesterday I helped clear your name. 
Right now I need you to help clear mine. 
Please. 
(sighs) Of course I'll help you. 
I- I want to know the truth as much as you do. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Take a seat. 
Where's Bauer? 
I don't know. 
You're in some trouble here, Cole. 
I assume you're aware of that. 
Luckily for you, I'm in a position to make all that go away. 
I reviewed your record. 
You've had a exemplary career up to now. 
You're Pillar. 
That's right. 
Jason Pillar. 
I've been asked by the president to oversee the effort to retrieve Jack Bauer. 
Madam President? 
Yes. 
So you're a part of the cover-up? 
Oh, I see here you served in Fallujah. 
I- I spent two tours in command of a marine unit in Baquba myself. 
We're both soldiers. 
So you understand, when the commander-in-chief deems a course of action necessary to the national good, it's not our place to question it. 
The truth is: we're on the same side. 
We both want what's best for our country. 
Bauer doesn't care about that. 
He didn't give a damn about what happened to you, just as long as it served his needs. 
He used you. 
So let's start over. 
Do you know where Jack Bauer is? 
Probably somewhere with the evidence you guys keep saying doesn't exist. 
You really don't want to be playing with me. 
(headset beeps) What? 
Good news: we may have a line on Bauer. 
We intercepted a call. 
Last chance. 
You don't take it, there's nothing anyone can do for you. 
Take him to holding. 
Arlo got a cell phone intercept report off of NSA's Echelon. 
Keywords: Hassan, Russian government, Jack Bauer. 
Did Arlo hear any of the conversation? No, not yet 
 all he's got so far are the data handles, but he's processing the voice matrix now. 
Are we sure it's Bauer? 
No, not yet, but the other side of the call was a phone registered to Meredith Reed. 
She's the reporter CTU arrested last night before the first attempt on Hassan's life. 
Rumor has it she was also his mistress. 
If Bauer was going to reach out to someone with the evidence, she would be an excellent choice. 
Arlo, stop what you're doing. 
Tag and lock the intercept download and send it directly to Eden's system. 
She'll take it from there. 
That's not necessary, sir. 
I said I want Eden to handle it. 
Thanks, Arlo. 
JACK: There's a video file that was made by a Russian agent working out of CTU. 
She made it for her own protection. 
It explains everything that happened in the last 24 hours. 
REED: Have you contacted the authorities about any of this? 
JACK: I can't. I'm being set 
up just like you were yesterday. 
I need to get this evidence to you. 
There's a coffee stand on the third floor of Turner's Department Store. 
Do you think you can get there in the next 20 minutes? 
Jack Bauer. 
PILLAR (over phone): Yes, sir. 
We confirmed the voiceprint. 
So... 
take it to the press that's his next move. 
It appears to be. 
Reed's connection to Hassan means she'd be highly motivated to help him. 
And he hasn't shown her anything yet? 
No, sir. 
Which still means that we, we don't know what the evidence actually is. 
Well, it will be in our hands soon enough. 
This is a major opportunity to make everything go away, sir: Bauer and the evidence. 
I've already dispatched the Russian ops team to the location. 
They'll be in position well before the meet. 
NOVAKOVICH: You need to deal with local law enforcement, make sure Pavel has room to move. 
PILLAR: Yes, we're deploying NYPD away from the site, but we'll still need your guys in and out as quickly as possible. 
Understood. 
Jason, this is, this is a major break you've got, a major break. 
Thank you, sir. 
We'll shut this down. 
I want to stay on top of this personally, Mikhail. 
So will you let me have Pavel's number? 
Can you make this room less public? 
You wanted me for something? 
Yeah, the call you intercepted the one that Pillar hijacked do you think it was from Jack? 
I can't be sure. 
The program hit on keywords Hassan, nuclear, Bauer, but all three have been in the news in the last few hours. 
But the call was to Meredith Reed's cell phone. 
She's a journalist with an interest in the Hassan story. 
Plenty of people could be calling her. 
Doesn't have to be Jack. 
Okay, then explain this. 
Cell intercept report comes in here. 
Two minutes later Pillar downloads the entire conversation into a segregated server surrounded by firewalls like I've never seen. 
Then what does he do? 
Call one, call two, call three. 
Who'd he call? 
I don't know. 
They're outside of CTU and they're all completely masked. 
So the question is this: if the call was nothing, then why are they still hiding it? 
If the call was Jack, then why haven't they dispatched CTU SWAT team? 
Why haven't they alerted NYPD? 
Arlo, they're in on the cover-up. 
Look at them. 
Why? 
Why would they want to do that? 
Because he knows too much. 
He's gotten a hold of Dana's evidence, which proves the Russian involvement in Hassan's assassination. 
They can't let him go public with that. 
That's why I have to find him, and I need your help. 
Okay. 
How do you want to do it? 
I'm gonna talk to Cole. 
He just spent the past two hours with Jack and Dana. 
He must have some idea of what Jack's up to. 
Pillar's got Cole continuously monitored. 
You can't get in there without being seen. 
We'll create a loop and graft it into the security feed. 
That's the other problem: they added an extra layer of oversight to our system. 
Second I try to move beyond my security clearance, I get an on-screen warning. 
They're watching everything we're doing. 
Okay, fine. 
We'll use this, create a mobile hot spot. 
That way we can work off our own net without Pillar breathing down our necks. 
Got it. 
(beeps) Setting up alternate network now. 
We're up. 
Okay, I'm restricting access to you and me. 
How long will it take you to make the loop? 
I can only give you 90 seconds. 
Anything more than that, somebody will notice. 
Okay, text me when you're set up. 
âª âª Fredericks, McDermott was injured in the E.M.P. blast, 
so I need you to collect the night shift time cards and take them to my office. 
Okay. 
Like now? 
Yes, ma'am. 
We put a loop in the security feed. 
I've only got 90 seconds, so I'm gonna get straight to the point. 
I need to find Jack or else they're gonna kill him. 
Who's gonna kill him? 
Pillar and whoever is working with him. 
You need to tell me where he is. 
I got no idea. 
You were at the bank with him; he must have said something. 
Hey, what Jack says and what he does are two very different things. 
He's trying to expose the cover-up. 
He doesn't give a damn about any cover-up. 
He's taking out anyone who was anywhere near Renee's death, starting with Dana. 
She gave him the evidence and he killed her anyway. 
She took the gun out of the safety deposit box. 
She was probably shooting at him. 
He shot her point-blank. 
He executed her, just like she said he would. 
There e no good guys here. 
Jack, Pillar... 
they end up killing each other, maybe it's the best thing. 
No, Jack's my friend. 
If I can find him, I can talk him down. 
These people are just going to kill him. 
I need you to be on my side. 
(scoffs) Everybody wants me on their side. 
Who am I fighting for? 
If we can get to him, we can expose the cover-up. 
You just stay here and feel sorry for yourself. 
I'm gonna go find him. 
Wait. 
Look, it's not much, but Jack's got to be working with someone. 
Who? 
I don't know; I never saw him, but Jack showed up with state-of-the-art weapons and comms, so he's got to have a contact in the city. 
You want to find Jack, you find his supplier. 
Thanks. 
(exhales) (dialing) Arlo. 
You got out in time. 
You okay? 
Yeah, I'm okay. Listen, 
I know what Jack's doing. 
Pull up his files, get me the list of his known associates in the tri-state area, anyone he's worked with in the past. 
Okay. 
In the next half hour, the man who has widely been acknowledged as the vital "third partner" in the peace process Russian President Yuri Suvarov will touch down at JFK. 
He'll be ferried into Manhattan by helicopter and then to the U.N. 
(no audio) (phone vibrates) Yes. 
Pavel, update, please. 
My team is in position. 
Any sign of Bauer? 
Not yet. 
I need to know. 
What about the woman? 
The woman? 
The journalist, her disposition. 
Ms. Reed is aiding and abetting 
a terrorist. 
She's a serious threat to both our countries. 
Do what you have to. 
(phone beeps) I see from Ethan's notes that we still have not completely resolved the issue of site access for the inspection teams. 
I believe it was resolved. 
President Hassan agreed the inspectors would have right of passage over our entire country. 
But he exempted schools. 
Only primary schools. 
Omar didn't think ten-year-old children would be building nuclear missiles. 
Of course. 
I remember now. 
I- I do apologize. 
Are you all right, Madam President? 
It's been a long day. 
I'm fine. 
Thank you. 
Madam President. 
If you'll excuse me for a few minutes, there's someone I need to see. 
Of course. 
Where is he? 
He's in the conference room, ma'am. 
Thank you for seeing me, Madam President. 
I have good news. 
We've located Bauer. 
He-He has the evidence, but... 
Charles, you assured me that that wouldn't happen. 
Please, let me finish. 
We know exactly where Bauer will be and when, and-and we have an operation underway to reacquire him even as we speak. 
Believe me, this is good news. 
(inhales and exhales loudly) Let me know as soon as it's resolved. 
I need to get back to the negotiations. 
Just... There's just 
one thing, Madam President. 
Uh, we are three hours away from the signing of the treaty. 
Isn't it time for my role in the process to be officially recognized? 
I was thinking some kind of, uh, announcement to the media, perhaps by your press secretary, or maybe even by you yourself, Madam President. 
It was, you'll recall, our agreement that I would have a public face on this historic day. 
I believe I've earned it. 
I will talk to my press secretary. 
She will make the announcement in time for the 1:00 o'clock news. 
Thank you very much, Madam President. 
We have contact. 
Target heading to the third floor escalator. 
Acknowledged. 
I see her now. 
We have eyes on Reed. 
Reed is confirmed. 
Units 2 and 3, Reed is approaching you. 
Confirm contact. 
Reed confirmed. 
Approaching the meeting place. 
Any sign of Bauer? 
Where is he? 
He should be here. 
No sign. 
Pavel, do you see Bauer? 
Not yet. 
Unit 1, report. 
We have no visual of Bauer. 
WOMAN: Jason, where are you going? 
There he is. 
He's heading up towards... 
Damn it, I lost him. 
All units, Bauer is on the third floor. 
Do you see him? 
I do not have him. 
What? 
He's there. We see him. 
Get your eyes open, damn it! 
I have not seen him. 
EDEN: Got him. 
PILLAR: Bauer is approaching the target from the southwest. 
He's got a brown leather jacket and jeans. 
EDEN: There he is. 
PILLAR: Pavel, he's in view. 
He's closing in on the cafÃ©. 
You should have a clean line on him. 
Pavel, if you have a shot, take it. 
I've got him. 
Put it down. 
Everything's all clear up at the top, Jack. 
Got her. Come with me. 
Do exactly what I say. Okay. 
All units, target is in the open. Take him out. 
I repeat: take him out. 
You stay down here. You 
don't move. Oh, okay. 
Don't move! 
All right. 
(people screaming) (gunfire) (Meredith gasps) (screaming continues) JACK: Move! 
Okay. 
What the hell just happened? 
He knew it was a trap. 
Don't let them out of your sight. 
We lost him. 
Just keep looking! 
REED: Those people you shot  who were they? 
Russian operatives. 
You have any problems? 
No. 
Let's go. 
(sighs) Jason. Tell me. 
I'm afraid I have bad news, sir. 
All of Pavel's team is dead, and Bauer has Pavel. 
He was ahead of us from the get-go, sir. 
He must have anticipated that we'd use Echelon, and he put out a series of keywords, knowing the listening stations would pick them up. 
He played us, sir. 
He knew we'd use off-book resources to deal with him. 
He used that journalist to draw them out. 
Now, sir, I hardly need to tell you that the situation is grave. 
Pavel knows everything. 
He ran Walsh; he set up the Russian ops. 
If Bauer gets Pavel to talk... 
But at the moment, sir, you still have complete deniability. 
President Taylor made all the decisions. 
I think the time has come for you to distance yourself from this mess. 
It's regrettable, sir, deeply so, but I believe it's what's best for you. 
You... 
20 minutes from now, the president's press secretary is going to make an announcement. 
She will say I have become part of the president's team, and-and I have been indispensable in bringing this peace process to a successful close. 
Sir, may I say that that is a bad idea? 
You need to distance yourself. 
What? You keep using 
that phrase. 
What-What does distance myself mean? 
Do I just slink away? 
This isn't your fault, sir. 
There were circumstances we couldn't have anticipated. 
Namely Bauer. 
Well, then, we find Bauer, and we neutralize him. 
We're public now, Jason. 
We're committed. 
And I have worked... 
We... 
We have worked too hard just to throw this all away. 
Do you understand? 
Yes, of course, sir, but Pavel... 
No. 
Pavel is a good soldier. 
He won't talk, whatever Bauer does to him. 
I, uh... 
I put you at CTU, Jason, for a reason. 
They have huge resources. 
You have intelligence and tenacity. 
You use those capabilities. 
Find Bauer. 
Yes, sir. 
I'll head down to the scene myself. 
Good. 
Keep me posted. 
He wants to move forward. 
Does he understand what actually happened? 
Yes, but he says we still have options. 
(sighs) I need to know you're with me on this. 
(sighs) Yes. Yes, I'm with you. 
Good. I'm heading out. 
I'll clean up the scene, remove all trace of the Russians, and get on Bauer's trail. 
I'll take CTU SWAT with me. 
Tell NYPD to put a two-block perimeter around the store. 
No one goes in or out without my say-so. 
What reason do I give them? 
National security. 
Anyone gives you a hard time, invoke the White House. 
(sighs) Any luck with Jack's associates? 
No. Even discounting 
dead people, and people from foreign countries, it's still going to take hours. 
I think I can narrow it down. 
I just picked up a 911 call from Turner's in Midtown. 
There was a oot-out, people killed. 
I managed to get into the store's security system. 
Oh, my God. 
That's Jack. 
They're trying to kill him. 
Yeah, that part of the plan didn't go so well. 
I tagged the footage 15 minutes before to 15 minutes after the shooting. 
If we run facial recognition on the camera feeds... 
We can match it to the database of Jack's associates, maybe find out who he's working with. 
Thanks, Arlo. 
No problem. 
Copy the camera footage to my screen. 
I'll send you half the personnel files. 
We're clear. Let's go. 
Let's go. 
Where are we going? 
Over here. 
Empty your pockets right now here. 
(Jack mumbles) We'll be safe here for a while. 
(sighs) (zippering) (sighs) RICKER: Jack? We 
don't have much time. 
(panting) Take off your coat. 
Now! 
Those people you killed... 
you were ready for them, weren't you? 
You knew they were coming. 
Yeah. 
So you... 
you knew they'd be listening to our phone call. 
Isn't that right? 
You used me to draw them out, right? 
That's right. 
I could have been killed back there! 
You weren't. 
Now, pick it up. 
I said pick it up! 
REED: What about the evidence you said you'd tell me? 
Was that a lie, too? 
No. 
The evidence is on this memory card. 
When you see it, you'll know it's real. 
Take it. 
My partner's gonna take you somewhere to show it to you. 
I'm sorry things had to play out like this. 
I didn't see another choice. 
REED: What are you gonna do? 
Put your hands behind your back. Now! 
Don't do this, please. You 
don't want to do this. Take her 
to the storeroom. 
No, I'm not going anywhere. 
Please, you cannot do this. 
The evidence I gave you doesn't tell me how Walsh was involved. 
He will. 
Come on. 
No. 
He's a human being! 
You cannot do this this way! 
Sit over there. 
Springfield, M1A rifle. 
.308 round. 
You know, about four hours ago, I had a friend of mine very good friend named Renee Walker was killed by a rifle just like that. 
Go to hell. 
(grunts) (chuckles wryly) You first. 
DANA (on video): The hit on Hassan is all arranged. 
Bazhaev and his people are taking care of everything. 
You talko no one but me. 
We're done here. 
Don't contact me again until Hassan is dead. 
To be honest with you, Renee Walker was more than just my friend. 
But you already know that, don't you? 
Because you saw us in the bedroom of my apartment. 
Now, you're either not very good at what you do... 
or you wanted her to suffer. 
Because with that rifle from that range, it was an easy kill shot. 
But instead, you shot her... 
(quiet grunt) right there... 
two inches below her heart, so she would bleed out slowly. 
I watched her gasping for air... 
as the blood slowly filled her lungs. 
She died in agony, which is exactly what I'm gonna make you do unless you tell me what I want to know. 
(grunting in pain) (yells) (gasping in pain) (Pavel yelling in pain) (yelling) Start talking to me! 
You want to know I killed your girlfriend? 
I killed her. 
I kill your bitch! 
I did it! 
(Jack yells, blows striking) Please... please, 
you've got to stop him. Please. 
He needs answers, and he's gonna get 'em. 
I can use this. 
There's enough here. 
I don't need any more. 
Tell him I don't need any more. Please. 
You're not going anywhere. 
(blows landing in distance) (Jack grunting) (yells) (panting) (indistinct radio transmission) MAN: Let's go. 
Move aside. Move. Move. 
Please step back from the bodies. 
This is now a CTU crime scene. 
I need all weapons and documents you found on these people. 
This is all we got, sir. 
None of them had I.D.s on them. 
This is the man we're looking for. 
His name is Jack Bauer. 
Now, you need to spread out and check every floor and every exit. 
He has a hostage with him, so he won't have gotten far. 
Bauer's armed and extremely dangerous, so if you don't want to end up like these people, shoot on sight. 
Let's go. 
Hey. 
So, why don't we start this again. 
I already know that you killed Renee Walker. 
What I want to know... 
is the name... 
(grunts) of the Russian pig inside your government (grunts) (grunts) ...that gave the order. 
(grunts) Give me a name, and I'll end this quickly. 
I give you my word. 
You think you know about pain? 
You don't know anything yet. 
(screaming) Give me the name of the person inside your government who wanted Renee Walker dead! 
Give me the name! 
(screaming) Who gave the order?! 
Who inside your government wanted Renee Walker dead? 
All you got to do is give me the name! 
(low grunting) (flame whooshing) You are so stupid. 
Renee Walker wasn't a threat to you. 
Her work was finished. 
She was done. We were out. 
All you had to do is leave us alone. 
Now, why couldn't you just leave us alone? 
(screaming) I want the name of the person who gave the order to pull the trigger! 
Who gave the order?! 
Now! 
Did it on my own! 
You're lying. You're nothing. 
You didn't have the authority. 
I want the name! 
Give me the name! 
My name is Pavel Tokarev. 
(clicks on flame) (screaming) (flame stops) (panting) This isn't working. 
Damn it! 
Where's the SIM card for your phone? 
Where's the SIM card?! 
Where'd you drop it? 
You dumb bastard, you swallowed it. 
You swallowed it. 
This is for my friend. 
(gasps) (grunts) âª âª What do you got? 
Fine. There's another 
service hallway. 
Check all the service hallways over there. 
Make sure they're locked down. 
You guys, I want you to go up there, stay on the third floor. 
Do it now. 
(panting) (panting) PILLAR: You've reached the mobile number of President Charles Logan. 
We can't take your call right now, but if you leave a message, we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

Cole, he's dead. 
Just go. Nobody knows you had anything to do with this. 
I don't want you involved. 
I'm already involved. 
We're cleaning this up, and no one's never gonna know what happened. 
They're scum, Dana, and no one's gonna miss 'em. 
Kayla may be in danger. 
She's run away with Tarin. 
She's somewhere in the city with no idea that a nuclear threat exists. 
And, Omar, what about you? 
Don't worry about me. 
Just help me find our daughter. 
Come inside. 
They have the rods you are looking for. 
I thought you had the rods. 
They turned against me. 
I can help you find them. 
Just get me out of here. 
You find Farhad? 
Still looking. 
He won't get far. 
Medic! Come on! Medic! 
I need you to identify the men who stole the nuclear rods from you. 
Can you do that for us? Yes. 
Blood pressure's dropping. We got a rapid heartbeat. 
We lost him. Farhad's dead. 
Damn it! 
Whoever shot Farhad couldn't confirm that he was killed. 
I'm saying that we use Farhad as dead bait. 
Leak it to the press that we've got him in custody, and he survived, and they'll have to make a move on him. 
Tell the support teams it is imperative that we take these terrorists alive. 
Go! Go! 
It's all right. 
We just want to talk to you. 
No. No! 
He's still moving. Notify the perimeter. 
It was a trap. 
Farhad was already dead. 
I locked myself in some kind of oxygen chamber. 
They can't get in here. 
You know what you must do. 
I can't. They scrambled the arming code. 
You need to set it off manually. 
You cannot let them take you alive. 
Can you hear me? 
The following takes place between 2:00 A.M. and 3:00 A.M. 
What's the status? 
The hyperbaric chamber is one-inch steel all around. 
Hermetically sealed, air and power systems are internal. 
Also, its atmosphere is most likely oxygen-enriched. 
Anything we use to blow the door could ignite a fire inside. 
How long will it take to cut in? 
We need to use a low-speed drill to avoid sparks. 
How long? 
Best estimate-- 40 minutes, unless you want us to push the risk. 
I can't take the chance. We need him alive. 
Agent Bauer, the techs have got the internal cameras online. 
We have eyes on him. 
What about the intercom? 
The intercom's still down from when he shorted out the locking mechanism. 
 And the bomb techs say we have a bigger problem.  What? 
They assumed that once we jammed the signal to the detonator, it'd be impossible for the suspect to explode the vest. 
Turns out that may not be the case. 
He's reconfiguring the circuits. 
Yeah. The detonator's 
German military, so our guys are familiar with it. 
The end-around he's sketched out here will work. 
What's the timeframe? 
Well, it depends on how fast he works. 
He needs to reset four circuits. 
That LED light indicates he's already completed one. 
When he wires the other three, he'll be able to explode the device at will. 
The only upside is the chamber will contain the blast. 
No one else will be hurt. 
He's not trying to hurt anybody. 
He's trying to make sure we don't take him alive. 
Get that intercom up and running. 
 I need to talk to him as soon as possible. Yes, Sir. 
This is Bauer. Let me speak to Hastings. 
Right away, sir Mr.Hastings, Jack Bauer on the line. 
So, what have you got, Jack? 
It looks like our suspect might be able to get the detonator working before we can get to him. 
Owen will fill you in on the details. 
Right now, I need to know everything you've got on him. 
I'm just pulling up the information now, Jack. 
It took a while to get it from Hassan's intelligence people. 
Just give me the overview. 
Okay, Marcos Al-Zacar was born here, raised in East Harlem. 
Mother's American, father was from the IRK That's where Al-Zacar got his politics from. 
His father was a professor known to be highly critical of American foreign policies, suspected of connections with extremists. 
He was imprisoned by Wayne Palmer's administration for four months. 
Although the charges were eventually dropped, he was unhireable after that. 
Almost a year later, he committed suicide. 
That must have been what triggered Al-Zacar. 
He started spying on America for the IRK two months after that. 
What about the mother? 
Checking current records. 
According to motor vehicle and utility records she's still in East Harlem. 
4211 East 117th Street. 
Find her and get her here as soon as possible. 
We're on it, Jack. Keep us posted. 
Copy that. 
We have to assume the people building this dirty bomb want to hit a high-value target here in Manhattan. 
But first, they've got to get it on the island. 
 We should shut down the city?  No. 
We want them to make the attempt to move the radiological materials. 
It's our best chance of catching them. 
First, we have to make sure that all of our radiation sensors are strictly monitored at all crossings. 
Arlo, that goes for the drone sensors, too. 
Yes, sir. 
That's all. 
Cole? 
We went over this. 
All we have to do is act natural. 
Keep our heads. 
You'll be okay. 
I am not worried about me. 
You can't really be this calm after what just happened. 
You've never broken a law in your life. 
Cole. 
What do you want me to say? 
I don't know! Anything. Tell me you hate me. 
Tell me that you'll never forgive me for lying to you. 
We're not doing this now. 
 I told you to walk away...  Not now! 
We're in the middle of a radiological threat. 
We got jobs to do. 
When it's over, then we'll talk. 
Look, I can't promise things are going back to the way they were. 
But I wouldn't have done what I did if I didn't still love you. 
You two have holy hell to answer for. 
 Sir, I'm sorry. I can explain...  Save it. 
If you were following up a lead, you should have been updating me every 20 minutes. 
You broke protocol. 
The lead didn't pan out. Witness proved to be unreliable. 
But you're right, sir, there's no excuse. 
I should have called in. 
And you were supposed to be servicing a faulty relay station. 
Yet I see you found time to change your clothes. 
Look. I don't know what's going on with you two 
and, frankly, I don't care. 
If we weren't at high alert, and you weren't the best at what you do, you'd both be out on your asses for this. 
I'm going to ask you once. 
Whatever it is, are you finished? 
 Yes, sir.   Good. 
Walsh, until further notice, you will answer to Chloe O'Brian. 
She will fill you in on what she needs from you. 
Bauer has a situation at St. Julian's Hospital. 
I need you to assemble a team, pick up an Elaine Al-Zacar from East 117th and take her to him. 
 Is she a hostile?   Unclear. 
Arlo will fill you in on the details. 
 Yes, sir.   How you perform 
from this point will determine whether or not you salvage your careers. 
Now, get to work. 
Yes? 
I'm in place. 
I've managed to tap into the hospital's security cameras. 
But we can only pick up audio in the hallway outside the room. 
CTU has set up a command center there. 
Can you see Marcos? 
Yes. He's still working on the detonator. 
Are you able to gauge his progress? 
He already has one of the four circuits reconfigured. 
We're arriving at the landing now. 
Soon we'll be able to transport the rods into Manhattan. 
Are CTU's radiation sensors down? 
Not yet. But we'll be ready. 
Call me when Marcos is dead. 
Port Authority's reporting no hits on the radiation sensors at the Holland, Midtown and Lincoln Tunnels. 
I don't see any stream updates for the GW, Brooklyn or Queens crossings. 
What the problem? 
MTA's providing that feed on a dedicated sublink to prevent a server overload. 
You can access it yourself on the system's Ethernet port. 
So there's really no problem. 
There's no way I could have known that since you didn't put that in your hourlies. 
Right. I will do that next time. 
I know this must be hard for you, having to report to me since you've been demoted. 
It's okay, Chloe, I deserved it. 
Yeah, you did. 
I just want you to know I'm actually glad you didn't get fired or anything and... 
Hang in there. 
Thank you. I appreciate that. 
Where are we on aerial detection? 
I've got drones covering every inch of the waterfront with their radiation detectors cranked up. 
If they try to bring the fuel rods into the city by boat, we'll spot them. 
Easily. 
Look, I know you probably hate my guts right now, but I just wanted you to know that I'm sorry. 
For telling Cole about you and that other guy. 
I mean, you were definitely messing up, and with the threat of those rods out there... 
Don't worry about it, Arlo. 
So is he gone? 
Who? 
You know. 
The other guy. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, he's gone. 
So, you and the Boy Scout are okay? 
We'll get through it. 
I'm glad. 
But if for some reason  that changes...   I know. 
Meaning, if you ever decide you want to trade up... 
I got it. 
Sir, we got the intercom to the chamber working. 
You should be able to talk to the suspect. 
Good. Tell CTU I'll keep my comm up 
So they can monitor. 
Yes, sir. 
Marcos, my name is Jack Bauer. 
I'm working with CTU. 
I know the original plan was to smuggle the fuel rods back to the IRK to reconstitute their nuclear program. 
So I'm just guessing that helping to deliver a dirty bomb to New York City which will cost the lives of tens of thousands of innocent people isn't exactly what you signed on for. 
But the truth is if you do this, you'll be killing the IRK. 
By bombing New York City, you're going to force President Taylor to retaliate, and she will, hard. 
You can't possibly want that. 
It doesn't matter what I want. 
This so-called peace agreement, it's just Hassan signing away my country's ability to defend itself, its independence. 
He's surrendering without a fight. 
But there are a lot of people in his own government who are not willing to do that. 
Marcos, you can't win this fight. 
The IRK will sustain massive casualties because of this. 
Because of you. 
Not because of me. 
America will be the one dropping all the bombs. 
No, son. 
The eyes of the world will hold you responsible for the innocent lives taken in New York City. 
No, don't think you can take the moral high ground with me. 
The arrogance of this country. 
That it feels it can dictate to the rest of the world who gets... who gets to have nuclear weapons, 
while it insists on keeping my people in the Dark Ages. 
You keep saying "Your people, your country." 
Marcos, I read your file. 
You were born here. You're an American citizen. 
Your father is from the IRK. 
You leave my father out of this! 
What happened to your father was unfair and tragic, but this is no way to honor his memory. 
Please, you can still do the right thing here. 
You can help me stop this from happening. 
All you have to do is open the door. 
Please, I'm begging you. 
You're not going to get me to change my mind. 
I came here prepared to die. 
And that's what's going to happen. 
Marcos. 
Marcos. 
Please, just talk to me. 
Marcos! 
Marcos! 
Yes, of course. I understand. 
We'll see you soon. 
Thank you. 
Your friend at the State Department you trust he can do what he says, give us asylum? 
Yes. 
He says with what your father has been doing ordering unlawful arrest and torture U.S. Law will consider us political refugees. 
But you have to understand, asylum will not be granted overnight. 
Well, how long are we talking about? 
A year, maybe 18 months. 
But as soon as we file the application, we are protected by the law. 
Your father cannot touch us. 
You know that I will not be able to work here legally until asylum has been granted. 
I have some savings. 
But I will not be able to give you the life that you have been used to. 
Oh, you know I don't care about any of that. 
One minute. 
Oh... my mother again. 
 I really should answer it.   Kayla. 
No, she deserves to know I'm all right. 
Give that back to me! 
 Please.   You know what? You can call her 
when the lawyer has filed the application. 
We must wait until then. 
Bye-bye. 
Kayla, it's me again. 
Darling, I need to talk to you. 
Your father told me something terrible may be happening here in New York. 
Please, call me back as soon as you get this message. 
I still can't reach her. 
Thank you for coming back. 
Our daughter is missing. 
I'm not leaving until I know she's all right. 
We'll find her, Dalia. 
Nabeel told me you had Tarin arrested. 
I didn't know who I could trust. 
So you started arresting people from inside your own delegation? 
What possible evidence could you have gathered so quickly? 
 I had to do something.  But Tarin? 
He's one of your most loyal men. 
So was my brother. 
Or so I thought. 
Until he tried to have me killed and destroy my government. 
If you continue to act the way you have been, you will have done the job for him. 
Have you told the police? 
I've been trying to deal with it on my own. 
But it's time to get them involved. 
Dalia, I'm sorry. 
As you should be! 
This city is under attack! 
Our daughter is god knows where! 
You drove her away with your suspicion and your paranoia! 
How could you, Omar? 
How could you have lost your way? 
Dalia. 
You're right. 
I have. 
I have. I see that now. 
And I'll make changes. 
I'll do everything in my power to find her. 
And get her safe. 
You have my word. 
I am sorry. 
Dalia, I'm sorry. 
Who is it? 
Elaine Al-Zacar? 
What do you want? 
My name is Cole Ortiz. 
I'm an agent with CTU. 
I need you to open that door, ma'am. 
I don't understand. What's this about? 
Your son, Marcos. 
Marcos? 
Ma'am, you're either going to open that door or I'm gonna break it down. Now! 
Go! 
Put your hands in the air, now. 
Mrs. Al-Zacar, are you aware of where your son is right now? 
 Not at the moment.  How much do you know 
about his activities on behalf of the IRK? 
I know that he communicates with family there, if that's what you mean. 
You going somewhere? 
I was just about to leave to my sister's house. 
You do that a lot, take trips to visit relatives at 2:30 in the morning? 
No, I don't. I can explain. 
Marcos called me about an hour ago. 
He told me to leave the city. 
He said he needed me to meet him at my sister's house in Pennsylvania. 
 He didn't tell you anything else?  No. 
I swear. 
Ma'am, right now your son's barricaded himself at St. Julian's Hospital, 
trying to blow himself up with a suicide vest. 
Oh, my God. No! 
I need you to come with me to St. Julian's-- ma'am. 
We don't know how much longer we have till your son can activate the explosives. we have to go. 
Yes? 
Sir, Cole just checked in. 
He's got Al-Zacar's mother and he's en route  to St. Julian's now. What's his ETA? 
Less than ten minutes. 
All right, then. Thank you. 
Sir, I would like to apologize again for leaving my post. I know that I let you down. 
Yes, you did. 
I brought you in and gave you this promotion because I saw something in you, not just your skill, which is considerable. 
But an ability to adapt to any situation, drive to be better, attributes that make you a good leader. 
Or did I misread that? 
No, sir. 
So we can chalk up the last several hours to a serious lapse in judgment? 
 What I was...  Look. 
I don't want to lose you or Cole. 
You're both valuable, but everyone is replaceable. 
I screwed up and I'm willing to accept the consequences. 
I know that Cole feels the same way. 
Thank you, sir. 
Hello? 
Can I ask who I'm speaking with? 
Excuse me? 
Would you mind telling me your name, please? 
This is Dana Walsh. Who is this? 
Forgive me, Miss Walsh, for calling at this ungodly hour. 
I actually expected to leave a message. 
I'm sorry if I woke you. 
No, no, that's okay. I'm actually at work. 
What is this regarding? 
Well, my name's Prady. I'm with the Department of Corrections 
down in Little Rock. 
I'm trying to locate an individual by the name of Kevin Wade. 
I-I'm sorry. 
Who did you say that you were again? 
Bill Prady. I'm a probation officer. 
Mr. Wade is one of my charges. 
Do you know him? 
No, no. I don't think that I do. 
Well, that's peculiar since he dialed this number a few days ago from a motel room in Queens. 
Probably just a misdial. 
No. Dialed this number more than once, 
and some of the calls lasted more than a couple of minutes. 
Look, Mr. Prady, I am really busy right now. 
I work for CTU and we are in the middle of a crisis. 
Well, I completely understand. I've heard the news. 
But since we're both awake, I wonder if I could meet with you in person. 
You mean now? 
Well, I got an early flight to Little Rock in the morning, so, yeah, it'd pretty much have to be now, ma'am. 
I'm sorry. I-I don't really understand 
why this is so pressing. 
Well, Miss Walsh, I've grown kind of fond of young Kevin, and the longer it takes me to find him, the harder it'll be for me to keep him from going back into prison. 
I don't really see how I can be of any help. 
Yeah, well, maybe not. 
But we can determine that when we speak. 
Like I said, it won't take long. 
Look, if it'll smooth things over, I could call your supervisor. 
No, no. That won't be necessary. 
I'm sure that I could spare a few minutes for you. 
Thank you, ma'am. That would be super. 
Tell you what. Let me just pull over, 
and I'll get your address. All right? 
Of course. 
Sir, according to the bomb techs, he's close. 
Getting that third circuit active was the toughest part. 
The fourth is only a matter of rerouting the firing circuits. 
What's the time frame? 
Ten minutes, maybe less. 
How much longer is it going to take them to drill through? 
Too long. They're not going to make it. 
Get her some water. 
Take care of that. 
Did she resist? 
Not once I told her her boy had explosives strapped to him and was going to blow himself up. 
She had a packed suitcase, Jack. 
So he cares enough about her to make sure she got out of town. 
What else does she know? 
Nothing, as far as I can tell. 
And I didn't tell her anything more. 
Okay, good. 
Mrs. Al-Zacar, my name is Jack Bauer. 
I'm in charge of field operations here. 
 Where is he?  I'm going to take you to him. 
 I want to see him.  I'm going to take you to him. 
Please sit down. I need you to fully understand the situation. 
Please. 
This is Ortiz. 
Cole, it's me. 
Kevin's probation officer just called me. 
He's in New York, trying to track down Kevin. 
I can't talk to you about this now. 
We're in the middle here. 
Listen to me. I told him I didn't know who Kevin was, 
but... he caught me in the lie. 
He has records that show him calling my cell several times. 
Cole, this probation officer is on his way here. 
Look, you're going to have to figure out a reason why he had your number. 
I don't know if I can do this. 
What, lie? 
Come on, we both know you're good at it. 
Sorry. 
Look, you just have to handle  this. Okay? 
All right? 
Yeah. 
Let me know what happens. 
I got to go. 
I can't believe this is happening. 
You need to believe it. 
The men your son is working with intend on detonating a radiological bomb somewhere in Manhattan. 
That's why your son tried to get you out of the city. 
Marcos has been an agent for the IRK, spying on this country since your husband died. 
We have proof of that. 
And now he's going to kill himself in order to protect this plot unless you can convince him otherwise. 
What do-what do I say to him? 
Whatever you have to, to get him to stop rearming that vest, and open the door. 
We need him to open the door. 
Do you understand? 
If he does that, then what happens to him? 
He'll be alive. 
If he cooperates with us, I promise you, I will do everything I can to help him. 
I give you my word. 
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but we need to do this now. 
We need the room. 
Now. 
It's definitely her. 
Marcos's mother. 
You recruited him, Ali. 
You know him better than anyone. 
Will she be able to talk him down? 
He's loyal to our country. 
I don't think so. 
Marcos? 
Marcos, it's me. 
Mom, what are you doing here? 
Marcos, you have to stop this. 
This is crazy. 
You son of a bitch! 
Leave us alone! 
You leave us alone! 
Marcos, talk to me. 
Oh, my God, Mom. 
I told you to get out of the city. 
I told you to go to Aunt Shelley's. 
Why didn't you listen to me? 
I'm listening now. 
You told me that you were going to meet me there. 
I believed you. 
I was trying to protect you. 
From a terrorist attack? 
That's what they say that you're involved in here. 
Something that's going to kill many, many people. 
Marcos, tell me that's not true! 
Tell me! 
Marcos, why? 
You ask me that? 
After what this country did to Dad? 
Marcos, I loved your father. You know I did. 
But he was a complicated man, and especially when it came to his politics. 
But he never condoned violence of any kind, Marcos. 
Never. 
He would agree with what we're doing. 
You really think that? 
He hated America. 
And yet he came to America. 
He married an American. 
He had an American son. 
Honey, nothing is as simple as you're making it out to be. 
Mr. Hastings. 
I've registered a 12% degradation in the hospital's security feed. 
Can you boost the signal? 
You're missing the point. 
The indications are someone's tapped into the feed. 
They can see everything we can. 
I'll see if I can trace it. 
I wish I'd done more. 
I wish I'd helped you deal with your grief and with your anger. 
No, don't put this on yourself. 
You couldn't have done any more or been a better mother. 
She's almost got him. 
Jack, do you copy? 
Yeah, Chloe. Go ahead. 
The video feed has been compromised. 
You're being surveilled. 
Copy that. I'll take care of it from here. 
Owen, how long will it take to disconnect the video system? 
30 seconds. 
 Get on it.  What's going on, Jack? 
Someone else is watching. 
Mom... 
I know what they want you to do. 
But it's too late for that. 
Don't say that. 
You can still turn yourself in. 
We'll hire the best lawyers, whatever it takes. 
I'll be with you every step of the way. 
I promise that. 
I'm sorry. 
Marcos, I'm-I'm begging you. 
Mom, listen to me. 
You got to be strong now. 
Damn it. No. 
Marcos, please. You're all I have. 
Please don't do this. 
I love you so much. 
 I'm sorry.  It's over. Get her out of there. 
 I'm sorry.  Now! Move! 
Marcos, No! No! 
No! Marcos, no! 
No! No! 
Samir, I just lost picture. 
Is his mother still in the room? 
No, but he's still in there with one of the agents. 
You detonate that vest, your mother dies, too. 
What did you say? 
You heard me. 
I'm going to make sure your mother's in Manhattan when that dirty bomb goes off. 
You don't even know what the target is. 
I'm not talking about her dying during the explosion. 
I'm going to personally escort her to the blast site, so she's exposed to the radiation. 
I don't believe you. 
You wouldn't do that. You're a federal agent. 
Truth is, I'm not, really. 
Well, not anymore. 
I'm more of a specialist that they brought in for today. 
If you knew who I was, and things I've done before in my life, you would know that I'm not bluffing. 
So, go ahead. 
Blow yourself up into a million pieces. 
First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to make your mother come in here and clean it up. 
And then I'm going to take her to the blast site. 
Do you know how long it takes a human body to absorb a lethal dose of cesium 137? 
Five seconds. 
Followed by 12 days of pain that's so agonizing, morphine can't even touch it. 
You got a decision to make. 
Make it carefully. 
You're not gonna hurt my mother. 
I am done playing with you. 
You look into my eyes. 
Look in my eyes! 
You think I'm joking. 
What happens to your mother is because of you. 
Only you. 
If I open the door and I come out, you promise you won't hurt her? 
You promise you'll leave her alone? 
I give you my word. 
Cole, I've got some action on the door. 
Put your hands up now! 
Walk towards me! 
Move! 
Down on your knees! 
Put your hands behind your head and interlock your fingers! 
Don't you move! 
Cole, I got four lights on. 
Damn it! 
Cole, I got four lights on! 
We need bomb techs now. 
The suspect's come out of the chamber, but he's managed to arm the vest. 
I repeat, he has armed the vest. 
We need bomb techs here to disable it now! 
Samir, Marcos is out of the chamber. 
 What?!  They must have talked him out of it, 
but he's rearmed the vest. 
You're sure? He's still wearing it? 
Yes, I think so. 
Hang up right now and transmit the fail-safe. 
Let's move! 
Keep you men back! I know the circuit pattern! 
I'm looking for four common leads before I can disarm it. 
What's happening?! What is that?! 
Cole, they must have triggerd a fail-safe. 
Get you men back now. 
Move! Move! Move! 
Get this off of me! 
I'm gonna try! Just stay calm! 
Mom! 
Get her out of here now! 
Marcos, I might not be able to do this in time. 
I need to know what the target is. 
I don't know. 
How are they gonna smuggle the fuel rods into the city past the radiological detectors? 
I don't know, I swear! 
Who does?! 
Give me a name. 
Damn it, Marcos, give me a name! 
President Hassan's head of security Tarin Faroush! 
Tarin Faroush. Did you get that, Cole? 
Copy! Come on. 
Come on. Come on. 
One more. 
I'm not gonna be able to do this in time. 
You tell my mother I'm sorry. 
Jack? Jack, do you copy? 
CTU, this is Jack. 
Marcos is dead. 
I'm gonna need to speak to President Hassan. 
Commissioner, I appreciate that your NYPD's overburdened, but I would ask you to do whatever you can to have my daughter's picture circulated. 
Please keep me posted if you get any information regarding her whereabouts. 
Yes. 
Thank you. 
Sir, CTU is routing a call to you. 
From whom? 
Jack Bauer. 
Yes, Mr. Bauer? This is President Hassan. 
Mr. President, I was told you were briefed 
on the situation at St. Julian's Hospital. 
I was. 
Sir, the suicide bomber is dead. 
His explosive vest was remotely detonated. 
Then you have no leads. 
No, sir, we actually do. 
Before the suspect was killed, he identified your head of security, Tarin Faroush, as a co-conspirator. 
Tarin? 
Are you sure about this? 
Yes, sir. Right now you need to call UN security 
and have them take Mr. Faroush into custody until we get there. 
That won't be possible, Mr. Bauer. 
Tarin's not here. 
Where is he? 
I don't know. Somewhere with my daughter. 
Excuse me? 
They are in love... 
so I've learned. 
Mr. Bauer, I suspected Tarin hours ago, 
and had him arrested for questioning. 
He escaped while being transported to our embassy. 
Kayla believed he was innocent, and has, apparently, run away with him. 
Do you have any idea where they might be? 
 None.  Can you contact your daughter? 
My wife has made several attempts, but she isn't answering her phone. 
Sir, you need to keep trying. 
Right now Mr. Faroush is our only lead. 
I'm going to jump in the shower. 
Hello, Mother. 
Kayla? 
I have her. 
 Mr. Bauer,  Darling, are you all right? 
we have Kayla on line with her mother. 
Oh, I'm fine, Mother. 
Mr.President, you need to get me an address. 
I'm sorry I've been ignoring your calls, but I know Father has put you up to this. 
 Where are you?  You know I can't tell you that. 
Is Tarin with you? 
Not at the moment, no. 
He doesn't want me to speak to anyone. 
Kayla, listen to me, you are in danger. 
Tarin is working with your father's enemies. 
That's not true. 
It's Father's paranoid delusions. 
It isn't. 
CTU just called to confirm. 
They're on the line with your father now. 
I don't believe you. 
Kayla, please. 
You know I loathed your father's behavior and the way that he's handled everything. 
I wouldn't be telling you this unless I believed it, too. 
Not Tarin. 
It has to be a mistake. 
Then we'll sort it out together. 
But you must tell me where you are. 
Kayla! 
The Teodore Hotel, suite 514. 
The Teodore, suite 514. 
 Mr. Bauer.  Kayla, darling, just stay where you are. 
The police will be there shortly. 
They are at the Teodore Hotel, suite 514. 
Thank you, sir. 
I promise I'll call you once the Americans give us asylum. 
Please don't tell Father we spoke. 
 Kayla?  I love you, too.  Hello? 
I thought we agreed you weren't gonna take your mother's call. 
I'm sorry, my love. I just didn't want her to worry. 
Did you tell her where we are? 
Did you? 
Of course not. 
Do you think I'm stupid? 
You know I could never think such a thing. 
You are perfection. 
Now come on. We must get dressed. 
Where are we going? 
Where do you think? 
To formally request our asylum. 
At this hour? 
My friend at the State Department made the arrangements. 
But I'm exhausted. 
We haven't even slept. 
I suppose you blame me for that, huh? 
Well, then... can't we have 
a little more time together? 
No. Come on. 
You must get dressed. 
Why don't you just get dressed here? 
I'm just gonna clean up first. 
He's in the Teodore Hotel, suite 514. 
And Kayla's... Kayla's with him. 
Our men are clearing out now. It's all yours. 
Where are we? 
I could have a Tac team at the Teodore in 20 minutes. 
No, NYPD can get there faster. 
I want your men to set up a perimeter and wait until we get there. 
If any of your men happen to come in contact with the suspect, it is imperative that they know we need to take him alive. Let's go. 
Renee! 
Vladimir attacked you and you defended yourself. 
That's what happened. 
 I don't know. 
 I do and if anybody else ants to ask you questions about that, I'll be right there with you to answer them. 
You were implying something about Dana, and I want to know what it is. 
I think she went to meet some guy. 
Take a look at this. 
You think you can find her? 
You promise me I do this one thing for you, and then you'll leave me alone. 
That's not gonna happen. 
This is a sweet operation that we got going here. 
You know? You getting the access codes, 
and us pulling the jobs. 
You can't do this to me, Kevin. 
You know who I am? 
All I know is that there's a very powerful man in the Russian Syndicate who's been trafficking weapons-grade uranium. 
Who do you work for? 
I'm not at liberty to say. 
Dmitri, work on him, until he's ready to tell us everything. 
It's over, you know that, right? 
You want to know where the rods are? 
I will tell you. 
But I want full immunity. 
Amanda, are you seeing this? 
Where the hell are the rods? 
We've picked up trace radiation signatures. 
The rods were here. 
I told you, they were there. 
I had two of my men guarding them. 
We found their bodies; both shot. 
Josef. 
I wasn't sure I believed Josef that you would betray your father. 
You were upset that he was holding up delivery of the rods. 
Now I've gotten them for you. 
When will you get here? 
Less than five minutes. 
Just have my money ready. 
CTU. O'Brian. 
Chloe, it's Jack. Do you have Hastings there? 
Yes. 
 Are you ready to trace the call? 
 We're ready. 
As soon as Bazhaev gets his son on the phone, we can begin to triangulate. 
Okay, hold on. 
Farhad, where are you? You're late. 
Josef, it's me, your father. 
Don't hang up. Stay on the line. 
Please. 
I know you have the rods. 
Yes. 
I wanted you to know. 
The police know, too. They're here. 
You told the police? 
Of course not. 
It was Vladimir's buyer-- he's a Federal agent. 
Josef, just so we're up front, I'm here with your father. 
My name is Jack Bauer; I work with CTU. 
Well, do what you want with him; I don't care. 
Maybe you don't-- but your father cares about you. 
He negotiated immunity for you. 
All you need to do is bring the fuel rods in, and you can put the rest of this behind you. 
It's the only way you'll be safe. 
Safe? Did my father tell you about my other brother? 
What he did to him? 
Oleg was dying; you know that. 
Yeah, we could have saved him. 
He would be alive if not for your precious deal. 
You are right, maybe you are right, I don't know, but... 
that doesn't bring Oleg back, and I cannot bear to lose another son. 
Don't worry about me. 
 I'll be fine. 
 No, you won't be. 
You won't be anything. 
It's over. 
Federal agents are here going through everything. 
The entire city is under guard. 
If you don't bring the rods in, they will hunt you down. 
They will kill you, Josef. 
I won't be able to protect you. 
I don't want to see you hurt. 
If I hand over the rods, how does this work? 
Tell us where you are, and we'll bring you in. 
Oh, just like that? 
After everything we've done? 
Yes, I told you-- they have given us immunity. 
Please, Josef, please. 
This is your last chance. 
Are you there? 
Yes, I'm here. 
You need to bring him in now, before Farhad gets there. 
Josef, did you hear that? 
You need to move. 
Josef? 
All right, I'm on my way. 
I'll call you from the road to let you know where to meet me. 
Careful with the rods. 
Sounded like shots fired. 
You need to help him! 
Where is he?! 
I don't know. 
Chloe, did you get a trace on that call? 
Not exactly, but it looks like he was in central Queens near Flushing Meadow Park. 
I want units combing that area. 
Jack, bring your suspect back to CTU. 
Copy that. Get him ready for transport now. 
 Is he dead? 
 Yes. 
We need to hurry. 
The boat is waiting for us at the port. 
The port may not be the right thing. 
What do you mean? 
The authorities know our plan. 
We need a new one. 
Hey. 
Did you get that? 
Yes, Jack. We're trying to get an ID off the voice print. 
So far, no luck locking down a location. 
Copy that. We're on our way back now. 
We need to hurry. Take the van and get the rods... 
We've got a match for the voice at the end of the call-- Farhad Hassan. 
So, he got his fuel rods. 
Any ID on the other man we heard? 
No, sir. 
Mr. Hastings, Rob Weiss for you. 
Tell him I'll be right with him. 
Give me an ETA on Bazhaev. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Start the interrogation as soon as he gets here. 
Yeah? 
Jack, it's Chloe. Hastings wants your ETA. 
He's anxious to interrogate Bazhaev. 
I'm about 15 minutes out. 
But I wouldn't count on getting anything from him. 
If Bazhaev could have told me how to get to the people that just killed his son, he would have. 
Jack, I heard about what you went through. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks. 
How's Renee? 
Pretty worried about you. 
They've still got her in medical. 
Yeah. Could you patch me through to her? 
Hold on. 
Okay. 
Hey. 
Renee, I have Jack. 
Jack. 
How are you? 
Uh, fine, I'm fine. What about you? 
We had a line on the fuel rods. 
We lost it. 
So what's the plan now? 
It's Hastings' call. 
I'm bringing the prisoner back to CTU, then I'm out. 
They ask you about what happened, about Vladimir? 
Uh, yes, Chloe did. 
Chloe did the debrief? 
Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't... 
I wouldn't really call it a debrief. 
We talked, uh, mostly, and, uh, then I wrote a statement. 
And you explained how you acted in self-defense? 
Yes, like we agreed. 
That's how it happened. 
Renee, you've got to stick with that. 
Yeah, yes, I'm gonna try. 
I know this is hard for you, but you did nothing wrong, and you need to start believing that. 
Okay? 
Okay. 
Jack, I don't... I don't know how to say this, 
so I'm just gonna say it, 'cause I need to make sure that I'm not misunderstanding, but... 
when you say that I "have you"... 
I meant it like it sounded. 
So now what do we do? 
We'll figure it out. 
Okay. 
I'll be in in about 15 minutes. 
Bye. 
 Rob, it's Brian. 
 I just got a flash from your office how this immunity situation the president authorized played out. 
It's not good, Brian. 
Really not. 
Now, as I understand it, Bazhaev's son swiped the rods from his father before we got there. 
That's correct. 
 And now the son is dead. 
 Yes. 
Do we know who has the rods now? 
Apparently, it's Farhad Hassan. 
And where is he? 
 We're looking. 
 Meaning you have no idea. 
Brian, I pushed the president to resurrect CTU with you at the helm. 
Now, you tell me you can do the job, I believe you. 
I can do the job. 
Good to hear it. 
'Cause when things get this colossally screwed up, people look for someone to blame. 
So what are you saying? 
I'm saying I don't want that person to be you. 
I put you there; you're my guy. 
If you fail, I fail. 
And that cannot happen. 
Are we on the same page here? 
So what have you got in mind? 
Renee Walker. 
She killed one of our main leads, isn't that correct? 
He was a psychopath-- she was defending herself. 
She stabbed him 15 times. 
What, are you saying it was murder? 
I'm saying that's for lawyers to decide. 
We're talking about a woman who put her life on the line when she didn't have to. 
I'm sure that will weigh in her favor. 
You know what a conviction would mean she'd go away for years. 
Well, someone has to pay for this, Brian. 
So you tell me-- who do you want that to be? 
I'm sending someone over from Justice. 
A Kristin Smith. 
She'll take care of everything. 
What do you need from me? 
Just open the door and get out of the way. 
We did a sweep, sir. 
No trace of any hazardous materials. 
 Fine. Finish up, get back to base. 
 Yes, sir. 
Arlo? 
Yeah. 
 Find Dana yet? 
 I think so. 
I'm tracking the GPS coordinates off her phone. 
All right, send them to my PDA. 
Are you sure that's a good idea? I mean, there could be 
a reasonable explanation why she's... 
Hey, you're the one who stuck his nose in all this. 
Just do it. 
Okay. 
Coordinates are on your phone. 
Thanks. 
Look, I'm sending everyone back to CTU. 
What are you going to do? 
I'll be there within the hour. 
If Hastings asks, just tell him I'm following up a lead. 
Look, I know Dana means a lot to you, but do you really think this is worth going AWOL over? 
She's my fiance�, Arlo. 
Jim, I'm taking your vehicle. 
Find Owen, have him take SWAT back to CTU. 
Say I'll be right behind them. 
No problem, sir. 
Is Dana back yet? 
I don't think so, sir. 
Do you need her for something? 
Do I need her for something? 
Yes, Arlo, she's my chief data analyst. 
I need her to do her job. 
You track her down, and you let me know when you find her. 
Mr. Hastings, Kristin Smith from the Justice Department 
 is here to see you. 
 Thank you. 
Ms. Smith. 
Mr. Hastings. 
 Did Rob Weiss brief you? 
 He did. 
I have to interview a Renee Walker. 
I read her statement on the way over. 
Did it appear to you that she's guilty of murder? 
Mr. Weiss warned me you might have issues with this. 
With hanging a brave woman out to dry? 
Yes, I do. 
There are major discrepancies between her statement and the forensic evidence. 
All I'm asking her to do is to set the record straight. 
I feel it would be prudent to restrict surveillance access to this interview. 
Fine. 
But I would also like a video record of it in the event of legal proceedings. 
Can I ask you to provide that? 
Yes. Right this way, please. 
This is a transcript of your statement. 
You should review it before you sign it. 
How far out did Jack say he was? 
15 minutes. 
This is Kristin Smith from Justice. 
She needs to talk to Renee, so if you'll excuse us, Chloe. 
Talk to her about what? 
Now, Chloe. 
Thank you, Mr. Hastings. 
What is she talking to her about? 
She was about to sign her statement. 
I already debriefed her. 
Kristin just needs to fill in a few details. 
I already filled in the details. 
I know that you are protective of Renee. 
 I respect that. 
 Than let me sit in on the interview. 
Why? 
Was your debrief not a full and honest statement of the facts? 
We have nuclear materials in the hands of terrorists. 
Now, I need you back at your desk focused on that. 
Yes, sir. 
What is this place? 
A staging area. 
It belongs to a businessman who supports our cause. 
I don't want to delay too long. 
We need to find another way to get the nuclear rods out of the country. 
You heard what the American said to Bazhaev's son. 
They already know what we're trying to do. 
Which is why we need to move quickly. 
The Americans are not stupid, Farhad. 
If we go near any airfield or harbor now, the radiological detectors will spot us. 
Who are these men, Samir? 
These are men I have recruited. Our men. 
What are they doing here? 
They're going to unload the rods. 
We need to get rid of the van. 
And then what? 
You should rest. 
I don't need to rest. 
I need to know what we're doing. 
We can't get the rods out of the country. 
So let's use them. 
Use them? How? 
As a weapon. 
A radiological bomb. 
We'll show the Americans how strong we are. 
Show them how strong we are? 
Are you out of your mind? 
If we use the rods against the Americans, they will destroy our country. 
They'll bomb us, invade. 
And if we do nothing, they'll invade us anyway. 
That's what this peace treaty with your brother is all about. 
They're trying to turn us into another corrupt, Mid-East regime with your brother as dictator, kept in power by American guns and money. 
Isn't that what we came together to prevent? 
Is there no other way? 
America will always be our enemy. 
Remember, my friend even a giant can be toppled by a single stone. 
We need to make them fear us. 
Then I'm with you. 
So you said in your statement that you killed Vladimir Laitanan in self-defense. 
Is that correct? 
Yes, that's why it's in my statement. 
What I didn't see in the statement was any mention of your history with Laitanan. 
You did have a history with him. 
I worked an undercover operation with the FBI six years ago. 
Vladimir Laitanan was the target. 
And during the course of that operation, you had to get close to him. 
He became obsessed with you. 
He tried to rape you. 
Yes. 
But you were able to stop him. 
I fought him. 
Put me in the hospital with two broken ribs. 
I'm sure that's in there, too. 
You were able to fight off a stronger, violent man. 
It's impressive. 
But this time when he attacked you, you didn't fight him off. 
I couldn't. 
He had his hands around my neck trying to strangle me. 
I understand. 
You thought he was going to kill you. 
You were in fear for your life. 
So what happened next? 
Uh... He was choking me. 
I grabbed the knife and I stabbed him. 
In self-defense? 
Yes. 
You stabbed him in self-defense... 15 times. 
15 times. 
The first blow alone could have stopped him, but you didn't stop. 
Look at me, Renee. 
You were an investigator for the FBI. 
By all accounts, one of the best they had. 
Put yourself on my side of the table. 
Look at what I'm looking at. 
There's a dead body. 
On the one hand, I have your statement saying you acted in self-defense. 
On the other, I have these. 
Evidence of a sustained and furious assault with clear intent to kill. 
Now as an investigator, you know which version is true, don't you? 
I acted in self-defense. 
Let me tell you what I think happened. 
You used an operation of unparalleled importance to seek revenge against a target without any regard for the final outcome. 
I'm telling you, he attacked me first. 
Ms. Walker, I'm well aware of your sacrifice 
in service to this country, but I do not think that it is fair or right that CTU should be taken down because you used this operation to seek out your own personal vendetta against Vladimir Laitanan. 
I looked at your file. 
This isn't the first time you lost control. 
You almost killed Alan Wilson. 
That's why you got fired by the FBI, isn't it? 
Yes. 
I can see what this is doing to you, Renee. 
It is tearing you up inside. 
Let it out. Tell me the truth. 
You killed Vladimir Laitanan because the thought of him touching you again was intolerable. 
Do the right thing here. 
That's what happened, isn't it, Renee? 
Is that right, Renee? 
Put him into holding. 
No phone calls. No communication. 
I would like to see my son's body. 
We haven't found him yet. 
 What's wrong? 
 I've been trying to reach you. 
It's about Renee. She's being questioned again. 
I thought you said you already completed the debrief. 
I did. Hastings ordered it. 
He called in some woman from the Justice Department. 
Where's Renee now? 
She's in medical. 
Can you get eyes in that room? 
No. He cut off all access. 
What is going on? 
They're setting her up to take the fall for the failure of this mission. 
Sorry, sir. No one's... 
They're setting you up. Don't say another word. 
It's too late. 
What do you think you're doing? Get out of here now. 
How dare you? 
After everything she sacrificed. 
After everything she's lost. 
Have you no decency? 
Jack. 
This is over. 
Hands in the air. 
Do it now! 
Son, you better put that down or you're going to get hurt. 
It's all right. 
Go. 
Ma'am, hands in the air. 
Do you have what you need to turn the rods into a bomb? 
We're gathering materials. 
Must be difficult at such short notice. 
Explosives, no. Detonator? 
We're working on it. 
I might know somebody. 
A professor in the city. 
With expertise in electronics. 
You sure he can be trusted? 
Yes. 
He will help. 
He will do whatever I ask. 
But still... 
I will bring this up very carefully. 
I need to talk to him in private. 
Very well. 
There's a phone in the office. Ali will take you. 
What is the target? Is that decided? 
So many targets in New York. 
It will be hard to choose. 
Samir! Over here! 
It was Farhad. He escaped. 
Find him! 
Now! 
Cuffs off. 
Give us the room. 
Sit down, Jack. 
I'll stand. 
So, this is the new CTU-- you hang your own. 
If you mean Renee Walker, we're just asking some questions. 
Standard procedure. 
Standard procedure is a debrief, which Chloe completed. 
But instead, you've got some hack from Justice in there trying to initiate a criminal prosecution. 
We're just trying to establish the facts. 
You're trying to save your ass. 
I was there when you asked her for her help. 
And she gave it to you, and we acquired the target. 
And this is how you pay her back. 
I'm not going to let you do this. 
I'll call the White House first. 
The White House knows. 
Rob Weiss sent that woman over here. 
Sorry. Maybe I wasn't clear. 
I meant I'd call the president. 
Well, good luck with that, Jack, because I think the president takes murder pretty seriously. 
My recollection? She prosecuted her own daughter. 
Now, I'm not asking. Sit down. 
Sorry to interrupt. 
 We're busy, Chloe. 
 I don't mean to intrude, but I've got Farhad Hassan on the line. 
Farhad Hassan? 
I didn't believe it, either, but the voice prints match. 
Can you tell where he is? 
No. He's on a secure line. 
Can I just put him through? 
Mr. Hassan. 
This is Brian Hastings, director of CTU. 
There are people chasing me. 
They have the rods you're looking for. 
I thought you had the rods. 
No. No more. 
They turned against me. 
They have their own plan an attack on New York. 
An attack on New York? 
When, exactly? 
Soon. 
Very soon. 
Who are these people? 
They are IRK operatives working in this country. 
Okay, I need names. 
Just get me out of here. 
I'll tell you everything I know. 
We'll get you out, Mr. Hassan. 
I give you my word. Now, where are you? 
Forest Hills. 
Uh, some kind of boat warehouse. 
Hurry. I'm injured. 
They're hunting me. 
Hold on and keep this line open. 
What do you want me to do? 
Pinpoint his location and get me Cole. 
I can't. 
What do you mean, you can't? 
His team came back. He didn't. 
Owen said he was following a lead. 
All right, fine. Get me Owen. 
Tell him he's going to be leading the team. 
Owen? Are you sure? 
Just do it, Chloe. 
They're going to take you down and process you. 
I want you out of this building. 
Fine. 
Hey, hey, come on. 
What's the hurry? What's the hurry? 
What's the hurry? Your friend's a total freak show. 
Hey. I know, but come on. 
Don't go. I'll make it up to you. 
Okay? Come on. 
At least let me give you a ride back into town. 
We'll walk. 
Night, ladies! 
I take a leak. 
All right. 
Cole, what are you doing here? 
You're asking me that? We're in the middle 
of an operation, Dana. You can't just abandon your post. 
I can explain. 
You can explain later. 
Right now, I'm taking you back to CTU. 
We can deal with our personal problems after we've secured the nuclear materials. 
It's not what you think. 
Yeah? What do I think? 
I am not sleeping with him. 
Save it. I saw the pictures. 
What pictures? 
Just get in. 
 I am not leaving! 
 Why the hell not? 
Because if I leave, this will never end. 
What will never end? 
You do not understand. 
Then make me understand, damn it! 
I don't think that I can. 
Try. 
Okay. 
We don't have a lot of time. 
So you better start talking. 
My name is not Dana Walsh. 
It's Jenny Scott. 
Yes? 
You find Farhad? 
Still looking. 
I injured him badly. 
He won't get far. 
We don't know who he might have contacted. 
I'll be traveling with the rods to a secure location. 
Do you want me to come in? 
No. 
You stay here, and you find him. 
It's a six-acre warehouse complex in Forest Hills. 
Farhad is somewhere in one of these buildings. 
The rods must be there, too. Drones are airborne, 
but they won't have eyes for another 12 minutes. 
What about the police? 
They're redirecting their resources, but it's a big area it's gonna take a while to cordon off. 
Director Hastings. You wanted to see me, sir? 
In the absence of Agent Ortiz, I assume you're ready to take charge of the operation. 
 Yes, sir. Three units standing by. 
 All right. I'll walk you out. 
 There's a lot of pressure on you, Agent Owen. 
 Oh, I can handle it, sir. 
All right, talk me through it. What's the attack grid? 
Our working theory's that the nuclear materials are still in the proximity of Farhad. 
Teams Alpha and Bravo are tasked with locating and securing the rods. 
What about Team Charlie? 
They're responsible for the actual evac, sir. 
It's a standard urban searchandrescue we're in, we're out. 
Nothing standard about it. 
Wait here. 
Jack. 
Jack. 
You've got something to say, say it. 
Think about it. The people that are chasing Farhad 
already know they've got a big security problem, so most likely by the time your men get there, those fuel rods will be long gone. 
And you're down to one team covering Farhad? 
What if they run into resistance? 
What if they do? 
Well, at that point, you start shooting at people that have a higher intel value than the man you're going to try and save. 
Agent Owen knows the priority is to take all hostiles alive. 
Under fire? 
No assignment's more difficult. 
Agent Owen has my full confidence. 
Yeah. If that were true, 
you wouldn't be standing here talking to me. 
You offering to bring in Farhad? 
Yes. If you drop the criminal investigation 
against Renee Walker. 
Look, I know you don't want to prosecute her. 
I can be your out. 
I hear what you're saying, but I can't help you, Jack. 
I've sat in that chair before. 
The chair you're sitting in now. 
I know what it's like. 
There's a lot of demands on you, many of them unreasonable. 
But the people that last here, the ones that mattered... 
they knew when to say no. 
It's the White House; you don't say no. 
You are the head of CTU you've got a lot more juice than you think. 
Especially with a nuclear weapon in play. 
If we do this, Jack, it's not for one rescue operation. 
It's till this whole thing is over and done. 
You want Renee freed up, you're not in and out anymore. 
I want you in with both feet. 
Deal. 
Deal. 
I found an NYPD evidence warehouse in Queens with $120,000 from a drug bust just sitting there. 
It was only a matter of getting them in and out between patrols. 
Wait, you actually committed a robbery? 
Put yourself in my place, Cole. 
Kevin was going to tell Hastings I'm a convicted felon. 
He was going to ruin my life. 
What would you have done? 
Not this. 
Kevin promised that if I went along, he would never bother me again. 
Let me guess. 
He didn't keep his end of the bargain. 
That's why you're here, isn't it? 
What do you mean? 
What's in your hand? 
You were going to kill them. 
I don't know what I was going to do. 
You were going to shoot them in cold blood. 
Cole, listen to me. 
I was wrong. 
I see that now, but I was scared. 
I thought that I was doing this for us. 
For us? Are you out of your mind? 
I love you, Cole. 
Don't say another word. 
Not one more word. 
Cole, where are you going? Cole! 
Stay in the truck. 
Cole, don't do this. 
Cole. 
Please, I am begging you. 
This is my problem, not yours. 
Stay back. 
What? 
Hey, hey! 
Yeah, go for it. 
That way, I only have to deal with one of you losers. 
I think you got the wrong address, pal. 
Oh, do I? 
Somehow, I don't think so. 
Hey, maybe you should just tell us what it is you want. 
Maybe you should shut up and listen. 
Cole, please, come on. 
Let's just get out of here. 
I thought you looked familiar. 
Looky here, Nick. 
 It's soldier boy. 
 Mmhmm. 
No kidding. 
You know, it's a shame that you and I can't go grab a beer sometime. 
You know, just the two of us. 
I'm sure we'd have a lot to talk about. 
I said shut up. 
Now, the way I see it, you guys have two choices. 
One, you go back to prison for grand larceny and aggravated assault. 
I go back to prison, she goes back to prison. 
My guess is, she's prepared to live with that. 
Choice number two: I let you walk. 
You keep your 100 grand or what's left of it and you go back to wherever it is you came from. 
That's it? 
That's it. 
But if I ever see you in this city again... 
if I even hear about you crossing the state line, I'll skip the formalities and kill you myself. 
Do we have a deal or not? 
Yeah. 
We got a deal. 
Better be sure. 
I don't want to see either one of you ever again. 
Hey, what are you doing? 
Going after him. 
Why? 
Oh, we get rid of him, we're right back in business with her. 
Come on, man. 
We got what we came for. 
We got more. 
Now, let's just... let's not push our luck. 
All right? 
Come on, all right? 
We're just getting started. 
We're done. 
Okay? 
You got me? 
Cole. 
What you did back there, I'll never forget it. 
Let's just get back to CTU. 
Cole, I'm serious. 
Thank you. 
Cole. 
Jenny! 
I'm sorry. 
I shouldn't have come back.
