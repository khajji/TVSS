There's a situation, Mr President. 
There's a nuclear device, under terrorist control, that's on US soil. 
 Where? 
 Los Angeles. 
This bomb is going to go off today. 
Today's gonna be a very long day, and I don't want my own people working against me. 
Hey, you two! Cut it out. 
What? I can't kiss my own wife? 
She's not your wife for at least another 10 hours. 
When you asked for a background on Reza Naiyeer, I was proofing a file on another individual. 
Reza's name came up. 
There's a man named Syed Ali with ties to terrorist organisations. 
 Hey, sweetheart. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I just wanted to see you. I miss you. 
 Dad, it's too hard for me right now. 
 Then why won�t you... 
 Every time I see you, I think of Mom. 
Are you a complete idiot? 
I don't like when he gets like this. 
I need a few minutes with my daughter before I leave, OK? 
Did I not tell you to get outta here? 
Shut up! Shut up, Megan! 
What am I doing here, George? 
There's a rogue nuclear weapon here in Los Angeles. 
 How close are you to IDing a prime suspect? 
 The most promising one's Joseph Wald. 
Are there any witnesses against Wald in his trial? 
Marshall Goren. Apparently 
without him there's no case. 
You are Marshall Goren? 
No, Jack! 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 You wanna find this bomb? 
This is what it's gonna take. 
I'm gonna need a hacksaw. 
Quantico wants permission to relay the nuclear threat to their mid-level tacticians. 
 How many people are we talking about? 
 Between 600 and 700. 
Only if they assure they can contain the information. 
I will confirm that before I give them approval, sir. 
I want everyone to know that, besides the threat of a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles, I'm just as concerned with the dangers of panic and mass hysteria. 
Absolutely. 
So where are we on everything else? 
Well, NSA is taking a two-pronged approach. 
They're trying to pick up a trail on any known Second Wave terrorists, and they're also trying to source stolen weapons-grade nuclear materials. 
Yes, call the rep, tell them what the matter is, OK? 
Why can't she hang around? 
I said I'd be back in a couple of minutes. 
Thank you. Yes... 
Hey, Kim. Stay there. 
She's gonna be fine, OK? 
We'll work this out in a couple of minutes. All right? 
Hey, Donny? 
Yeah. 
Yes, no... Uh... It's... it's... 
I know it's late. 
Why can't she... 
OK. 
Right, right. Yeah, do that. 
Yes, I know. She's being a... 
No, no, no. 
No, everything's fine. It's fine. 
Yes, I know... 
Kim, take my keys. Get her away from here. 
Right. 
Tell them to wait until I get back, OK? 
I'll call you back. 
Come on! 
Kim! Stop the car. I will kill you. 
Stop the car! Do not do this, Kim. 
Do not do this. 
Star-Sat. Password, please. 
7073. I need to track 
the location of my car, please. 
We'll drop you three blocks from the salvage yard. 
 What about the car? 
 Ready, with a tracker in the trunk. 
Good. 
We haven't seen Wald come in the yard yet. 
 What about his people? 
 We're not sure. 
Any of these men look familiar? 
No. 
Yes, that's Eddie Grant. 
He's one of Joe's main go-to guys. 
When I was undercover, we were friends. 
As soon as I'm in, I don't wanna see any of our people. You keep everybody at a distance. 
You know any more about the size of the bomb? 
Not yet. 
Sir, the press is asking questions. 
They know you cut your fishing trip short and they'd like to know why. 
If you'd like, I can get Jenny to take care of it. 
 No, I'd better take care of it myself. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Sir, we've got a lot to cover. 
 I have to deal with the press. 
Sir, we have a serious situation and taking time out to coddle the media... 
What you don't get, Eric, is that once the rumour mill starts, we've got two problems. 
The last thing we need is mass hysteria. 
 Mason. 
 George, it's Jack. Let me speak to Tony. 
 What do you need? 
 Have you picked up Kim yet? 
Grothy just got to the house a few minutes ago. Kim wasn't there. 
 What do you mean? Where is she? 
 We don't know. She wasn't at the house. 
I told you to tell me when you knew anything. 
I was just picking up the phone. Relax, Jack. 
Don't tell me to relax, George. 
Grothy's gonna wait until Kim gets back. 
Meantime, you hang in there. 
George, just find Kim, OK? 
That's what we're doin', Jack. 
We're gonna find her and get her out of LA. 
 Trust me. 
 OK. Thank you. 
 Hi, this is Kim. Leave a message. 
 Hey, sweetheart. It's your dad again. 
I can't tell you how important it is that you leave Los Angeles. 
I'm sending a man over from my office. 
His name is Roy Grothy. 
He's gonna pick you up and take you over to Aunt Carol's. 
Honey, please, do this for me, OK? 
Call me back as soon as you get these messages. 
I love you. Bye. 
Paula, have we gotten a Division update yet? 
Uh, yeah. Tony, shouldn't we 
be working from outside LA? 
Why? 
If there's a nuclear bomb somewhere in the city... 
Try to tune it out, Paula. 
You never know how good the intel is. 
Almeida, we have a lead. Just caught 
a couple of coyotes at the border. 
 Who were they bringing in? 
 Not who, what. 
Michelle, you want to pull it up? 
Two forged Middle Eastern passports. 
The markings on the paper conform to a process used by some of our suspects. 
They were headed for Culver City. 
Let's get somebody over there. 
 Who? 
 Who's in the area? 
 The only one in that section is Roy Grothy. 
 Good. Send him. 
 George... 
 What? 
 That's who we sent to pick up Kim Bauer. 
 He's idling over there. Kim's not around. 
We promised Jack we'd take care of her. 
Fine. We'll send a gofer until he gets back. 
In the meantime, don't lose this window. 
 Hey, cowboy. 
 Can I help you? 
 I'm looking for Joe. 
 Joe? 
Joseph Wald. 
Sorry, man. I think you got the wrong place. 
Hey, cowboy. I ain't got a whole lot of time. 
Why don�t you tell Joe Jack's back in town, see what he says? 
Why don't I tell him, Jack? 
Why don't I tell Joe Jack Roush is here? 
He'd love to see the guy that put him in jail. 
Hey, Eddie. I just came to square things up 
with Joe. You know I didn't put him in jail. 
Sure you didn't. 
Get the back room ready. 
Damm it, Eddie. 
I got something I need to show Joe. 
The only thing he's gonna wanna see is you... dead. 
What about Marshall Goren? 
What about him? 
Word on the street is that he turned state's evidence, gonna put Joe away for life. 
Go on, Eddie. Look in my bag. 
 What for, Jack? 
 Think of it as a present for Joe. 
I told you, I wanted to square things up with him. 
Frank, give me that bag. 
Just open it. 
What the hell, Jack. 
I don't think you gotta worry about Goren testifying any more. 
Jack's back. 
Fortunately for me the vice president arrived when he did. 
We were both running out of small talk. 
Mr President? 
 Mr President? 
 Jane. 
We were told you were going fishing this morning. What brought you back so early? 
I already caught my quota. My conservation 
policy is coming back to haunt me. 
 Mr President... 
 Look, let's not have so much fun all at once. 
We're here for a couple of days. 
I'll talk to you guys later. 
 OK, what did Wieland want? 
 I think he's putting it together, sir. 
How can he? I just found out myself 
less than an hour ago. 
I'm sure he doesn't know the details, but Wieland knows everyone and they all owe him. 
OK... Keep your eye on him for now. 
If we go out of our way to put off the press, they'll know something's up. 
I agree. 
 I have to get back to the OC. 
 OK. 
What's this? 
 My head hurts. 
 I know, Megan. We'll be there real soon. 
 Where are we going? 
 The police station. 
You know what? 
We're gonna go down this alley. 
Do something, Kim. 
Make him go away, please. 
Where are you going with my daughter, Kim? 
Huh? Where you gonna go? 
Megan, honey, get out of the car. 
Come to Daddy. 
Do something. 
Get out of the car. 
Hurry! 
Move! Move, move, move, move. 
Kim! 
Megan! 
Megan, it's Daddy. 
Listen to me, pal. Kim is gonna hurt you. 
Megan, just call out to Daddy, OK? 
I'll come get you. 
Megan! 
Megan! 
Don't get that stuff tangled. We won't have 
time to separate them once we get there. 
 Who's that? 
 That's Jack. 
Are you outta your mind bringing him here today? 
He used to work with us, Dave. 
What the hell is that supposed to mean, Eddie? 
I used to work for Joe. I just did a nickel for 
him up in Gainesville. That's what it means. 
Oh-oh. Is that a fact? 
And he happens to show up today of all days? I'm not buying this, Eddie. 
He did a solid for Joe. 
He took care of Goren, Dave. 
 Well, if he can get to Goren, he must be... 
 Hey, Eddie. 
Look, man, I just need to speak to Joe, OK? 
Then I'm outta here. 
 I hear you, Jack. 
 If he's stayin', I'm checkin' him out. 
 Don�t you have something to do, Dave? 
 I'll birddog his records in two minutes. 
Don�t you think it's worth two minutes considering what's about to happen? 
Check it out. 
 Have a seat, Jack. 
 OK. 
 Jack what? 
 Roush. Roush. 
He's in. They just went online. 
They're checking Jack's background. 
Already? 
The network addresses aren't ready. 
Better send it to me now. Tony, did you 
backfill those Gainesville end dates? 
 Not yet. 
 I need them now. They're looking for it. 
 These guys don't waste time. 
 I can't believe they got in so quickly. 
 You want me to stuff some data in? 
 They want this now. 
I'm gonna forge their server portal and hope they don't look too closely. 
I'm not finding any release documents on this guy. 
What does that mean, Dave? 
That means he's lying. That's what it means. 
Keep lookin'. 
Listen, Jack, if this time you did in Gainesville doesn't check out, I won't let you walk outta here. 
It's gonna check out, Eddie. 
Anything? 
No. 
Come on. 
 Tony, I need it. 
 OK, I got it. Hold on, hold on. 
It's still looking. 
Wait a second. I think I found it. 
Yeah, here it is. It just took a little longer 
to come up than I thought it would. 
Told you it would check out. 
You almost made me shoot a friend, Dave. 
I'm sorry about that, Jack. 
You still got that '64 Mustang? 
No, the lawyers got that. 
Eric. 
Are we narrowing things down at all? 
I mean, are we making any headway? 
 It's too soon to tell. 
 Too soon? 
Aren't we assuming that this bomb could go off at any moment? 
What can I say? I've never been sanguine 
about our chances of stopping it. 
Not with just a few hours' warning. 
 What is that supposed to mean? 
 I'm not giving up, sir. 
Every protocol is being followed, every resource tapped. 
But I would give serious thought to your plan of action if in fact we have a detonation. 
I still feel a discussion with the Pentagon this morning is in order. 
Fine. Thanks, Eric. 
Yes, sir. 
Come in. 
I just spoke with Jenny. 
I'm afraid we have a problem. 
 What now? 
 Ron Wieland. 
He's convinced the network to give him a 10-minute live report today at noon. 
For what? 
He's heard the alert condition has changed and that you are managing a situation. 
Damm it. 
 He's going live based on what? 
 Jenny doesn't know, sir. 
But I'm assuming that he will avoid the facts and present the rumour. 
 I'm sorry, Lynne. I'm not mad at you. 
 There's no need to apologise, sir. 
How would you like to proceed? 
Set up a private interview in 10 minutes with Mr Wieland. 
 The condition is no one's to know. 
 Yes, sir. 
And, Lynne... 
Get Armus over here. 
Yes, sir. 
Hey, man. How you doing? 
 Get the hell outta here. 
 I just wanted to bum a smoke. 
I don't smoke, so get out. 
You're packing the fuses a little tight, sport. 
What did you say? 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey! 
 Makin' friends, Jack? 
 The guy's a moron. 
 What did Joe say? 
 Joe's busy. Maybe tomorrow, bro. 
I just need to see him for five minutes. 
We got this thing going down today, Jack, so swing by tomorrow around four. 
Yeah, OK. That's cool. 
It's good to see you, man. 
Good luck. 
It's time, Dave. 
 Mason. 
 George, it's me. 
 Did you get to Wald yet? 
 Not yet. His crew are shutting me out. 
 George, you gotta pick these guys up. 
 Why? 
They're packing charges. They're involved. 
If we pick 'em up, are they gonna lead us to Wald in time? 
I don't know. 
Well, stick with them until they do. NSA just 
upgraded his probable role in today's threat. 
Put him just a click away from the Second Wave terrorists. 
OK, I'll try and figure something out. 
Damm it. 
 Mr Mason? 
 Yeah. 
I've opened up that socket to Division you asked for. 
Thank you. 
George, where are you going? 
 Bakersfield. 
 What for? 
Following up on a lead. We're short-handed 
today so I gotta cover it myself. 
 Peter's assigned to Bakersfield. 
 I put him on something else. 
 What? 
 I don't have to tell you that. 
Well, I guess I disagree. 
I mean, if you're just trying to get outside the blast radius... 
Who the hell do you think you are? 
 Do you have access to my information? 
 No, George, I don't. 
Then keep your mouth shut and do your job. 
Get down! 
 I feel funny. 
 What's wrong? 
 My head hurts. 
 Where? 
Right there. 
 Is that where you hit your head? 
 I think so. 
Honey, we can't stay here. I need to 
make a phone call. You can rest then. 
 No! 
 Why not? 
 I can't. My head really hurts... 
 It's just over there. It'll be really quick. 
Please, for me. You can do it. 
 No, I can't. I don't feel good. 
 OK, listen, listen. Shh... 
We have to stay quiet, Megan. 
What do you wanna do? Stay here? Yeah? 
OK. But you have to wait. 
You promise you'll stay here? 
You promise? 
We're gonna put you in these boxes. 
I'll be right back. 
 I don't want you moving. 
 I won't. 
I'm gonna be really quick. 
Please, just don't go anywhere. 
I'll be right back. 
 This is Burton. 
 Hi, it's Kate Warner. 
 Did you get something for me? 
 No, I couldn't get his wallet. 
There are only a few things we can use to check out his connection to this guy Ali. 
 Actually, a passport would be ideal. 
 I don't think he carries that around. 
It's gotta be around somewhere. 
Check his briefcase. Look in his car. 
 Ralph, I can't just steal his passport. 
 You won't have to. 
Just write down the countries that have been stamped for entry over the last six months. 
Let me know, OK? 
Kate! 
 What are you doing? 
 l, uh... 
Craig said more vans were coming and they needed the space. 
 How you gonna drive it without the key? 
 I was looking for it. 
 Well, why didn�t you call me? 
 You were busy. 
I'm running for strawberries. 
When I come back, I'll park on the other side. 
Great. 
What are you still doing here? 
 My car won't start. 
 Well, take a cab. Beat it. 
You need to learn to mind your own business. 
 Hey, Eddie. 
 What? 
I hope this job isn't too important. 
Junior here packed your fuses too tight. 
There's no way it'll blow. He's a joke. 
See what I'm telling ya? 
Agh! 
Jack! 
It's broken. He just broke my ankle. 
 You broke his damn ankle, Jack. 
 He shouldn't have been playing with adults. 
This is the 911 emergency operator. 
Please stay on the line. 
Who are you calling, Kim? The police are 
looking for you for kidnapping my daughter. 
 Let go of me. 
 All right. OK. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm not gonna hurt Megan. I promise. 
I know it was wrong of me to push Carla, but I have been under a lot of pressure lately. 
You don't understand. 
I'm not a bad person. OK? 
You were right to take Megan away from that situation. I would have done the same thing. 
But, listen... I'm her father, OK? 
I need to apologise to her and tell her that she doesn't have to be afraid of me. 
You understand that, right? 
Yeah. 
Where is she? 
Why don�t you go home and talk to Carla? 
If it's OK with her, I'll bring back Megan. 
 You don't tell me what to do, OK? 
 I'm not... 
You don't tell me what to do. 
Tell me where my daughter is! 
Tell me where my daughter is, Kim! 
Tell me! 
And the last entry is Frankfurt, May 19th. 
 Great. That's a big help. 
 So what does that tell us? 
We'll compare Reza's travel dates with Syed Ali's. See if we can find a terrorist connection. 
Um... OK. Yes, that would be great. 
Thank you. 
There's the bride. 
Reza's parents are coming in early, so I called Brent's and I ordered lunch. 
 Good. I'll pick it up. 
 OK. Thank you. 
I finally feel like everything is under control. 
 Kate... 
 What? 
 I never thanked you. 
 For what? 
For everything. 
For being the maid of honour, for helping me with the wedding, for... being my big sister. 
 Marie... 
 I love you. 
Oh, honey. 
Oh, I love you too. 
Now, get to work. 
 Ron. 
 Mr President. 
Good to see you. Come in. 
Please, sit down. Can I offer you anything? 
Oh, no, thank you, sir. 
I understand you're about to go live with a story today. 
Just what is it you think is going on? 
I think the alert condition has been elevated and you don't want us to know that, sir. 
You think? 
Do you want me to tell you my sources? 
You know I can't do that. 
You're barking up the wrong tree, Ron. 
I don't recall the last time a journalist got a private interview with the president on a few minutes' notice. 
So... my 22 years in the business 
tells me I'm barking up the right tree. 
I tell you what, Ron. 
There's gonna be a briefing tomorrow. 
If you want a 30-minute jump, I can arrange it. 
Why are you horse-trading with me? 
Because if you go live with a story about unsubstantiated threats, you will cause mass hysteria. 
 That could be worse than the threat itself. 
 So there is a threat. 
Ron... we get them every day. 
So you want me to sit on this, even though it's my professional right to take what I've got on the air? 
Ron, you know me. 
I've been more forthcoming with the press and public than any politician you know. 
So when I ask you for a favour, I do it in the spirit of what's best for the American people. 
 Let me think about it. 
 Fair enough. 
 Thank you, Mr President. 
 Thank you, Ron. 
 Armus. 
 Yes, sir. 
 I think we're gonna have to deal with this. 
 Yes, sir. 
Mr Wieland, I'm Richard Armus. I'm with 
the president's Secret Service Blue Unit. 
There's something the president wants you to see before you go. 
 It won't take more than a few minutes. 
 Let go of my arm. 
You haven't changed much, have you, Jack? 
 What's your point? 
 I'm short a man and I'm on a schedule. 
I'm looking for work. 
This isn't a job. You're gonna 
do this for nothing, Jack. 
My price is a thousand a day. 
Well, Jack, I'd say you owe me a bit more than that for what you did to Dave. 
You do this, I don't tell Joe. 
You don't do it, you'll be too busy lookin' over your shoulder to find work. 
 What's the job? 
 You're gonna like it. 
Megan... 
Megan. Megan! 
Megan! Megan! 
Megan! 
No! Megan! No! 
Megan! 
Megan! 
Megan! Megan! 
Yeah, we're right on schedule. 
We'll talk to you in about an hour. 
All right, that's great. Rock out. 
 Where are we goin'? 
 West LA. 
 What are we doin'? 
 A conversion. 
What do you mean? 
Well, today we're turning a government building into a cemetery. 
 Which building? 
 A branch that's been dogging us for years. 
They call it the LA Counter Terrorist Unit  the CTU. 
Good. 
There are cabinet members who question whether you're fit to continue as chief executive of this country. 
We are invoking the 25th Amendment. 
I intend to show your erratic and irrational behaviour since the start of this crisis. 
You see the results. The vote is against you. 
Please remove yourself from the decision-making process. 
I swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States, so help me God. 
I got a message that the president called off the military offensive. 
 Is it true? 
 Yes. 
 You knew about it? 
 I did. 
Why keep my people processing intel on a scrapped operation? 
There's a strong possibility the White House will reinstate the attack. 
 Dad? 
 Sweetheart. 
 I've been trying to reach you. 
 Are you at the sheriffs station? 
They're taking me to the Mathesons' house to pack up my things. Glad you're OK. 
Me too. 
 Have you got the audio file? 
 No. 
Are you saying there's no audio file on that chip? 
If there were, they were destroyed. 
Michelle traced the sequence to a hacker named Alex Hewitt. 
 He created the Cyprus audio file? 
 Yes. 
I'm checking up on a man who engineered the recording. 
Are you convinced that the Cyprus recording is forged? 
Yes, sir, without a doubt. 
Alex? 
 Hewitt's not here. 
 I'm not surprised. 
Check the garage, see if his car's still here. 
Even with the delay, we predict we have not lost the element of surprise. 
As you can see here, sir, the primary targets are still relatively unguarded. 
Resistance should be insignificant. 
 When were these pictures taken? 
 Ten minutes ago, sir. 
Then we can proceed with the attack as planned. 
Yes, Mr President. 
I need your key codes, sir. 
How much longer will Prescott detain me? 
Until after the press conference. 
In a couple of hours, he's going to announce the US response to the bomb, and his ascension to the office. 
Your key codes belong to President Prescott now. It's protocol. 
Confirmed. 
Know why Chappelle called this meeting? 
No, he just told everybody to save their work and get in here. 
This information is confidential. 
It'll stay inside until it's been made public, which should be in the next few hours. 
The cabinet invoked the 25th Amendment and removed David Palmer from office. 
 Jim Prescott is now the president. 
 Why? 
That isn't relevant to our charge. 
 Yes, it is, Ryan. 
 What's your problem, Almeida? 
We know Palmer was removed cos he didn't wanna go on with the bombings. 
That makes what Bauer's doing more relevant. 
Bauer has cried wolf twice already. 
He's come up with nothing. 
I have an order from District that disallows any further resources from being expended on him. 
Why is everybody so afraid to look at all the sides of this? What if Bauer's right? 
What if it was forged and we're about to bomb three innocent countries? 
Tony, let me first say that your office has done a remarkable job today. 
There is no way the people on the Hill are not going to reward every one of you for your role in averting disaster. 
 What does that have to do with anything? 
 Let me finish. 
The success of this office today is due in large part to the technical team. 
The same team that has concluded that the Cyprus audio is an untreated, unforged original. 
There comes a time when you have to let go. Not every hunch works out. 
Bauer's chasing a ghost. 
I can't put it any simpler than that. 
That's all. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 I have to talk to one of Prescott's staff. 
If Jack comes in with the evidence, we need somebody in place to take it to. 
If Chappelle finds out you're doing an end run... 
I know. I know. 
 The car is gone. 
 OK. 
 What do you wanna do? 
 Kingsley took anything important. 
 We gotta find Hewitt. Let's go. 
 Stop right there! 
 Sit down! 
 Let go of me! 
Don't move. Don't move! 
Who are you? Don't look at her, 
look at me! Who are you? 
 I'm nobody. 
 He's my private bodyguard. 
 Secret Service? 
 Ex. 
 Mrs Palmer. 
 Jack Bauer. 
 Stand up. 
 Why? 
 Stand up! 
 What are you gonna do to me? 
Turn around. 
I'm not carrying any weapons. 
Take a seat. 
 Why are you here? 
 Trying to help David. 
 You're no longer part of his life. 
 Don't believe everything you read. 
David's asked me to pool my resources to see if I can find out who's behind the bomb. 
 I don't believe you. 
 I don't care what you believe. 
Do you know who did this? 
Who ransacked this place? 
 You're here for the same reason I am. 
 What reason would that be? 
 To find Alex Hewitt. 
 Why? 
 You must know. You're here. 
 Why don�t you tell me? 
He created a recording that's about to start a war. 
How do you know about that? 
I don't like the way this conversation is going. 
 How do you know about Cyprus audio? 
 How dare you talk down to me! 
I am not a politician. 
I will not debate this with you. 
Answer me. What do you know 
about the Cyprus recording? 
Every expert in the government with priority clearance has been working on it for six hours. 
I've got a lot of sources. 
 What do you know about Alex Hewitt? 
 That he's a freelance audio technician. 
 Who does he work for? 
 A man named Peter Kingsley. 
Why? 
Kingsley represents Caspian Sea oils interests that want the US at war with the Middle East. Kingsley hired 
Hewitt to fabricate the Cyprus recording. 
Mr Bauer, I've walked the corridors of power my entire life. 
You'd be surprised how much information you can get if you have something to trade. 
 What are you doing? 
 Take a seat. 
Take a seat! 
Come out! 
Open the door slowly, I wanna see both your hands! Now! Now! 
Please don't hurt me! 
 Get on the ground! 
 OK. OK. 
Don't move. Get on the ground! 
Who are you? 
 Mrs Palmer? 
 Alex. 
You said you would help me. 
Why does he have a gun? 
 Shut up. Go sit with her. 
 I didn't do anything wrong. 
 Move! 
 You said you'd... 
Shut up. Don't say anything. 
He's a federal agent. 
 Shut up. 
 I am not talking to you! 
 Shut up! 
 Don't say anything, Alex. 
Alex, don't say anything! 
You're gonna talk to me now. 
You took voice samples from three leaders and intercut them with Ali's for the audio? 
 I didn't say that. 
 And Kingsley paid you. 
 No! 
 You're a traitor. 
 You know what they'll do to you? 
 I'm not. I didn't know, I swear. 
I told Mrs Palmer. She'll tell you. 
Forget about her. She can't help you. 
But if you tell me everything about the Cyprus audio, I'll do what I can. 
 I won't say anything until I see a lawyer. 
 I am your lawyer, son. 
Those people you worked for thought you'd die in the bomb. They're after you. 
If you wanna stay alive, start telling me everything. 
No, I only wanna talk to Mrs Palmer. 
Why her? How's she connected to this? 
How do you know her? 
I just met her today. 
She called, said she could help me. 
I know she's the president's ex-wife. 
She's got connections high up. 
She can't help you now, Alex. 
I'm the only one who can help you now. 
I wanna to talk to her. 
OK. Let me see what I can do. 
Give me your keys. 
 Why? 
 Give me your keys. 
 Which one of these locks this door? 
 This one. 
Just step back. 
 What did he say? 
 Why are you here? 
Please don't tell me it's to help the president. 
All right. I came here to protect myself. 
Alex was paid by Kingsley to record certain conversations. 
Some of those were with me, they incriminate me. 
You're collaborating with Peter Kingsley? 
He assured me that the bomb would never go off. 
What were you thinking? 
What the hell were you thinking? 
 Who are you calling? 
 CTU. 
I'm a sworn federal agent. 
You just confessed to a federal crime. 
 I suggest you hang up that phone. 
 I need to speak to Tony Almeida. 
I am the only one who can get Hewitt to cooperate. 
And for that, I'll want full immunity from prosecution. 
Now hang up the phone and I'll tell you everything. 
 Jack, it's Tony, what's going on? 
 I'm gonna have to get back to you. 
Start. 
 Start! 
 I wanted to bring down David's presidency. 
I was so angry with David for what he did to me. 
I worked tirelessly for years to put him into office. I sacrificed everything. 
My career, my family. David betrayed me. 
So you wanted revenge. 
What did Kingsley want? 
Money. A war in the Middle East 
would triple the value of his oil. 
You're here to ensure no one connects you to Kingsley. 
Yes, like I told you, I came to protect myself. 
Look, Mr Bauer, there's only one person you need to prosecute for this. 
And that person is sitting in that room there. 
I want full immunity. 
Otherwise, it's just your word against mine. 
She'll talk with you. 
 I know you're scared. 
 You said I would be OK. 
I know there�s been a little wrinkle, but we can fix that. 
What do you think, Aaron? You think 
I'm unfit to fulfil my duties as president? 
Sir, I'm under orders not to discuss this with you. 
Are you under orders not to listen? 
 No, sir. 
 Good. 
Then I'll do all the talking. 
I assume you remember Jack Bauer. 
He believes the Cyprus recording, the single piece of evidence propelling us into this war, was fabricated. 
I've been removed from office because I believe in Bauer. 
If it wasn't for Jack, Los Angeles would be a killing field by now. 
Still, Prescott and the cabinet refuse to believe that he might be right. 
If Jack finds the evidence after the planes have dropped their payloads, then it'll be too late. 
We will be at war against three innocent countries. 
I'm sure if Jack Bauer finds evidence, Vice President Prescott... 
I mean, the president, will recall the bombers. 
 You're under orders not to speak to me. 
 I'm doing my best, sir. 
 Your best would be to help me. 
 By doing what? 
I need to talk to Jack Bauer. 
Find out if he's secured the evidence. 
If I remember correctly, you have a son in the Navy. 
Yes, sir, I do. 
It's a fine thing to defend one's country. 
You should be proud. 
Let's make sure the cause he's fighting for is the just one. 
Get me a sat phone. I need a secure line. 
Put these in the overnight database. 
Chappelle's gonna need 'em for his briefing. 
Why are you giving this to me? 
This is your situation report. 
I'm on something else. 
What else? 
I don't have to explain myself to you, Carrie. Just do it. 
You do need to explain yourself cos I think you're going behind Chappelle's back, trying to help Jack Bauer. 
Do you really wanna do this, Carrie? 
Come after me? 
I've been letting you get away with a lot, but if you want the gloves to come off, fine. 
What's going on here? 
She's asking me to take on some of her workload. I just wanna know why. 
Why don�t you wanna tell her? 
It's none of her business, Tony. 
Look, just tell her, so we can get back to work here. 
All right. 
District's asked me to step in as a liaison to facilitate the power shift. 
I'll be on the phone for the next two hours. 
Sounds like a promotion. Congratulations. 
 You think she believed me? 
 No. 
Go over it again. 
Look, I need you to find it fast, even if you need to pull agents who can help you. This needs to take first priority. 
Division's breathing down my neck for some reason. 
 That's something I don't need. 
 I'll take care of it. 
All right. 
 Mr Chappelle. 
 Yes, Carrie? 
In my opinion, Tony Almeida's not fit to run CTU. 
 Why not? 
 He's got Michelle working off book. 
 Doing what? 
 I can't say for sure. 
But I have a feeling the two of them are still trying to help Bauer. 
Thank you. 
It'll be fine. 
Here you go, thanks. 
 Almeida. 
 Tony, it's Jack. 
 What's happening? 
 President still holding off on the attack? 
Things have gotten worse. 
It's not public, but Palmer's been pulled. 
 What do you mean? 
 His cabinet invoked the 25th Amendment because he wanted to wait for confirmation of the recording. 
Prescott's now president. 
I'll bring evidence proving the recording's been forged. Prescott won't listen to it? 
He won't wait for it. Get me that evidence 
quickly, and I'll call Prescott with it. 
Start by sending a chopper to the address you gave me. 
 I got Hewitt. 
 He definitely made the recording? 
 Yes, absolutely. 
 Will he testify? 
We're working on it. 
If I go to Chappelle and request a chopper for you, he'll deny it. 
 He's got orders from District. 
 Deal with it, Tony. 
We got bombers in the air. 
Hewitt's our only chance of stopping this. 
I'll do my best. 
OK, thanks, Tony. 
I know, Alex. I understand your concern. 
But the fact remains, we both made a mistake. 
But we're lucky because they need us. 
Any deal I make will include you, and vice versa. Remember, we're in this together. 
Are you sure about this? 
Honey, I would never lie to you. 
But you have to remember this one thing. 
I am the only one looking after your interest. No one else. 
I know how these things work. 
Just do as I say, and it'll all turn out well. 
What about him? 
Don't worry about him. I'll handle 
Agent Bauer. He won't be a problem. 
He's very low on the food chain. 
So, if I do this, you can keep me out of jail? 
Absolutely. You'll be granted 
full immunity just like I promised. 
OK? 
All right, Jack, this is how it's gonna work. 
He'll come in and testify. 
He can demonstrate the technology in a matter of minutes. 
Good. The chopper's on its way. 
You heard Chappelle. He won't let us 
have a chopper if he knows it's for Jack. 
But Jack's got Hewitt, who definitely made that recording. 
 Chappelle can't ignore that. 
 He can do whatever he wants. 
Yeah. Mm-hm. OK. 
Let me get back to you, Marc. 
 What? 
 Jack Bauer just contacted us. 
Really? Where is he? 
 North Hollywood. 
 What's he doing? 
He wants to bring in the guy who forged the Cyprus recording. 
Fine, let him. 
He's too far away. We need to send a chopper. 
We've been through this, Tony. 
I'm done with Bauer. 
He's chasing a trail that leads nowhere. 
We're onto other things. 
More important than the US launching military strikes based on false information? 
The thing is, Tony, you've been reassigned. 
Reassigned? Where? 
I'll let you know in a few days. 
For now, you can go home. 
Ryan, you can't reassign me now. 
This recording is real. We are going to war. 
We need to prepare for domestic response. 
You have made yourself a liability I just can't afford. 
You've got 15 minutes to clean out your desk and get out. 
What are you doing? 
They took the disk that had my comb filter. 
I'll need to rebuild that file to demonstrate. 
OK, the tarball has to decompress. 
It'll take about 20 minutes. 
 How's it gonna work? 
 I'll make a recording. 
Right on the spot, shift it around, reframe segments. 
It'll have the same specs as Cyprus. 
It'll blow their minds. 
 Good. 
 And then I'm free to go, right? 
That's what she said. 
Yes, you'll be fine, Alex. 
How come you're being so nice all of a sudden? 
 What do you mean? 
 Before, it was all my fault, you called me a traitor, and now everything's "Fine, Alex"? 
 You're gonna screw me. 
 We won't screw you. 
You two made a deal, you're gonna hang me out. 
Alex, calm down. We can't hang you out. 
You have the proof. 
 Without you, there is no deal. 
 Then I want it in writing. 
 Why can't I have an attorney? 
 No time. 
There are bombers in the air to start a war. 
 You'll have to trust me. 
 Why should I trust you? 
Why don�t you have federal counsel meet us wherever we're going? 
 Excuse me? 
 One phone call. 
 That's right. We want federal counsel. 
 No. I'm not trading with you, Alex. 
You're gonna do your demonstration, then I help you. That's the deal. That's it. 
 I wanna talk to you in private. 
 What are you doing? 
 I handled everything. 
 What are you afraid of? 
I'm the one who can make this happen. 
I wanna talk to him alone. 
OK, all right, whatever you want. 
I'll be over here. 
 What's going on? 
 Is she trying to screw me? 
 No. She's trying to help you. 
 Why? I mean, she doesn't even know me. 
Maybe because she thinks you got tricked into doing something you didn't fully understand. 
She wants to use her influence with the president to try and help you. 
 Because she thinks I'm innocent? 
 Yeah, maybe. 
And I think she likes me. 
I think she does. 
 Do you need any help? 
 No, it should only be one suitcase. 
 Take your time. I'll be waiting in the car. 
 Thanks. 
He just reassigned you? 
He didn't give any explanation? 
Chappelle doesn't want me in the job. He's 
got his own people, and I'm not one of them. 
What are you going to do? 
Tony, it's Satcom. 
 Almeida. 
 This is David Palmer. 
Mr President, what can I do for you, sir? 
I need to speak to Bauer. 
Can you reach him? 
 Can you hold on, sir? 
 For a moment. 
 Yeah? 
 Jack, it's Tony. 
 I have President Palmer on the line. 
 OK, good. Patch him through. 
How we doing on the chopper? 
 Working on it. 
 Work faster. 
Here's the President. Mr President, 
I have Jack on the line. Jack, go ahead. 
Yes, Mr President. 
I don't know if you've heard, but I've been unseated. 
Yes, I have. I'm sorry. 
Where are you on your investigation? 
I can tell you the Cyprus audio has been forged. 
I have the man who engineered it. 
I'm bringing him in soon. 
We'll patch him through to the White House, so he can testify. 
Meanwhile, CTU is trying to process everything they can on him. 
Mr President, there is something else though. 
What? 
Your ex-wife, sir. Sherry, she's here with me. 
How did that happen? 
 Jack? 
 Yes, sir. 
 You can't talk? 
 No, sir. 
Don't trust her, Jack. Do you understand? 
Yes, Mr President. 
 Let me talk to her. 
 He wants to talk with you. 
 David? 
 What are you trying to do? 
 I'm just trying to help you. 
 How can you help me? 
You shouldn't have lied to me. 
That's the problem, David. 
It's not always about the truth. 
And what's that supposed to mean? 
The truth is, the Cyprus recording was forged. 
You are right and they are wrong. 
The truth is, you're trying to prevent an unnecessary war, and Jack Bauer and I are the only ones who can help you. 
 Stay out of his way, Sherry. 
 All right. All right, David. 
Let me talk to Jack. 
 Yes, Mr President? 
 I need this man to come forward now. 
 I understand, sir. 
 All right. Thank you. 
 Tony, you still there? 
 I'm here. 
 How much time have we got? 
 Six minutes. 
 Tony, can you hear me? 
 Go ahead. 
 We need that chopper now. 
 You'll have it. 
Thank you. 
I'm gonna need your help. 
I'm still here at the Matheson house. 
 Where is it, sir? 
 Where is what? 
Please, David, don't make me do this. 
Give me the phone. 
 Place Pierce under arrest. 
 Mike, don't. 
 I coerced him into getting it for me. 
 You didn't coerce anyone. 
Shame on you, for placing us both in this position. 
It should be you putting yourself on the line. Instead, Aaron did. 
 I tried to be a friend to you, sir. 
 I don't want a friend! 
I need someone to do the right thing. 
I'm sorry, Aaron. 
There's nothing to be sorry for, Mr President. 
Officer, is that you? 
Hello? 
 Dessler. 
 You ready? 
 Yeah. 
 All right, let's go. 
 Yeah. 
 Rudin needs you. He's in Holding Room 2. 
 Tell him to call me. 
 The comm's out in that room. 
All right, I'm on my way. 
Where's Rudin? 
I got this. 
Go send that chopper to pick up Jack. 
 When are your people getting here? 
 Soon. 
It's not just out of my own selfish desire that I'm trying to stay clean on all this. 
Really? 
It wouldn't be good for David's presidency if his ex-wife was implicated in this bomb. 
So, now you care about his presidency? 
In light of what's happened today, my resentments seem obscenely petty. 
I don't know what I was thinking. 
There's something I haven't told you yet about Mr Palmer. 
 Mr Palmer? 
 Yes, Mr Palmer. 
His cabinet invoked the 25th Amendment less than an hour ago. 
 What? 
 Prescott's president now. 
Oh, my God. 
You got what you wanted. Yeah. 
It's Tony. The chopper's about 
to leave. ETA's about 20 minutes. 
 So, Chappelle's on board with us? 
 Not exactly. 
 What do you mean? 
 It's better if you don't know. 
You'll have to get the Attorney General involved. 
 What for? 
 Mrs Palmer wants to cut a deal. 
 A deal? 
 Hewitt's testimony incriminates her. 
 I'll make sure it's in place. 
 It has to go like clockwork. 
 There's no margin for error. 
 I know. 
What did you mean, "I want to cut a deal"? 
I explained to you that Alex won't say anything without my permission. 
All I care about now is that he convinces Prescott and the Joint Chiefs that he forged the Cyprus audio. 
 After that, you're free to try and cut a deal. 
 That is not what we discussed. 
 I'm sorry, that's the way it is. 
 We'll see about that. 
Mrs Palmer, the conversations end here. 
You don't talk to him again, do you understand me? 
Don't try me, Mrs Palmer. 
Take a seat on the couch. 
Kim? 
You know this is all your fault, don't ya? 
Carla would probably still be alive if it wasn't for you. Probably. 
You think I wanted to hurt her? I didn't. 
I loved her. 
 CTU. Dessler. 
 This is Kim. I need to speak to my father. 
 Kim, your Dad's not here right now. 
 Please find him. It's an emergency. 
All right, hold on. 
 Yeah. 
 It's Michelle. Your daughter's on the line. 
OK, fine. Put her through. 
 OK, Kim, go ahead. 
 Dad. 
 Sweetheart, what's wrong? 
 I'm at the Mathesons' house. 
Gary was here. He has a gun. 
 He killed the officer that brought me here. 
 Where is he now? 
He's passed out. I knocked him out. 
 OK, get out of the house. 
 What if I killed him? 
It doesn't matter. 
Just get out of the house now. 
OK. 
Oh, God! No! 
 Kim, what's going on? 
 He's moving. 
 Grab his gun. 
 I've got it. 
 Shoot him. 
 What? 
 Shoot him. 
 I can't. 
I want you to point the gun at his chest and pull the trigger. 
No, I can't. 
Kim, shoot him now! 
Kim. You little bitch. 
Kim! Kim! 
 Kim, can you hear me? 
 Dad! 
 Did you do it? 
 Yeah. 
Again. I want you to shoot him again. 
Shoot him again now, Kim. 
Shoot him again now! 
 Dad? 
 Is he dead? 
 Yeah. 
 OK, sweetheart, listen to me. 
I'll send someone to pick you up now. 
Go downstairs and wait. Can you do that? 
 Yeah. 
 OK, baby, hurry. 
 Where you going? 
 I don't trust you any more. 
Everyone is looking to hunt you down: Kingsley, the government. 
We can help you. Without us, 
you don't stand a chance. 
 Hello? 
 Kate, it's Jack Bauer. 
 Is everything all right? 
 No. I need your help. 
My daughter was in a shooting, I think she's in shock. 
Take the police officer that I left behind with you, and go and pick her up and take her over to CTU. 
 I'm sorry, Jack, I sent the officer home. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 I don't know what else to do. 
 I could do it. Go pick up Kim. 
 Can you? 
 Yeah. 
Please call the police and tell them to meet you at 12, Bluetree Drive. 
OK, do you know where it is? 
 Yeah. 
 OK. I'll call CTU now. 
 OK, I'll leave right away. 
 Please, Kate, hurry. 
 Get out of my way. 
 No. 
Alex, get back to work! 
Sherry, stay away from him! 
I need to speak to Tony Almeida and Michelle Dessler. 
 Is it an emergency? 
 Yes, it's an emergency. 
Alex, you... 
Alex! 
Help me. 
Alex! 
I know Tony's running things. 
I don't want to speak out of turn. 
 I don't know who else to talk to. 
 About what? 
The president's planning military action based on a recording from Ali's apartment. 
 Ali claims it was a fake. 
 And you believe him. 
Sir, it's Jack Bauer for you. 
I regret to inform you, Syed Ali has just been assassinated. 
I think it has to do with the conversation recorded in Cyprus. 
 I don't believe it's genuine. 
 OK, I'm aware of his denials. 
I'm worried that someone is trying to manipulate you into taking the kind of military action I assume you're about to take. 
I told you I had money. 
I didn't come here to steal. 
I didn't want to hurt anyone. 
Give me the gun. 
 No. 
 We've got the store surrounded. 
 Oh, no. No. 
 Put the gun down and come out. 
This is Bauer. 
The recording they found, in case you haven't figured it out, is bogus. 
 How do you know that? 
 I'm the one who planted it. 
 What do you want? 
 Kate Warner. 
You got 30 minutes. Bring her 
to the warehouse, just the two of you. 
 Where the hell you going? 
 I don't have time to explain. 
 Let's find the time. 
 Put the gun down. 
Kate, come on, we gotta go. 
Now. Let's go. 
Jack! 
Come on. 
Wait, Jack. Tell me what's going on. 
Do you trust me? 
 Kate, do you trust me? 
 Yes. 
I will explain everything to you in the car, but we've gotta go now. 
 Carrie! 
 Tony! 
 What happened? 
 It was Jack. 
I tried to stop him from taking Kate Warner out of here. 
 What is it? 
 My ankle. 
 I'll get the medic. 
 Call Security. Make sure they stop Jack. 
Yeah. 
Security. 
He's at the gate. 
 Stop that vehicle! 
 Hey! Stop! 
 You OK? 
 Yeah. 
I didn't mean to frighten you back there. 
Let me try and explain everything to you. 
The US is preparing to retaliate against the Middle East for what happened tonight. 
In a few hours, we'll be involved in a war which'll affect every country on this planet. 
What does that have to do with me? 
Ten minutes ago a man called me. 
Said he had proof the evidence the president was basing his decisions on was forged. 
He wouldn't give me any other information unless I brought you to him. 
 Who is this man? 
 I don't know. 
That's the problem, Kate. 
I don't know who he is. 
 What would he want with me? 
 We've gotta find out. 
If I can provide concrete proof that the Cyprus recording was fake, we can stop a war. 
I will do what I can to protect you, but you have to decide now. 
You have to decide whether or not you want to accept the risk. 
Do you really think we can do this? 
I'm not gonna lie to you. 
This is very, very dangerous. 
I'm sorry, I don't know what else to do. 
I'm running out of time. 
 Did they stop him? 
 He drove through the gate. 
 What's the problem? 
 My ankle. 
Let's take a look. 
 Did you call LAPD? 
 And the FBI. They're all looking for him. 
Could be a torn ligament, maybe a sprain. 
It's not broken. 
 We've gotta get you an xray. 
 Great. 
I'll be right back with a first-aid kit. 
 You said Jack took Kate with him? 
 Yeah. 
 I don't think he was working alone. 
 What do you mean? 
Baker was keeping an eye on Kate. Michelle 
distracted him just before I found you. 
 Distracted him how? 
 She called him away on paperwork. 
That doesn't mean they were working together. 
I think it does. Michelle was talking 
to Jack right before she went to Baker. 
 He might have been setting her up. 
 It didn't appear that way. 
The vice president's ready for your call, sir. 
 When's he meet the British ambassador? 
 Right after he speaks with you. 
The vice president will want you to authorise him to inform the ambassador of our deployment. 
 He told you that? 
 You know where Jim stands on this. 
He'll want to let everyone know we're on a war footing. Especially the British. 
What's your position, sir? 
Once we bring our allies in on this, it'll make it much harder to recall those planes. 
 Put him through. 
 The president is ready to speak with him. 
 Right away. 
 Thank you. 
Hello, Jim. 
What's the British reaction to the bombing? 
Everyone is stunned. 
Their military is on high alert. 
 The British ambassador? 
 He's waiting to hear from us. 
After this conversation, I'm free to inform him about the Stealth bombers? 
Not just yet, Jim. It's still premature. 
Those planes are due to drop their payloads in a little over four hours. 
We're holding off notifying our allies because there's a possibility we may not go through with the attack. 
I don't understand. 
I have reason to believe the Cyprus audio implicating the target countries was fabricated. 
 I thought we proved it was real. 
 As did I. 
CTU LA is in the process of obtaining intelligence that may show otherwise. 
In the process? 
 Meaning they don't have any proof yet. 
 Correct. 
Did you run it by CIA? Did they have 
any indication this thing's a fraud? 
Not as of yet. 
Mr President, you authorised this military action, and justifiably so. 
With all due respect, it's too late for second thoughts. 
We will not start a war on false or incomplete information. 
 Say nothing to the ambassador. 
 Yes, Mr President. 
Mr President... 
I know you trust Jack Bauer implicitly, but to equivocate our response in a matter of this importance because of one man's reservations makes me very uncomfortable. 
I'm afraid I'm with Mike on this one, sir. 
Noted. 
This is Deputy Raynes. Mr Garcia, 
we have officers surrounding the building. 
Your only option is to throw your weapon out and come out with your hands on your head. 
Stay with me. No. No! 
I can't stop the bleeding. 
We need to get him to a hospital. 
 Please don't let him die. 
 We need you to respond. 
You need to talk to the police. 
Tell them you'll give up. 
 We gotta let them in here right now. 
 No, I didn't mean for this to happen. 
A bomb went off. There's gonna be a war. 
I was just trying to protect my wife. 
 She's pregnant. 
 I will tell the police that. 
 We gotta get out of here! 
 Mr Garcia, please respond. 
Do you have someone in there who needs medical attention? 
 We can work this out. 
 Stay with me. 
But first you have to put the weapon down and come out. 
Let's walk out of here. 
Come out, Mr Garcia. You're only 
making things worse by prolonging it. 
No! 
We can work this out, but you have to work with us. 
Oh, please don't die. 
 Please don't let him die. 
 Please respond. 
Why won't they help you, back at CTU? 
Tony Almeida's in charge. He's under 
pressure. He doesn't think it's a forgery, 
so he's following the proper protocol. 
He's doing what he thinks is right. 
 Where are we supposed to meet him? 
 A small warehouse in Studio City. 
 What is it? 
 We're being followed. 
 Who do you think it is? 
 I don't know. Hold on. 
Turn the ignition off! Put your hands 
on the wheel! Put your hands on the wheel! 
 You alone? 
 Yeah. 
 Why did you follow me from CTU? 
 No one's given me any information. 
I told you at CTU that my country is being implicated. I don't know who I can trust. 
I saw you take out Tony, who's in charge. 
You don't want your country to invade mine. 
My agenda is not to help your country. My 
responsibility is to make sure the president  makes his decisions based on fact. 
 My country's not responsible. 
Maybe, but Ali is a citizen of your country. 
He runs his terrorist network from there. 
Yes, which means he's a criminal to my government just as much as yours. 
Why would my country deliberately provoke an attack that would decimate us? 
We have everything to lose, nothing to gain. 
What do you want? 
When you broke out, you isolated yourself. 
You'll need help. 
 Tony. 
 Yeah? 
 What did the doctor say? 
 I don't know, they think I tore a ligament. 
Look... Carrie told me 
that she saw you talking to Jack, right before he took Kate Warner out of CTU. 
 Yeah. Is that a problem? 
 It depends what you were talking about. 
What were you talking about? 
Are you interrogating me? 
Did you help Jack take Kate Warner out of here? 
Of course not. 
Is that what Carrie told you? 
I'm in collusion with Jack? 
 Yeah. 
 I don't know what to tell you. 
She doesn't know what she's talking about. 
Look, Michelle. 
It doesn't matter whether you think Jack is right or wrong. 
The fact is, this is my command, and what happens here is my responsibility. 
 I know that. 
 So I need you to be honest with me now. 
Did you intentionally draw Agent Baker away from Kate Warner? 
No. I did not. 
 So why would Carrie tell me you did? 
 Because she'd like to see me out of here. 
 And why's that? 
 Because I don't like her, and she knows it. 
 You wanna tell me about it? 
 No, not really. 
 If it's interfering with your work... 
 It's not interfering with my work. 
It's not. 
OK. Thanks. 
Mr Garcia, we are contacting you by phone. Please answer. 
What have I done?! 
I'm going to prison for the rest of my life. 
 You don't know that. 
 I killed a man! 
It was an accident. I saw it. 
If you turn yourself in now, they'll consider that. If you don't, it'll get worse. 
I've got to get out of here. 
Hey! Don't touch that phone. 
 Yeah? 
 Mr Garcia, this is Deputy Raynes. 
Now, whatever the problem is, we can work this out. 
 Now, who's in there with you? 
 A customer. A girl. 
 OK, is she hurt? 
 No. It's the owner. 
OK, we have to get him out of there. 
It's too late. Look, I didn't mean it. 
It was an accident. 
Now, that's OK. Let's talk about it. 
It's because of the bomb. 
Look, there's gonna be a war. 
I'm trying to get my wife out of the city. 
You understand that, right? 
Your wife is right here. 
She's worried about you. 
Put her on the phone. 
I wanna talk to her. 
Ramon, are you OK? 
Why are you still in there? 
 Mija... I killed a man. 
 No! 
It was an accident, but they won't believe me. You and the baby have to leave now. 
It's not safe to be in the city. 
Ramon, mijo, come out. 
No, not yet. OK, look, I'm gonna tell the police 
to take you where you'll be safe. 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
All right, Mr Garcia, you talked to your wife. 
We'd like you to come out. 
OK, but I want you to do one thing for me first. 
What's that? 
Take her to Monterey. 
She's got a sister there. 
When she gets there, I'll let the girl go, and then I'll come out. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 I want you to stay here. I'm going in. 
If you need to get in touch, there's a cellphone in the centre console. Press one. 
Kate, you OK? 
Don't forget, I will do everything I have to to protect you, OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Just stay put. 
Drop the weapon. Put the weapon down! 
All right. 
My weapons are there on that table. 
I'm unarmed. 
Put your hands behind your head, interlock your fingers. You know the drill. 
If that's a Dunlop, it'll pick up a piece of shrapnel that's still in my rib cage. 
Yep, see? 
Take a seat. 
Who are you? 
Jonathan Wallace, 7th Light Armoured Reconnaissance Battalion, Third Marine Division, Special Ops Detachment Delta, Fort Benning. 
Slowly... raise your right arm. 
Show the inside of your forearm to me. 
 Coral Snake Unit. 
 That's right. 
So you're the seventh man. 
You took out your unit that was tracking the bomb so they couldn't stop it. Why? 
I was responsible for two things: making sure the bomb went off, planting the recording to blame it on the three countries. 
 To what end? 
 What else, Jack? To start a war. 
The end game was always to get the US to attack the Middle East. 
Why? 
They didn't tell me, but they didn't have to. 
These men control oil in the Caspian Sea. 
If there's a war, their holdings quadruple in value for at least a decade. 
At the cost of detonating a nuclear device in the centre of LA? 
You got it. 
What do you want with Kate Warner? 
About an hour ago, the people who hired me tried to have me killed. 
Obviously, they didn't succeed, but they took out my transport team. 
I need an alternate way out of the country. 
Warner Industries has DOD variance. 
She can authorise a departure. 
So, evidence against the Cyprus recording for your departure. That's the deal? 
Yep. 
Keep your mouth shut and get out of the car. 
Unlock the door. Do it now! 
Come on, get out of the car! 
You OK? 
 So where's the Warner girl? 
 When we're done. 
How does the evidence prove the recording was forged? 
I have the source recordings. Before they 
were mixed down to create the fake tape. 
 Yeah. 
 There was another guy. I took care of him. 
Is he there? 
It's for you. 
Hello? 
The man you sent to pick up Kate Warner is unconscious. He's out. 
You're lying. 
He's six-two, dark hair, pretty nasty scar on his face. 
OK. It doesn't change anything. 
I got what you need and I won't give it to you until you give me Kate Warner. 
I'll take you to her. 
We'll arrange your charter. 
No, no, no. 
She can't authorise a charter unless a partner is on board, and right now your people have Bob Warner in custody. 
So she's coming with me. 
What do you plan to do with her when you reach your destination? 
I have to dispose of her. You know that. 
I can't let that happen. 
We're done here. 
Wait. 
 Yusuf, do you copy? 
 We're here. What do you want me to do? 
Bring her in. 
Lynne. 
 Yeah, Mike? 
 How do I get ahold of Jack Bauer? 
Last I heard, he was debriefing at CTU. Why? 
The president's hesitating with this operation, based on a conversation he had with Bauer. 
I wanna to talk to him myself. 
Behind the president's back? 
That is so dangerous. 
If I can get some concrete information, I can support the president more effectively. 
And if you can't? 
Then I'll have the conviction to talk him through the situation. I'm in the dark. 
 I'm not sure. 
 Lynne... Lynne, this is my call. 
Your recommendation not to go around the president is duly noted. 
Thanks. 
Mr Almeida, Mike Novick, the president's chief of staff, is on the line. 
 Mr Novick, this is Tony Almeida. 
 Hi, Tony. I need to reach Jack Bauer. 
Yeah, well, we're trying to locate him ourselves, sir. 
What do you mean? What's the problem? 
Jack was here earlier, debriefing from the day's events, when he grabbed a material witness and took her off the premises illegally. 
 He also assaulted CTU personnel. 
 Why would he do that? 
Jack's working on a hunch that the Cyprus recording was fabricated. 
This is what I wanted to talk to him about. 
The president is not giving his complete support to the military action until he hears from Bauer. 
 I understand, sir. 
 Now, what about the witness he's taken? 
 How does that factor in? 
 Her name is Kate Warner. 
Her sister was involved with the Second Wave terrorists. 
We're trying to connect the dots. 
That's the other reason we need to find Jack. 
The second you make contact with Bauer, you put him through to me. We're at District. 
Yes, sir. 
 Turner. 
 Carrie. 
 What's up? 
 Yeah, I need to see you. 
Yeah. 
Yes, Tony? 
 Where are we on Jack? 
 His exit wasn't picked up on satellite. 
 He hasn't initiated contact with anyone. 
 What about Kate Warner? 
Her house and her father's company are being watched, in case they go there. 
Good. 
Have you talked to Michelle? 
Yeah. In fact, I wanted 
to talk to you about that. 
Do you have a problem working in the same office with Michelle? 
Is that what you think? 
That I'd be making up stories because I have a problem working with her? 
She and Jack were talking before he took Kate Warner. 
They weren't trading recipes. 
It was conspiratorial. 
All right. 
I need you to put a filter on all of Michelle's communications. 
E- mails, phone calls, open channels. 
I want you to let me know when Jack tries to contact her, all right? 
Done. 
 What's going on out there? 
 They're taking my wife where she'll be safe. 
And then what? 
 You're gonna let me go, right? 
 Don't push me. You got me into this. 
 I didn't get you into this. 
 You pointed this gun at me. 
That's how this whole thing started. 
What were you doing with a gun anyway? Huh? 
What?! Were you gonna rip this place off? 
No. 
You ruined my life. It's all your fault. 
 Sorry, I shouldn't have taken out that gun. 
 Yeah? Well, why did you? 
 I was afraid. 
 Afraid. What do you have to be afraid of? 
Answer me! 
My daddy died tonight. 
The bomb that went off, he was there. 
What? 
Your wife's on her way to Monterey. 
Everything cool in there? 
It's not cool. Make sure my wife gets there. 
You don't need to call every five minutes. 
OK, Ramon, you need to stay calm. 
Now, we're doing exactly what you said. 
You got to think this through. 
You'll be in custody soon. 
 I didn't mean to kill anybody! 
 We know. 
But what would help your case is if you'd let the young lady out now. 
I'm not stupid! She's the only reason 
you haven't shot your way in here yet. 
And I'll tell you something. 
If I see you coming in, I'll kill her! 
You better believe that! 
You're not a killer, Ramon. 
You've got no record. Be smart. 
I'll be smart. You be smart. 
Damn it! 
Get back here! 
No! No! Open the door! Open it! 
Open the door! Open it! 
Help me! Hurry, I'm at the back door! 
Help! Please! 
I don't wanna hurt you, but I will! 
Mr Garcia, what's going on in there? 
Oh, my God. 
 Mr Garcia, pick up the phone. 
 No! 
No! 
Please respond, Mr Garcia. 
Hey. Hey. 
Is there anyone else besides you? 
 Kate, look the other way. 
 No, no. No one else. There's no one else. 
 Come on. 
 Wait, the warehouse is that way. 
 Jack. 
 Yeah, go ahead. 
I'll approach in a sweep pattern. 
It'll take a few minutes. 
Copy that. 
 They're gonna be five minutes. 
 And here we are without a deck of cards. 
You know, I was down at Benning when Samuels tried to recruit you. 
Yeah. 
He was real disappointed you turned him down. 
He said you were a born killer. 
Is that true? 
 Turner. 
 I got an alarm on the backup server. 
 Do you have one? 
 No. Must be on your side of the router. 
Want me to check the connections? 
No, you need C-clearance for that. 
I'll have to do it. 
Right, I forgot. 
 Will you give this to Thomkins for me? 
 Sure. 
Thank you. 
 Mr President, may I? 
 What is it, Mike? 
Jack Bauer took a material witness from CTU and assaulted an agent in the process. 
I know how much this country owes him, sir, but he's obviously suffered some kind of emotional collapse. 
It would be understandable, given everything he's been through. 
But we don't know that. 
What he did might have been necessary under the circumstances. 
We already have incontrovertible proof from Langley that the Cyprus recording is authentic. 
Finding Jack Bauer isn't going to change that. 
The country needs your energy and attention on what happens after those bombs drop. 
We need to prepare for this war. 
If this recording's not authentic, and Jack Bauer turns out to be right, it'd be a mistake of historic proportions. 
 Mr President... 
 That's all, Mike. 
Find Jack Bauer. 
She'll be here any minute. 
Where's the evidence? 
OK, here's how it's gonna go down. 
I take Kate with me. She sets up the plane. 
It picks us up at an airport of my choosing. 
When I'm on that plane, I'll call and tell you where the evidence is. 
What assurances do I have you'll even call? 
None. It's one of those things 
where you're just gonna have to trust me. 
Well, I don't. 
Jack, you're the last person in the world I want tracking me down. 
 Jack, what's going on? 
 You and I are going on a little trip. 
Jack? 
You have to go with him. 
 What about you? 
 Jack's not coming. 
You gave me your word. 
I'm sorry it has to be done like this. 
Let go of me. 
Talk to her, Jack. Otherwise, 
I'm gonna have to do this differently. 
Kate, remember everything I said to you in the car. 
Do what he says, and I promise you, you will not get hurt. 
You're giving me up, aren�t you? 
 CTU, Dessler. 
 Hey. Hey, it's me. 
 Danny, what are you doing up? 
 I can't sleep. Are you sure it's safe here? 
Yeah. As far as I know, it is. 
As far as you know? What the hell 
does that mean? "As far as I know"? 
Danny, you know my situation. 
You know what, your situation sucks. 
You're talking about my life. The least 
you could do is tell me what you know. 
There's nothing to know. 
Stay where you are. 
 I'll come over tomorrow. 
 Don�t you patronise me! 
Don�t you patronise me, cos I want answers. 
A nuclear bomb just went off. 
I wanna know if it's safe to stay here in LA. 
What about the kids? 
Don�t you care about them? 
Of course. If there was anything 
to know, I'd tell you. 
Is that right? You didn't tell me 
about the bomb. Did it slip your mind? 
I already explained it to you. 
I wasn't allowed to tell anyone. 
You know what? Maybe I should 
call Carrie. She'd tell me. 
 I thought you weren't speaking. 
 We're not. She's a bitch. 
 Danny, I will take care... 
 Forget it. 
Don't shoot me! 
Please! I'm sorry! 
Throw the weapon out the front door, and come out with your hands behind your head. 
No! I need more time! 
My wife's gonna be safe, right? 
Come on, Ramon, you gotta cooperate now. You got nobody left in there. 
Anybody have a visual on the suspect? 
No. Should we hold position? 
No. Ever since the bomb, we got a new call 
every ten minutes. We gotta be done here. 
Please don't. Give him time. 
He'll come out on his own. 
All right, all units go. Go now, go! 
Drop your weapon! 
No. 
Code 4. Send medical... 
Medical team, go! 
 Thank you. 
 All right. 
 We ready? 
 Yes, we are, Mike. 
Mr Vice President, you're on with me and Lynne because the president is being briefed by Ryan Chappelle. 
He asked that we go ahead without him. 
 Fine. 
 How did it go with the British ambassador? 
Not well. He knows that we're planning 
a retaliation against the Middle East, but he's frustrated cos we're not coordinating with them. 
I'm sure he'll understand once he gets the facts. 
What are the facts, Mike? 
We've got planes in the air. 
Either we're committed or we're not. 
If the evidence shows that the Cyprus recording was falsified, the president wants the option of calling those planes back. 
You know what it sounds like to me? 
An excuse to call this off. 
Do you believe the president's capable of doing the hard thing, Mike? 
The right thing? 
Yes, sir, I do. 
He's committed to this action. All he's doing 
is making sure every base is covered. 
I hope so. 
The president will be contacting you as soon as anything develops. 
All right, Mike. 
Mike. 
You think the vice president is right, don�t you? 
If the president turns those planes around, based on the unconfirmed speculation of a single CTU agent, it'll be a disaster. 
So what do we do about it? 
I don't know. 
 Where are you taking me? 
 Get in. 
I'm not gonna try and escape. 
 I said, get in. 
 Kate. Get in the trunk, for your own safety. 
 The tracker's in place. It's been activated. 
 Good. 
Jack, it's been a real pleasure. 
I'll be in touch. 
Roger, it's good to see you. 
I'd like to talk to you about this meeting. 
I don't trust the ambassador. 
It's possible that his country's supporting Second Wave. 
We want to prevent this incident. 
We need access to your files. 
I want you to monitor how they use our intel. 
It's the ambassador's chopper. 
It crashed just after takeoff. 
 There's a man who needs to talk to you. 
 Who is he? 
He's from the Counter Terrorism Agency? 
I told you, I do not know a Syed Ali. 
Then how do you explain that his name is in your personal computer files? 
There's a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles. 
Do what I tell you. Go now. 
Miguel, get over here. 
There's a nuclear bomb in the city. 
 Let's get outta here. 
 Not without Megan. 
George, I got to Wald. I found out 
who commissioned him to take out CTU. 
 Who was it? 
 It was Nina Myers. 
Nina? 
Nina killed your wife. 
I don't want you near her. 
I have to grant her a shadow asylum. 
That sounds like a pardon, sir. 
She has information that could help us find this bomb. 
 What is it? 
 They're gonna let her go. 
I know you were exposed to high levels of radioactive materials this morning. 
I wanna know what your plans are for Nina. 
I want the case. I know how she thinks. 
If you don't do this, I'll tell District about your condition. They'll replace you. 
Palmer just signed the pardon. So, as soon 
as it gets here, we'll start the interrogation. 
 Nina's file. 
 I don't need it. 
The president's here. 
Mr President... 
Mr President, can you give us any details about the helicopter crash? 
 Who was on the aircraft? Any survivors? 
 Is it related to the bombing in LA? 
We can't disclose information about the crash until the families of the victims have been notified. 
But I promise you, there will be a careful and thorough investigation. 
 Mr President... 
 Let's go. 
We will be putting out a formal statement as soon as we get those issues resolved, and I ask everyone to refrain from speculation until that time. 
No one besides Jenny releases a statement on the crash. 
No names, no speculation. 
And keep the lid on tight. 
Absolutely, sir. 
Hello, David. 
How did you get in here without my authorisation? 
We were married for many years. Many 
people respect that, even if you don't. 
I need to talk to you. 
We have nothing more to talk about. 
You're not my wife any more. 
 It's not about us. 
 Then what? 
Not here. I need to be alone with you. 
You know what? 
Even if I were interested in what you had to say, today is impossible. 
You shouldn't have come here. 
 It's about your administration. 
 What about it? 
 Just give me five minutes. 
 I don't have time now. 
Did you order an evacuation of military personnel out of Los Angeles? 
Who told you that? 
Five minutes, David. 
Wait here. 
I'll call you. 
Do we know about the military moving personnel out of LA? 
No. Sir, you specifically requested 
there be no evacuation. 
 Check into it. 
 I certainly will. 
You're doing business with a known terrorist, and you sit there with a straight face and tell me you don't know what's going on? 
I grew up in London. I'm marrying 
an American girl, a Protestant. 
So, if you're going to racially profile me, you should at least get it right. 
Our main targets are European Muslims with western educations, passports, and the potential to blend into western society. 
So tell me, Reza, how's my racial profiling going now? 
I want a lawyer. 
No. 
 Did they find the black box yet? 
 Not yet, Mr President. 
How could something like this happen? 
I don't know. I've opened a multi-agency 
investigation. NTSB is on the way. 
Lynne, schedule a call with the prime minister. 
 Yes, sir. 
 I wanna talk to him before rumours start. 
But I'm afraid they may not be far from the truth. This was not an accident. 
I'm thinking along the same lines, Mr President. 
The prime minister may not have been happy about the ambassador's cooperation with us. 
There's another possibility, Roger. 
I'm not following you, sir. 
 That we did it. 
 Correct. 
That hardly seems likely. 
The ambassador took classified information back to his government. 
 You both thought it was questionable. 
 And if we were talking about it here, you can bet there are others back in DC who feel even more strongly. 
Set up an independent investigator. 
Let's find out exactly who was in the loop. 
Yes, sir. 
OK, this is it. Here we go. 
I'll show her this, I'll let her start talking. 
Then I'll get you the stuff she doesn't want us to know. 
The last time I let you interrogate somebody, you shot him through the heart. 
I'm letting you do this, but I hope I'm not making a mistake. 
No mistake, George. 
All right. Good luck. 
Let's keep this simple. 
If you wanna stop the bomb, I need to be on a plane to Visalia now. 
Did you pick Visalia for a reason, or would anywhere outside the blast zone work? 
 My contact is in Visalia. 
 Who is it? 
The only person who can tell us where the bomb is. 
I'm not gonna tell you who it is till we get there. 
Fine. Then you can sit here 
and wait for the blast to hit. 
Stop wasting time. 
I have the president's signature. 
I'm here. He's not. 
And I'm not gonna make a move until I believe you're credible. 
I'll only get the pardon if I stop the bomb. 
Why wouldn't I do everything I can? 
Because you're worse than a traitor, Nina. 
You don't have a cause. 
You don't believe in anything. 
But you would sell anyone out to the highest bidder. 
So stop wasting my time! Gimme a name! 
Don't even bother, Jack. 
If you lay a hand on me, you'll be taken off the case. 
You're just gonna have to follow my lead. 
Tell me everything I wanna know, or I swear to God, I will hurt you before I kill you and no one will stop me. 
 Do you understand? 
 Jack, let her go! Now! 
 All right, you're done. Get outta here. 
 Why? 
Why? Because you've lost it! That's why. 
Right now she thinks she's won the lottery. She's in control. 
You want her to tell the truth, take that away. 
By killing her? That'll work. 
By giving her someone to answer to, someone to be afraid of. 
She has to believe I'd be willing to put my revenge over finding this bomb. 
 And you're telling me you're not. 
 George, it had to look like that. 
Look at me. There's no emotion here. 
Now look at her. 
 What would your next move be? 
 You need to let me go back in there, show her that I have the power to do anything I want to her. 
 If I let you go back in there, you've got... 
 All I need is five minutes. 
Just don't let anyone in that room and raise the thermostat ten degrees. 
Are you gonna let me have five minutes? 
Yeah. 
Thank you. 
In the latest update, we have Mr President requesting... 
We need to talk. 
I told you to leave. 
Well... 
I'm not leaving. 
I'm your sister, and you can stay angry with me, but we need to figure out what we're going to do. 
Do about what? 
The wedding. 
We may have to cancel. 
That would make you happy, wouldn't it? 
Isn't that what you wanted all along? 
No. Not the marriage, Marie. 
Just the wedding. 
We can't do it today. 
Let me help you take care of it. 
You are always pretending you wanna help me. 
Pretending? 
I dropped out of school when Mom died to take care of you, to keep this family together. 
So you'd have an excuse for not having a relationship. 
"Dad needs me. Marie needs me." Now I don't 
need you any more, you can't handle it! 
 I made sacrifices because... 
 Then stop! Mom died a long time ago! 
So get your own life and stay outta mine! 
We are not cancelling this wedding! 
She's not in intensive care or the east wing. She's gotta be up here. 
How much time do we have to this nuke? 
 I don't know. 
 What if Megan doesn't wanna come with us? 
I don't know. 
That's him. 
Mr Matheson? 
The MRI confirmed that the pressure on the brain was the result of the concussion. 
Meaning? 
That we won't release her until questions about the sources of her injuries are resolved. 
Of course. Listen, I just wanna 
do what's best for my little girl. 
Good. I'll check in on her 
at the end of my rounds. 
And, Mr Matheson, no cellphones in the hospital. They interfere with the equipment. 
Of course. Sorry. 
Daddy, are you still mad at me? 
No, sweetie, no. Everything's fine. 
Daddy's just tired. 
You need to get dressed, OK? 
 Mr Matheson's office. 
 Chelsea, it's me. 
Do something for me. Book me two seats 
on the next flight to Mexico City. 
 But you have a meeting... 
 I know. I'm asking you to cancel it. 
 What about your five o'clock? 
 Cancel everything. 
Who is the man in Visalia? 
Who is the man in Visalia? 
Mamud Faheen. 
The man in Visalia is Mamud Faheen. 
That's not news! We've got his name! 
But you don't know where he is. I do. 
 What's the history of the relationship? 
 He introduced me to Wald. 
So Wald could buy the schematics for CTU and blow it up as a diversion? 
I didn't know it was part of a plan to detonate a nuclear device. 
Then why are you so sure Faheen's involved? 
I heard hints that he was involved in something in Los Angeles. 
Something substantial. 
Where is he in Visalia now? 
I'm not gonna give you his location until we get there. 
If you could get to him, you wouldn't need me. My deal would do me no good if I'm dead. 
Get me Visalia. 
Sir... 
Sherry was right. An evacuation of 
military personnel began about an hour ago, which means it is well under way. 
 Do we know where this order came from? 
 Yes, we do, sir. Roger Stanton. 
Countermand the evacuation. 
All forces already moving are to return to their bases immediately. 
Yes, sir. 
Roger. My office, please. 
Janet? Hi, this is Lynne. I'm gonna need 
contacts for the following bases: Point Mugu, Camp Pendleton. 
I got word that military resources were being moved out of LA. 
 Yes. 
 On your order. 
Yes. I was implementing the plan. 
I assumed you authorised it. 
No, I told Rayburn not to trigger any evacuation. 
I should have double-checked everything Rayburn told me before I took any action. 
Mr President, it's inexcusable. 
I take full responsibility. 
We'll worry about that later. 
I just told Lynne to countermand the evacuation order. 
 Make sure it happens immediately. 
 Right away, sir. 
 Can I help you, Mr President? 
 Yes. Tell Sherry I'll meet her in 20 minutes. 
You know how much Daddy loves you, don�t you? 
And you know how sorry I am that my little angel ever got hurt, right? 
Listen, pal, we're leaving now, OK? 
So if anybody tries to talk to you, you just... you don't say a word. OK? 
Just pretend you're asleep. 
You can do that, right? 
 OK. 
 OK. 
Mr Matheson? 
There's a call for you. 
A call? 
 You can take it at the nurse's station. 
 Why can't I take it in here? 
Because we don't have phones in the rooms unless you order one. 
You stay there, OK? 
Megan, don't move. 
 Looks like she'll be fine. 
 OK. 
 OK? Just running a few other tests. 
 Is it gonna be much longer? 
The phone's right in there. 
So let's go take a look, OK? 
 This is Gary Matheson. 
 Mr Matheson? 
 Yeah, who is this? 
 This is Trey in Accounts Receivable. 
Our computers crashed, and we lost a lot of your billing information. 
So if we could just go over it again... 
 Can we do this another time, please? 
 No, we need it now, sir. 
I can send someone up to your daughter's room. 
No. What do you need? 
 Hi, Kim. 
 Hi, sweetie. 
 Listen, do you trust me? 
 Yes. 
I need to get you outta here. 
All I can tell you is I'm doing this because I love you and I want you to be safe. OK? 
OK. 
Come on. 
 The expiration date? 
 It expires March 2007, OK? 
Great. Now if we could just 
go over your billing address. 
You know what? I'll come down later. 
Mr Matheson? 
Megan? 
 My daughter's gone. 
 Did you try the bathroom? 
 Yes. She's not there. 
 She might have been taken to radiology. 
Well, find out where she is. 
Yes, of course. 
Dr Shapiro, 2262. Dr Shapiro, 2262. 
 Where are we going, Kim? 
 I told you, you have to trust me. 
I just got off the phone. Come on. 
I changed my mind. I don't wanna go. 
My daddy's gonna get really mad, and then he's gonna hurt me. I don't wanna go. 
We need to go because your dad is hurting you. 
And your mom is trying to stop him, but she can't. 
He's gonna keep hurting you unless you leave with us. 
That's the only way anyone is gonna stop him. Do you understand me? 
Your daughter's not with any of the departments. 
 Then where is she? 
 I'm trying to figure that out. 
 Did you see anyone near her room? 
 No! Call security! Find me my daughter! 
Megan, I need you to breathe and calm down and stop crying, so we can leave now. OK? 
Come on. 
I miss my mom. I want my mom! 
I know. Come on with me. I know. 
Look out for a nine-year-old girl with blonde hair, striped top and blue jeans. 
I've got Third Street, west door covered. 
In there. 
Just got a team on the ground in Visalia, and more coming in from Fresno. 
Division's loaned us some men, so I'm sending Miller along with you. 
I can handle her myself. 
That's not what I'm worried about. 
Do you think I'd sentence millions to death just for the satisfaction of killing her? 
I'll do my job. 
I'm just sending Miller along to make sure of that. 
You should go be with your family. 
You should get on a plane. 
 I'll call you when we're in the air. 
 Yeah. Good. 
David... 
How did you find out about the military evacuation? 
I made some phone calls. 
Just following up on a rumour. 
I can't tell you any more than that. 
You will tell me more, and I will not ask you again. 
I am not a member of your staff, David. 
I am your wife. 
Ex-wife, and you will tell me because the safety and security of this country is more important than your power plays. 
You know, despite everything that's happened, I love you. 
 Oh, please. 
 No, I always will. 
Whether you believe it or not, everything that I have done has been in your best interest. 
If you won't give me a second chance at your heart, let me help in the ways you know I can. 
And I can't help you, David, unless you give me some idea of what you�re facing. 
I was able to find something your own staff couldn't find. 
I didn't have to warn you. 
I came here on my own accord. 
Terrorists have planned a strike against Los Angeles. 
NSA thinks it'll be today. 
What kind of strike? 
Nuclear. 
Oh, my G... 
Oh, my God. 
Talk to me, Sherry. 
Come on. 
I got the information about the military evacuation from someone inside the defence department. 
Who? 
A high-level staffer. He's in the loop. 
He owed me a favour. 
But there's something more important. 
He also told me that there are members of your own administration allying against you. 
They want control of your presidency. 
That's why I came here today. 
Who, Sherry? 
People who disagree with your policies, who want to impose their will on the country. 
There have been deals made under the table, David. Back-room promises. 
Now, I can keep digging, find out. 
If you want my help. 
If I accept your help, it won't be about us. 
It'll be about doing what's best for the country. 
Sweetheart, you can call it anything you want. 
I'll get you a secure line and a private place to make your calls. 
Then I'll come to you as soon as I find out more. 
This had better not be one of your manipulations. 
The stakes are too high. 
 Dad? 
 Hm? 
 Reza's parents are here. 
 I'm on the phone to your grandmother. 
I'll be right there. 
Oh! 
You're here! 
Welcome. 
 So nice to see you, Kate. 
 Come on in. 
Thank you. The house looks beautiful. 
Oh, thank you. 
Well... you must be tired. 
Let's go into the living room. 
OK. 
So, how is everyone holding up? 
Not too bad. 
Where is Reza? 
Um, well, there's a small problem we're dealing with. 
What kind of problem? 
Um, some men from the government are here talking to him. 
About? 
 It's a criminal investigation. 
 I don't understand. 
 It's very complicated. 
 Kate, what is going on? 
 It would be best if Reza told you himself. 
 Told us what? 
They're talking to Reza about his possible involvement in terrorist activities. 
 That is absurd! 
 This must be a mistake. 
 That's what they're trying to find out. 
 You see? 
Your country, you talk about tolerance, you talk about freedom, but you treat every Middle Easterner like terrorist! 
No! No, of course not. 
I'm sure it'll all get sorted out. 
 Rima, Hassan... 
 Bob, do you know about this? 
They just showed up about an hour ago. 
I know nothing else. I'm sorry. 
Don't worry. I'm sure it's nothing. 
Wait for me in the parking lot. 
If it's more than ten minutes, it means they caught me, so take off without me. 
You can't let them. 
We are gonna leave all together. 
OK? 
Miguel. 
Thank you. 
Are you OK to walk by yourself? 
Yeah? Good girl. 
Hey! Hey! 
I got a male Hispanic, early 20s, running out with a computer monitor. 
Hey, come on! 
Shh. 
Go that way! 
So, Ed, how are ya? 
Don't bother, Nina. 
I'm here because I have to be, not because I'm your friend. 
You're here because they think, after I help stop the bomb, Jack will try to kill me. 
Which, of course, he will. 
And what if you can't stop him? 
I mean, no offence, but, Ed, let's face it, you're no match for Jack. 
You're just not that ruthless. 
So he manages to get around you and pull the trigger. What happens then? 
Because of the pardon, he knows if he kills me, he'll spend the rest of his life in jail. 
Jack, if you have some way to shut her up I'm not thinking of... 
Of course, Jack's mind is thinking "That's not such a bad deal." 
Small price to pay to avenge his wife's death. 
But what about his daughter? 
Is he thinking about her? 
She's already lost one parent. 
If he kills me, she'll have no one. 
Jack knows I'm right. 
He should just use me to stop the bomb, and then go home to Kim. 
She needs you, Jack. 
 I didn't transfer that money. 
 You transferred it into that account. 
I didn't! 
Then you better tell me who did, or I'm taking you in! 
Why are you doing this? 
Friends of mine... 
who were doing their best to protect the citizens of this country were murdered today... probably by 
the same people you're funding! 
That a good enough reason for you? 
I told you before... 
I don't know anything else. 
Your parents. 
All right, stand up, Reza. 
Place your hands behind your head. 
It's a shame. It's gonna break their heart. 
I have to walk you right past them. 
And they're gonna see who their son really is. 
Wait! 
I confirmed the transfers, but I didn't make them. 
I was just covering the records. 
I didn't want him to get into trouble. 
Who? Who are you covering for? 
Come on, who transferred that money into Syed Ali's accounts? 
Bob Warner. 
Marie's father. 
What? 
 What's the matter? 
 I don't feel very well. 
Come on, Miguel. 
Get away from us! 
Give her to me, or I will make sure you go to prison for 20 years. 
 I know how she got hurt. 
 That was an accident! 
Like Carla's bruises? 
 It's OK. 
 Miguel... 
Let's just get outta here. 
Get his car keys. 
 Reza. 
 Sweetheart, angel. 
 You OK? 
 Yes. 
 They know I didn't do anything. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 We can get married today. 
 I don't know, sweetheart. 
Mr Warner. 
Could you follow me, please, sir? 
 What does this have to do with me? 
 Just come with me, please. 
What did you tell them? 
The truth. 
 The truth? What do you mean, the truth? 
 Please, my parents are very upset. 
Hurry. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. OK. 
The team's in Visalia. 
We'll have tactical and field units. 
We have confirmation that they're in place? 
Probably in the air. 
We'll have air traffic, um... 
Air traffic priority? 
Yeah... 
Tra... 
Jack... 
It's all right, Ed. It's all right. Just take it easy. 
Six hours ago a cache of weapons-grade plutonium was found in a warehouse. 
We also found this. 
What do you make of that, guys? 
 This is a bill of lading from our company. 
 For a container sent to Syed Ali. 
I can track the shipping order. 
The database is at the office. 
If my father really does work for the government, wouldn't he have known if Reza was doing something illegal? 
Who are you? 
My name is Syed Ali. You were 
looking in places you do not belong. 
 I don't know anything! 
 Kill her. 
No. 
We're going down! The pilots don't know 
what happened. It felt like an explosion. 
 They were shot down? 
 By a groundtoair missile. 
That's not Search and Rescue. 
 Are they coming here for you? 
 I don't know. 
Drop it. 
I'll tell you where the bomb is in exchange for immunity, for the murder of Jack Bauer. 
Someone from CTU is supposed to pick us up. 
Captain said it's out of their jurisdiction. 
 We told you why we can't go back to LA. 
 Yeah, I know. The bomb. 
Miss Myers, if the information you provide culminates in the interception of the nuclear device, you'll be pardoned in advance for the murder of Jack Bauer. 
Mr President, there was only one right choice to make and you made it. 
You've been told by a well-respected member of the press, Mr Ron Wieland, that there is an imminent terrorist threat levelled against this country. 
That is true, so far as it goes. 
Please. 
The fact is, we get a dozen such threats every day. 
And do I know more about them than I publicly reveal? Of course. 
What is released to the public and when is a matter of judgement. 
You have elected me to exercise that judgement in the best interests of this country. 
That's what I've done since I took office. 
That's what I'm doing today. 
And I can assure you that we have the situation well under control, and there is no cause for alarm. 
Thank you. 
Not the Gettysburg Address, but it should buy us time. 
It was fine. 
 What's the situation with Jack Bauer? 
 Still being held hostage by Nina Myers. 
It didn't have to be like this, Jack. 
I never meant for it to be personal. 
It felt pretty personal when you killed my wife. 
I had to. Teri overheard something 
that compromised my escape route. 
What about bombing CTU? 
All those people you used to work with? 
I didn't bomb CTU. I just sold the plans. 
You believe what you have to, but you killed your friends. 
Shut up, Jack! Shut up! 
Now we are done talking! 
We're just gonna wait for Palmer to call and then this'll all be over. You got it? 
You know what, Nina? You're right. I don't 
really wanna just sit here and wait to die. 
Don't move, Jack! 
I mean it! 
You kill me before they verify the information, you'll be in violation of your agreement. 
 They'll just slap your ass back in jail. 
 And you'll be dead. 
I'm already dead. 
Last warning, Jack. 
That's it. One more step and I'll shoot. 
Argh! 
 Team one, move in! Go! 
 Go, go go! 
 Move, move, move! 
 Grab her! 
Secure the weapon. 
Got it. 
 Notify the chopper. 
 Get her up. 
 Let's go. 
 We're not going back to LA. 
We've been through this. 
 I told you before. 
 I know, the bomb. Move. Walk. 
Forget about us. 
You wanna get blown to pieces? 
I told you who my dad was. 
You think they�d send someone from CTU? 
 Get in. 
 I'm not going back to LA. 
 Miguel! 
 Get down! Get down! Don't move. 
 I got him. 
 Miguel! 
 Careful. 
 Let's go. Get in. 
Yes. Good. Yes, I'll tell him. 
It's over. 
 Is Jack OK? 
 They got to Nina before she shot him. 
 What about her? 
 As you requested, she wasn't seriously hurt. 
They're awaiting orders. 
Do you want her taken to prison? 
No. We'll honour our original deal. 
I'll pardon her as soon as we confirm her information. 
 In the meantime, where do you want her? 
 Los Angeles. 
Let her share the fate of everyone she's endangered. 
Yes, sir. 
That's affirmative. I'll meet the chopper 
just south of the gully in the field. 
 Roger that. 
 Copy. 
Now... 
We're here to find transactions you claim Bob Warner had with Syed Ali. 
The sooner we do that, the sooner we're out of here. 
Have a seat. 
 I can't work like this. 
 I'll be keying the computer. 
How do I open the invoice files? 
 What? 
 I need to access the invoice files. 
 File, open, warehouse. 
 How are they ordered? 
 Chronologically, I think. 
 You think? 
Look, my fianc�e just left me on my wedding day because I'm sending her father to jail. 
And since he's my employer, that pretty much means my whole life's in the toilet. 
So why don�t you cut me some slack? 
There's a nuke somewhere in this city. 
And if you don't give me something useful in the next hour, I'll take you back to CTU and chain you to the roof, so you'll have a front row seat when the damn thing goes off. 
Do you want to suffer as he did? 
No, of course not. 
Then tell me what you�ve learned from your father's computer files, who you told. 
I already told you. I don't know anything. 
Jack Bauer. 
Jack? 
Mr President, the soldiers that attacked us at the crash site, they were Americans, or at least, American trained. 
What? 
One of the soldiers that was killed had a tattoo of a coral snake on his arm. 
That's a signature of a group out of Fort Benning. 
 What sort of group? 
 A deep cover special ops unit. 
The only reason I know about the tattoos, is because early in my career they tried to recruit me. 
Their commander is a Colonel Samuels. 
 I've never heard of this unit. 
 No, you wouldn't have. That's the point. 
They'd be buried pretty heavily in NSA's budget. 
NSA. 
OK. 
Even if NSA originally trained him, isn't it possible he's freelancing now? A mercenary? 
If it was just the tattoo, I'd agree with you. 
But the men that attacked us had access to our flight plan. 
The only way they could have got that information was from on the inside. 
Mr President, I know it sounds very far-fetched that we got attacked by Americans, but that tattoo is very distinctive and very specific. 
I appreciate the information. 
Where are you now? 
We're in a chopper. We're on our way to 
the address that Nina Meyers provided for us. 
We should be touching down soon, sir. 
Our ETA is 15 minutes. 
 Keep me posted, Jack. 
 Yes, Mr President. 
Jack's on his way to the Syed Ali house. 
Do you want a feed up here? 
No. I assume you have that under control. 
Yeah, we do. 
Was there something else? 
I'm sorry. 
So what are you gonna do tomorrow? 
 What? 
 If the bomb doesn't go off. 
Thought about it? 
No. 
You'll probably come back to work here? 
Of course. Why wouldn't I? 
I don't know. Are you happy in this job? Hm? 
Believe it or not, I used to want to be a teacher... a long time ago. 
You know why I didn't? 
Cos DOD offered me more money. 
That's how I made my decision. 
So I made myself miserable, and I made everybody else around me miserable for an extra $5,000 a year. 
That was my price. 
Sorry. 
You know, Michelle, I'm not a big advice giver, but under the circumstances... 
Don't wait around for your life to happen to you. 
Find something that makes you happy, do it. 
Because everything else is all just background noise. 
 Roger. 
 Mr President. 
Tell me everything you know about Colonel Ron Samuels from Fort Benning. 
I don't know anything about Samuels. 
What about a special ops units from down there called Coral Snake? 
No, sir. Nothing. 
How could NSA be funding a paramilitary group and you not know about it? 
Without knowing specifics, I really can't say for sure. 
My guess is that the Department of Defense has used some of their discretionary resources, attached our name for budgetary purposes. 
It happens all the time. 
That's absurd. NSA is information gathering 
only. They have no military mandate. 
I'd assume that this Coral Snake group, like many others that we see, falls under somebody's pet project, gets funded on the sly. 
How would you know that, Roger? A minute 
ago you told me you'd never heard of them. 
I'm just conjecturing from past experience, Mr President. 
I have no concrete information. 
Let me look into it. 
You do that. 
Jack Bauer's plane was shot down by an American military unit. 
Jack told me himself. I won't go into details, 
except to say that I believe him. 
American military? Why? 
I just spoke to Roger Stanton. 
I think he's hiding something from me. 
I'm going to arrest him. 
Arrest the head of NSA? 
Bauer said the unit that attacked his plane is connected to a Colonel Samuels. 
Samuels is funded by NSA. 
With all due respect, David, that's pretty thin. 
By itself, yes. 
But the ambassador's chopper crash, the evacuation of military personnel out of LA, Ron Wieland's escape from custody, those things happened after Stanton arrived. 
Firing Stanton will cause chaos. 
All the agencies report through him. 
He's running the search for the bomb, for crying out loud. 
If the president's right, he's not running it, he's impeding it. 
 Why would he do such a thing? 
 I don't know. 
But if he is, we have a better chance of finding the bomb if we get rid of him. 
David... 
you can't do this on a hunch. 
If Stanton turns out to be innocent and that bomb goes off, you'll be blamed for the death of millions. 
If you do nothing and he is guilty of something, you'll be blamed anyway. 
No, no, no. At the very least, we need 
to get some kind of proof, some evidence. 
You cannot just arrest the head of NSA, David. 
Sherry's right, Mike. We need proof. 
Find me a connection between Stanton and this Colonel Samuels. And find it quickly. 
LA County 470, go ahead. 
This is Officer Brown with Valley. 
I'm trying to reach Detective Bill Gucoff. 
Brown. You're transporting 
two suspects down to Central? 
 Mmhm, that's right. 
 Hold on. I'll patch you through. 
 Gucoff here. 
 Hey, Bill. 
 Yeah? 
 I'm bringing the prisoners down. 
 All right. You got everything under control? 
 The guy gave us trouble... 
 What? 
 Get the bandanna out of my pocket. 
 Why? 
 To start a fire. 
What? You're crazy. 
He'll have to pull over and stop the car. 
 And then he'll put it out. Then what? 
 I don't know. 
Maybe it'll do enough damage and we'll have to go back to the station. It'll buy us time. 
That is just crazy. 
Crazier than going to Los Angeles where a nuclear bomb might go off any minute? 
Hey, listen, this may sound a little crazy, but did you happen to hear anything about some kind of a bomb threat today? 
What? 
I can't do this. You gotta do it. 
 No. 
 Kim, you can do it. You're smaller. 
No, I haven't heard anything. 
 Come on. 
 You sure? 
Why? Somebody tell you 
there was a bomb or something? 
What's going on? You know something 
that I don't? What's up? 
I don't know. It may be nothing, 
but one of the kids here, apparently her father works for CTU. 
He gave her some kind of information about a bomb. 
Just check it out for me. 
Like I said, it's probably nothing, but... 
No problem. 
OK, Gucoff. Thanks. I owe you one. 
 Kim. 
 Hang on, OK? 
 Hello. Can anyone hear me? 
 This is CHP Station Six. 
Kim. Kim. Don't. 
We're on San Fernando, the 118. There's 
been an accident. We need an ambulance. 
 How's the officer? 
 Hurt. So is someone else. 
 Two injured? 
 Yes. 
 Stay there. We're sending someone now. 
 Hang on. 
All units. All units proceed 
to San Fernando at the 118. 
MVA. Officer down. Officer down. 
I'm gonna ask you just once more, huh? 
Who did you tell? 
No one. 
Here's an infrared of the house. 
Two people in this room. 
We assume one is Ali, but we'll need to take 'em both alive. 
 Your men in position? 
 In 90 seconds. 
 Good. 
 Yeah? 
 George, it's me. 
 Where are you? 
I'm on site. Syed Ali's in the house. 
We're gonna move in a minute. 
We need auxiliary teams ready to move as soon as we find out the location of this bomb. 
 We're already working on it. 
 I'll get back to you as soon as we get him. 
Agent Baker? 
Let me know when your teams are ready. 
This is Bob Warner's access code. 
As you can see, he logged on roughly twice as often as I did. 
 This is a restricted area. 
 I need to speak with Reza. 
I'm afraid I can't do that. 
 Just a minute. It's our wedding day. 
 I realise that. 
 We're in the middle of an investigation. 
 Can I talk to him for one minute? 
 Can I talk to Reza for a minute? 
 I tried to explain. 
 Make it fast. 
 Thank you. 
Marie? 
Hey, what I said before, I didn't mean it. 
I'm so sorry. This has been such a shock. 
No, no, no. It's all right. 
You are the man I'm going to marry. 
I know, whatever you're doing, you have to do it. I love you. Whatever happens, happens. 
My angel. 
We have to get back to work. 
You can wait in the next room if you'd like. 
Thank you. 
It was barely a nick, not nearly as bad as it feels. 
You don't have to kill me. 
Just leave me here. 
By the time someone finds me, you'll be 100 miles away. 
Something's going to happen, very soon. 
Something terrible, which will cause much suffering. 
This will be easier. 
Take cover! 
Fall back. Fall back. 
I have here a woman! 
If you come any closer, I'll kill the woman! 
 Bring in the shield now. 
 We need the body bunker right away. 
They don't negotiate. Yet they do shoot. 
It's not you they want alive, it's me. 
I'll try and take him out with a beanbag hit. 
Suspect is secure. 
You're all right. You're all right. 
It's all right. It's all right. 
Just relax. Take a breath. 
It's over. It's over. OK? 
 Jack, he's going into convulsions. 
 What? 
 Did you see him take anything? 
 I was watching him the whole time. 
Cyanide. He must have had it in his mouth. 
We need a medic in here now! 
We need a medic now! 
Copy that. 
Damm it! 
I want him photographed, fingerprints. 
Send it to CTU for analysis. 
I want confirmation that that is Syed Ali. 
You called them. You should go. 
I'll go when they get here. 
It'll be too late. They'll see you. 
I'll be fine. 
Thank you so much... for everything. 
As soon as this is all over, I'm gonna find you. OK? I promise. 
Go. 
Notify Dispatch. 143. 
 Did you get the area locked down? 
 Yes, sir. 
You should drink some water. 
Kate, my name is Jack Bauer. 
I'm a federal agent. 
You've been through an ordeal, but I have to ask you a few questions. Is that all right? 
 How did you get here? 
 Um... 
I was... trying to help my sister. 
So I hired a private investigator. 
Those men thought we knew something... 
Slow down, slow down. The dead man in 
the other room was a private investigator? 
Paul Koplin. 
What they did to him... 
They? There was more than one man here? 
How many men were there? 
Two. The other one left before you came. 
Did you get his name? 
 Syed Ali. 
 Are you sure? 
Can you describe him for me? 
Tall. Thin. 
Do you remember what he was wearing? 
A black shirt. 
With... silver buttons down the front. 
Black pants. 
Do you remember what kind of a car he got into? Do you know where he was going? 
Excuse me for one moment. 
Baker, this is Agent Bauer. 
Syed Ali is still alive. We are looking for 
a Middle Eastern man, wearing all black. 
I didn't get a make on the car. 
Send out an APB. 
 We need to find him now. 
 Copy. 
Kate, you said you came here to help your sister. Who is she? 
Marie. Marie Warner. 
She was supposed to get married today. 
Tell Mike what you told me. 
There's a back-channel communications network the CIA used to use, called OPCOM. 
It's been shut down for over 20 years. 
Last month, NSA was given orders to resurrect it. 
It was an eyes-only order issued by Roger Stanton. 
 I'm not sure that's enough. 
 By itself, it's not. 
Unless Stanton used OPCOM to contact Colonel Samuels in the last few hours. 
My source is checking on that now. 
Mike, call the Attorney General. 
Start working on this from the legal side. 
If we find this connection, we'll move on it, have Stanton arrested. 
I think we got a positive ID. Cross-reference 
his prints with the name Paul Koplin. 
 CTU? 
 Bauer. Put me through to Tony. 
Hold, please. 
 It's Tony. What's up? 
 I'm still at the house. 
I just questioned the woman that Ali was torturing for information. 
Her name is Kate Warner. 
Run a background check. 
 Did you say Kate Warner? 
 Yeah. Why? 
I had her family picked up this morning. 
I was with her hours ago. 
 What's the connection? 
 Reza Naiyeer, her sister's fianc�, had dealings with Syed Ali. 
He's denying it. 
He says it was the father, Bob Warner. 
Richards took Naiyeer to Bob Warner's office to hack into his computer. 
I have Warner here with me right now. 
Jack, will Kate talk to you? 
Cos her family's not cooperating. 
Yeah. But I gotta give her time. She's been 
through hell. You should see this place. 
Jack, there's one more thing. 
What? 
The father, Bob Warner, he freelances for the CIA. 
We're gonna have to start from the beginning. 
You'll have to run everything again. 
Start connecting the dots. These people 
are involved. You gotta find out how. 
 Get back to me when you've got anything. 
 All right, you got it. 
Gentlemen, I need you to pack up. 
I need the room. 
 Agent Baker? 
 Baker here. 
 How's Miss Warner doing? 
 Not so good. 
As soon as you think she's ready, bring her down to the bathroom. 
Will do. Baker out. 
Those three dates and anything the following week. Hold on. 
OK. Good. Let me know as soon 
as you find something out. Thanks. 
 Sir? 
 What have we got? 
 I found a way into the OPCOM channels. 
 Good. Tunnel in. 
The problem is, the files are pass code protected. 
We'll need someone internal to open them. It'll take time. 
Hold. No, it's not. 
I just got the name of a deputy director who's retired, but his code is still active. 
We could use that. 
Jean, could you hold on for a sec? 
Uh-huh. Let's see. 
 Try this. It should work. I'm back. 
 I'll head over to the OC and check it out. 
 Good. 
 Oh, that's terrific. 
Jean, I'm gonna cross-reference these, but I need you to stay in the office. 
 No problem. 
 Right. OK. Thanks. Bye. 
I'm collecting the dates that Samuels' office logged onto OPCOM. 
If Mike can trace Stanton's access, we can look for a match. 
 That's great. 
 If we have that, you'll have the proof. 
Stanton has a dozen staff who share his code. 
How are we gonna pin it on him? 
There's a four-digit subcode that only belongs to him. That's the one that'll nail him. 
 Sherry? 
 Yes. 
You're doing an incredible job here today. 
Thank you. 
I'd forgotten how talented you are at all this stuff. 
David, I've worked with you for over 25 years. 
It had to rub off on me somehow. 
I'm glad you're here. 
I have always been here. 
You remember that. 
Yeah. 
All right. Call me if there's anything. 
 That was Barbara at the Warner office. 
 What'd they find? 
Nothing yet. They're still going through 
the records. Reza seems to be cooperating. 
This is driving me crazy. 
It doesn't make sense that Syed Ali has a connection to this white-bread family. 
So you believe Bob Warner? 
There's nothing in his profile or behaviour that suggests he's involved with terrorists. 
I agree. But look at the facts. 
There is a paper trail between Warner Investments and Ali. 
Kate Warner was abducted for a reason. 
I know. 
Look, put together a list of all the managers and directors of Bob Warner's company. 
 I want to widen the search a notch. 
 Good idea. 
Anything else? 
Yeah. 
I was talking to Mason before, and... 
And? 
This is hardly the time, but I don't know how much time we have, so... I just wanted you to know 
that if you wanted to go out sometime... 
 Michelle... 
 I just wanted you to know how I felt. 
No, Michelle... 
I feel the same way. 
I've just been keeping my distance because... 
Because of what happened between you and Nina? 
Yeah. 
So you think I just want you for your information? 
So... what are we saying here, then? 
If we save LA from a nuclear bomb, then you and I can get together for dinner and a movie? Is that it? 
 I'll get that list. 
 Yeah, that's... 
Syed Ali left... after he killed Mr Koplin. 
They talked for a minute or two. 
They looked at me a couple of times. 
It was like... 
like I wasn't important any more. 
They embraced, and he left. 
Did they say anything to each other when he was leaving? 
Yes, but... they spoke so softly. 
And mostly in Arabic. 
Arabic? How can you be so sure? 
My family lived in Saudi Arabia when I was younger. 
When my sister got engaged to Reza, I picked it up again. 
Can you identify any words that they said? 
Anything at all? 
Salat. They said "salat" several times. 
It means prayer. 
But I couldn't really hear anything. 
They were so soft. 
Baker, this is Jack. Get ahold of CTU. 
I want a list of every mosque in a 15-mile radius. 
 Mosques? 
 They talked about prayer before Ali left. 
 The time fits. 
 Roger that. 
 Did that help? 
 Yes. 
Yes, I think it did. 
OK. 
Kate, the normal protocol would be to transfer you back to CTU for further debriefing. 
But the truth is, I don't know what Syed Ali looks like. 
No one does, except for you. 
I need you to identify him for me. 
 Stanton. 
 It's me. 
Excuse me. 
 You know better than to call me here. 
 They know about OPCOM. 
 How? 
 I told them. 
 What?! 
 David had the bit between his teeth. 
He was gonna find out one way or another. 
This way, I get him trusting me again, little by little. 
 What do we do now? 
 They'll connect you to the plane. 
David's having an arrest warrant drawn up as we speak. 
Stay the course, Roger. When this is over, 
you'll have everything you want. 
While, in the meantime, it's important that you don't talk. 
 Don't talk about you. 
 That's right. 
It's more important than ever that I stay in place. 
 How much time do I have? 
 Not much. 
Hold on. 
Here's the shipping order. 
It was entered last January. 
 Bob and I were both in Europe then. 
 So he logged on from overseas. 
That's not possible. It's not international. But 
it didn't originate from this terminal either. 
Somebody hacked in. 
Hold on. This can't be. I set up 
this program on my own computer. 
 You said you were out of the country. 
 I left my laptop here. 
Who else had access to it? 
Nobody. 
Except... 
Marie? 
I didn't expect you to find anything. 
I underestimated you. 
Well then, the last two years have just been... 
It's just been an act, is that it? 
I mean nothing to you? 
Huh? 
I don't understand. Say something, Marie! 
Reza... you really are very sweet. 
 What's the deal on this hit man? 
 Independent contractor. 
Rumour is, he got into town last night. 
 The guy who did the Rivera hit last year? 
 Yeah. 
Sorry. 
 Hey, Max. I didn't hear you come in. 
 How's it going? 
Hey. 
 Just came by to cadge some coffee. 
 Sorry. The market's been out for a week. 
Ironic, considering Seattle was the coffee capital of North America back in the day. 
Sounds like you got a situation. 
Who are the bad guys looking to whack? 
Not sure yet, but you can bet it's one of the good guys. 
 What do you need me to do? 
 Don't worry. We got it covered. 
Me and S1W are gonna do some recon, narrow the list of potential targets. 
I didn't want you to worry about it. 
I know you got your plate full these days. 
Yeah. Well, good luck. I gotta jet. 
What are you doin' later on? 
There's a party at Crash. It's Halloween. 
We'll probably be working on this all night. 
OK. Later. 
 So blondie was there at 8am? 
 Gotta get up early to save the world. 
Don't go there. You should see them 
together. They're so into their hero stuff. 
Hot run. 
Hello? People? 
Hello! 
Great. I'm talking to myself. 
687 Magnolia. Take off that get-up. 
You look like a weirdo. 
For your information, I am the shape of things to come. 
Demons, mutants, monsters, creatures not of this world, walking among us. 
It says so right here. 
 What is this falderal? 
 The press followup on the Eyes Only story about the Manticore escapees. Everything 
the government doesn't want you to know. 
You have an ass for a head. 
Now, bip-bip-bip. 
It's three o'clock. 
That's the time. 
D'you wanna give me the weather? 
It's Halloween. 
The whole town's shuttin' down early. 
 It's just another business day to me. 
 I'm not hearing it. 
 Why you gotta be so salty? 
 Whine all you like in that illiterate dialect, but we're not closing early. Capeesh? 
Normal, when it comes to a test of wills, you're gonna win hands down. 
 Cos you the man. 
 But at what price? 
You're gonna lose half a day tomorrow easy, just gettin' the toilet paper off the building. 
All right. Last run today 
will be at four o'clock. 
But I want all of you in here extra early tomorrow. 
Losers. 
Max. 
 Hey. 
 How's it goin'? 
Just another day in a broken world. 
Yeah. There's a party tonight at Crash. 
I was wondering if you were gonna go. 
 Thinkin' on it. 
 So maybe I'll catch you there. 
Maybe. 
 What did your boy want? 
 To hang out. 
 And you said? 
 Maybe. 
Maybe. That is a sign of mental health. 
I ever tell you ladies the one about the priest, the minister and the rabbi? 
 Every day, Murray, every day. 
 Good one. 
 What are you gonna go as tonight? 
 Either Snow Ho and the Seven Little Pimps or Rick James. I'm thinkin' Super Freak, 
but depends on the curl activator. 
Can we go by Joshua's? 
I've got groceries to drop off. 
Let's say hey to doggy-dog. 
They designed her to be the perfect soldier, a human weapon. 
Then she escaped. 
In a future not far from now, in a broken world, she is haunted by her past. 
She cannot run. 
She must fight to discover her destiny. 
Trick or treat? Did I scare you? 
Why they call it Halloween, boo. 
So, you got candy? 
Me and my crew have got a carton of eggs. 
Here's five bucks. Beat it. 
Cool costume, mister. 
Are you all right? 
I used to live in a crib kinda like this with a Dominican sister named Veronica. 
Aye, mommy. 
Joshua, we can't stay too long. 
We're going out tonight. 
Halloween. 
"Cool costume, mister." 
Max and Joshua, outside with up-there people. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
Do you wanna end up in a cage? 
Lived in cage. Down there, cage. Basement. 
No, a real cage, like an animal in a zoo. 
That's if they don't just kill you. 
Tonight, up-here people look like Joshua. 
Tonight, safe. 
He's got a point. Halloween's 
the one night when he can get his swerve on. 
Get my swerve on. Tricks and treats. 
What's the worst thing that could happen? 
I know you think you're trying to help. Don't. 
You gotta promise me you won't go out. 
You have to lay low. 
Trust me. I'm lookin' out for you. 
OK. 
Lay low. 
Read Father's books. Little Women. 
Good. 
I got you some of those snack cakes you like. 
I've been thinkin' about a nice hot bath all day. 
I've been thinkin' about Joshua all alone while the rest of the world is having a party. 
What am I supposed to do? 
Let him tag along with me? 
"Hey, gang. Say hi to Joshua, 
my transgenic mutant friend." 
Everyone's gonna think it's a costume. 
He's better off where he is. No one can ask 
him any questions or make any judgments. 
Judgements about who? Him or you? 
Look, all I wanna be is a nice normal girl, and have a nice normal Halloween. 
Whatever normal means. 
Wake up, boo. 
I'm awake. 
 Your boy's here. 
 My boy? 
Your date. Rafer. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 No costume? 
 I don't really do Halloween. You? 
I'm a genetically engineered killing machine escaped from a government lab. 
You don't read the tabloids? 
Weren't we supposed to meet at Crash? 
Yeah. This is kind of embarrassing, 
but would you mind coming by my mom's place with me? 
But would you mind coming by my mom's place with me? 
 Your mom? 
 She really wants to meet you. 
Is that a problem? 
No. Not at all. 
Rafer. 
And this must be Max. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 He's told me so much about you. 
I said I must meet this special girl. 
 I'm not so special. 
 Come. Let me tell your fortune. 
I don't know... 
I can really see the family resemblance. 
Max is not your name. 
You two have the same nose. 
 Your name is... 
 Guevara. Max Guevara. 
No. 
It says so right here on my sector pass. 
You have no name, only a number. 
I see secrets, dark secrets, wrapped in mystery, shrouded in illusion. 
You are not what you seem! 
Guess you busted me on my push-up bra. 
You are running from something. 
Running from your past. 
 I was gawky in high school. 
 No matter where you run there is danger. 
I see danger all around. 
And then I see... 
I see nothing. 
Except a face! 
Whose face? Is it a guy? 
A girl, then. With blonde hair, right? 
It is neither man nor woman. 
It is the face of... 
death! 
Mom, are you OK? 
Let's get you some water. 
Great first impression. 
I thought I told you to stay home. 
Max and Joshua outside. 
You just don't see fabric like this any more. 
My mom's OK. Sometimes she gets 
a little carried away, but she likes you. 
 That's great. 
 Rafer, my son! 
Be right back. 
 Max and Joshua gotta blaze. 
 Go home. 
Pretty wack. 
If I go out there for one minute, will you go away? 
 Lay low till you say so. 
 OK. 
 How'd you find me? 
 Original Cindy said "She's with hot boy." 
What was so damn important it couldn't wait? 
 Sally. 
 Sally? Sally who? 
Sally. 
Sally. 
Is he dead? 
Do I look like I'm dead? 
Do I sound like I'm dead? 
Criminy, I thought you said she was an X5. 
X5. 
What happened? 
All you need to know, dollface, is I had an accident. 
Being a Manticore alum myself, I can't exactly beat feet to the emergency room now, can I? 
 You're a Nomlie. 
 An anomaly? 
Hell, no. I'm exactly what they wanted. 
Designed with cartilage instead of bone. 
Good news is I don't fracture in battle. 
Bad news, I get bent out of shape sometimes. 
I guess. 
Well, don't just stand there gawking like a couple of chuckleheads. Do something. 
I'll immobilise his upper body while you rotate his head back into position. 
I'll move his shoulders this way. 
You move his head the other way. 
Put your back into it. 
I haven't got all night. 
On three. 
One, two, three. 
Now you've done it. 
This can't be happening. 
You never seen a soldier whose body parts are self-sustaining and regenerative? 
Starfish. Starfish in his cocktail. 
I can take a direct mortar hit and shake it off. 
Incoming! 
What are you doing? 
Get your ass back here! 
What can I do? Body's got a mind of its own. 
Rover doesn't have a prayer. 
I run like the wind, baby. 
 Body's gone. Very fast. 
 Like I said. 
We gotta do something fast. I don't need 
a headless transgenic on the loose. 
Max! 
 Where'd you disappear to? 
 Rafer... 
 Say hi to my friend Joshua. 
 Tricks and treats. 
Cool costume. 
Rafer, I was wondering, can we borrow your car to run an errand? 
 Sure. Yeah, I guess. 
 Cool. Meet you out front. 
We need reinforcements. 
You need to call some people. 
 Who? 
 Couple of transgenic colleagues are in town. 
 Sure that's a good idea? 
 Just get me to a phone. 
 We set to go? 
 In a sec. 
They just... I mean... 
He just needed to make a phone call... 
Joshua needed to make a phone call. 
So, you're a paramedic. 
Yeah, right. 
Cool. You probably see some 
really gruesome stuff out there, right? 
 Yeah, sometimes. 
 Tornoff limbs. 
Guts hangin' out. 
 Decapitations. 
 Not a lot of those, thank God. 
But you'd know what to do if someone's head was off and needed to be put back on? 
You could handle it? 
Once someone's head comes off, it pretty much stays off. 
Right. 
It's ringing. 
OK, Lassie, you align the receiver to my ear so I can communicate with the person who's going to answer on the other end. 
Other way, moron. 
Hello? 
 Hey, baby, it's me. 
 Me, who? 
Don't be like that. It's Sally. 
You mean Sally who stood me up for the third time straight last night? 
 I'm not talking to him. 
 Wait. I will make it up to you later, kitten. 
Right now, I'm in a situation, extreme in nature. 
 Get my drift? 
 Let me guess. 
 The business part of you's run off again? 
 Matter of fact, yes. 
But I still got man skills, sugar. 
Don't even try and get on my good side. 
Fun and games aside, I gotta get the rest of me back, pronto. 
Hook me up with your lizard buddy. 
We gotta strategise. 
Hold on. 
 Speak. 
 Sally's on the line. 
His body's gone AWOL again and we're putting together a search party. 
Sorry. Me and Chad 
are going to a Halloween party. 
Chad? Who the hell is Chad? 
My life partner. And watch your language. 
We've been out for three months and you've already got a life partner? 
You never know when love will find you. 
Chad's worked on his costume. 
I can't let him down. 
Listen to me, frog boy. 
I'm in a major situation and I need backup. 
Tell your life partner you have other plans, and get your slimy butt in gear. 
 Capeesh? 
 Gotta blaze. 
 So where are we going? 
 To meet some friends. 
Am I going the right way here? 
Good thing I'm without my stomach. 
I'd be losing it right about now. 
Quiet! 
Quiet. The ambulance sure is quiet 
without the sirens going. 
So, Joshua, you're what? 
A Wookiee? A Planet of the Apes guy? 
 Special. First. 
 First what? 
First prize. He won first prize 
for his costume at school. 
He's an exchange student. 
You know, English as a second language. 
 Way to go. Where you from? 
 Father. 
 Father... land. 
 I always wanted to visit Germany. 
This is gonna be a long night. 
 So what kinda errand are we running? 
 Looking everywhere. 
It's like a tradition in Germany this time of year to look for stuff. 
 Like a scavenger hunt? 
 Exactly. 
 Kinda like an Oktoberfest thing. 
 Exactly. 
 I'm down with that. 
 Fest thing. 
 Stop. 
 Where? 
Here. 
 Are you coming? 
 Yeah. My foot fell asleep. I'll be right in. 
All right. 
I'm suffocating under here. 
While we're in there, not one peep outta you. 
Easy. 
Come on. 
Are you guys from Germany too? 
Yeah. This is Dieter and Katarina. 
Call me Kat. 
I thought his costume was great, but you guys are tight. 
What are you? 
A desert-acclimated combat soldier? 
 Wide receiver. 
 Reinforcement. 
He means they're part of our scavenger-hunt team. Right? 
 Right. 
 Right. 
Easy on the caffeine. 
 Tonight's special is haggis. 
 Haggis? What's haggis? 
Heart, liver, lung of a sheep, minced with suet, onions and oatmeal, boiled in the animal's stomach. 
Comes with fries or coleslaw. 
Haggis. 
 I'll have the haggis. 
 I'll have the haggis. 
 Just water. 
 Nothing for me, thanks. 
Haggis, haggis, haggis, one water, one nothing. 
The sandbox is over there. 
Here's the deal. Under no circumstances can 
that guy know he's rolling with transgenics. 
Mess up and your mutant asses will be kicked. 
Yeah. 
Any idea where your body might be? 
 Not a clue. 
 Think. 
Excuse me for being a little light-headed, no thanks to you. 
 I think I'm supposed to meet somebody. 
 Who? 
A female. Redhead. 
Great set of hooters, nice round bubble butt. 
 Me and this hottie were meant to hook up. 
 Where? 
Can't remember. No, wait. 
First I'm supposed to get something. 
What? 
Package. I was waiting for 
a delivery but it never showed. 
The messenger service closed early, so I was gonna go get it myself after hours. 
Where? 
 Some place in Sector Nine. 
 Can you be a little more specific? 
I can't remember the name. 
Jam Clydesdale? Flam Pony? 
 Jam Pony? 
 Yeah, that's the one. 
Oh, my God. 
 We gotta blaze. 
 Blaze now? Before haggis? 
Max, looks like you're hangin' out with a higher class of people than usual. 
 Reagan Ronald's the name. 
 Call me Kat. 
I'm charmed. 
 Cool costume. 
 It's not a costume. It's for haggis night. 
The sp�cialit� de maison. 
I'm sorry. Allergic to cats. 
Not that you're really a cat, but just goes to show you the power of the human mind. 
I see a cat, I sneeze. 
I can't breathe in here. 
 What was that? 
 Dieter can throw his voice. 
He's a scream at parties. 
 Can you make that salt shaker talk too? 
 What a moron. 
Better keep practising. 
 We're outta here. 
 I thought people wanted haggis. 
They ran out. See ya. 
Great to meet you. 
 Be right back. 
 What are you hunting for here? 
 Be right back. 
 What are you hunting for here? 
 Ming vase. 
 Saxophone. 
You know, one of those 14th-century royal Chinese saxophones? 
Don't you wanna go with 'em? 
You remind me of my friend Chad. 
 How big's your package? 
 Let's just say I don't get any complaints. 
How'd you like me to pluck out your eyes? 
Tell me what I'm looking for. 
A package. That's all I know. 
Everybody take a pile. 
 This way, everyone. 
 It's Reagan Ronald. 
Let's go. Hurry up. Let's go! 
OK, gather round. 
Clear the way. 
I'm pleased to announce our greatest fears have been realised. 
Mutant transgenic monsters live among us. 
I surreptitiously photographed these fiends earlier on this evening. 
Unfortunately, my undercover activities force me to relinquish my post here. 
While I was out, a headless mutant broke in and stole a package. 
Surveillance video caught the entire thing. 
Is there a cat in here? 
Did someone bring a cat in here? 
The package that this headless mutant absconded with, do we know what was in it? 
No, we do not. However, 
in this vermin's haste to flee, he dropped a piece of paper which reads: "Be at the coordinates at 10pm." 
I hate cats. Vile creatures. 
I hate cats. Vile creatures. 
They're always sleepin' and lickin' themselves. 
Lovely. 
As for this headless mutant, he will not succeed in his nefarious mission. 
While I coordinate operations here at HQ, you will scour the night, you will find him, and beat him into a transgenic paste. 
But first, cake and ice cream upstairs. Yeah? 
An army marches on its stomach. 
 What a loon. 
 What does that mean, meet at 10pm? 
Got me. I told you, I was planning 
on hookin' up with that redhead. 
Where? Talk fast or the left eye goes first. 
Some bar. Munch? Crunch? Smash? Rash? 
 Crash? 
 That's the one. 
This just gets better and better. 
What are you looking for here? Waffle iron, 
ukulele, stuffed moose head, whatever. 
It's not even like that. We're playing by 
German rules. Can you get me a beer? 
Yeah. One brewski coming up. 
Look at my girl, comin' correct and takin' Joshua for a night on the town. 
That is so not what's happening. 
Hey, brown sugar, what's cookin'? 
Sweet baby Jesus! Tell me 
I did not see what I just saw. 
Hold this. I'll be right back. 
Thought you were trackin' down a hit man. 
Excuse me? 
Sorry. Have you two 
seen a headless body around? 
Back room. 
Max, just been discussing the mutant infestation with your boy here. 
Not right now, Sketch! 
 Alpha leader. Come in, alpha leader. 
 Roger. This is alpha leader. Over. 
This isn't Roger. This is Sketchy. 
"Roger" is an acknowledgment in the affirmative, not a name, moron. 
How many times have I told you? 
Say "over". Over. 
 Acknowledged. Over over. 
 No, not "over over". 
 "Over." Over. 
 That's what I just said. Over over. 
Oh, God. Never mind. 
What have you got for me? Over. 
The headless mutant transgenic male Caucasian subject just left, armed with a sniper rifle. 
The others went after him. Over over. 
Roger. Guess we know 
what was in that package he was after. 
All right, this is alpha leader. Clear. 
You forgot to say "over over". Over over. 
Nitwit. 
 Why are we chasing this guy? 
 That rifle he's got, we need it to win. 
 Other team. 
 Isn't that weird for a scavenger hunt? 
German rules. Step on it! 
What? 
We're outta gas. 
Great. Just great. 
Thanks, guys. 
OK, talk. Why's your body packin' heat? 
Seattle's a rough town. 
Maybe I wanted protection. 
A rifle as protection? Try again. 
You'll never get it out of me. 
Fine. Fine. 
 I'm in town on a mission. 
 A mission? 
For Manticore. 
Manticore's gone. Finito. Kaput. 
No more missions? 
 For any of us? 
 Your mission from now on is to lay low, which is why we can't have this idiot running around waving an assault rifle. 
Manticore or no, I take pride in my work. 
And Mr Lemkin expects the job to be done. 
Lemkin? Pierpont Lemkin? 
I can't believe I just said that. 
You're the hit man Logan talked about. 
Lemkin. Lemkin. Lumps in my Lemkin! 
Give me that. 
How can your body work without the rest of it tagging along? 
Muscle memory. 
I trained for months for this job. 
 Who's the target? 
 No way. I've said too much already. 
 Now you listen to me... 
 OK, we're good to go. 
 Change of plan. We're going to Logan's. 
 Your exboyfriend's house? 
He's not my ex-boyfriend. 
I mean, we're not like that. 
 My Girl. 
 Breakfast at Tiffany's. 
Pretty Woman. 
Little Women. 
I read that. 
Beth dies. 
 So I'm thinkin' my head is your hit man. 
 Could be. 
We still need to figure out who the victim is. 
 Good luck. 
 Zip it! 
 Tokyo Decadence. 
 Idle Hands. 
 Tokyo Decadence. 
 Idle Hands. 
 Born Free. 
 No. 
Faster, Pussycat! Kill, Kill, Kill! 
 Look at me. Look at Joshua! 
 Monty Python and the Holy Grail. 
 Bingo. 
 Found something? 
No, I got bingo. 
How is this going to help us find the target? 
Yeah. 
Good work. Thanks. 
My informant. According to him, the target 
is either a priest, a minister or a rabbi. 
 I feel like I've heard this joke before. 
 It's not a joke. A man's life is at stake. 
Father McAllister, Reverend Beckwith and Rabbi Stutz are outspoken religious leaders. 
Any of them could've tangled with Lemkin and bought this hit. 
 You can't narrow it down any more? 
 Not unless that head starts talkin'. 
Let me break it down for you, Sally. Tell me 
what you know, or you're in a world of hurt. 
 I can take anything you dish out. 
 Yeah? You ever had a swirlie? 
You ready to talk, Sally? 
Max, what are you doing? 
All right, all right! 
I'll tell ya. It's the priest - Father McAllister. 
That's a... 
Battery-operated, voice-activated animatronic head. Realistic, isn't it? 
Yeah. 
There's a perfectly simple explanation for this. 
Boo! 
I've had enough of you. 
Head... talking. 
 No body. 
 It's OK, man. 
We're all friends here. 
Wait a minute. You're not really German 
exchange students on a scavenger hunt. 
You're monsters. 
Rafer, I had a real nice time. Call me. 
OK, team, we're moving out. 
Can you keep Rafer entertained? 
 No problem. 
 Let's go. Come on, kitty. 
Logan says Father McAllister's receiving a humanitarian award on Sunday night. 
 Father? 
 Different Father. Stay with me. 
Tonight there's a run-through. Not much 
security. Perfect opportunity for a hit. 
We need to search the place top to bottom. 
Joshua, you take the basement. 
Joshua in basement. Always the plan. 
Fine, take the roof. You take the basement. 
You handle backstage. I'll do the catwalks. 
I think I might be better suited to handle the catwalks. 
How about you do what I say and we don't have a problem? 
 Catfight. 
 Let's get moving. 
We walk over to the podium where I am to accept my award. 
Well-deserved, I might add. 
I wait till the applause dies down, then I give my acceptance speech. 
And I promise you, there won't be a dry eye in the house. 
Come on, come on. 
What are you waiting for? 
 Father McAllister, over here. 
 Who's that calling my name? 
A great admirer of yours. 
How about an autograph, Your Eminence? 
Let me go! 
Just kick her ass. 
So this was some kind of drunken Halloween fraternity prank? 
Apparently so, Your Worship. 
That hooligan was intending to egg you as part of a pagan initiation ritual. 
Thank you, my children, for putting a stop to his heathen plan. 
 Don't thank her, Your Godliness. 
 Thank us. We saved you. 
Now just hold the phone. 
 I'm Eyes Only. 
 I'm supreme commandant of S1W. 
Saints preserve us. 
When you have a moment, Your Cleanliness, would you marry us? 
It would be my privilege, my son. 
There they are, constables! Do your duty! 
There they are, constables! Do your duty! 
Pardon the interruption, Your Significance, but these people are monsters. 
Max, get away. 
 Max... 
 No, he wasn't hurting anybody. 
And what do you know about it? 
Are you one of them? 
Well, answer him, Max. 
No, I'm not one of them. 
Then move along and mind your own business. 
Max... 
All I wanted was a normal night out. 
But I guess, for a girl like me, normal is just too much to ask. 
The thing is... 
Boo! 
 What are you doin' here? 
 Checkin' in on you. 
Poor Joshua's gonna spend his life in a cage. 
 I know. It's all my fault. 
 Got that right. 
Max and Joshua, outside with up-here people. 
 Wanna end up in a cage? 
 What's the worst that could happen? 
 What the hell was that? 
 Flashback. Happens all the time. 
Thought I was trippin' there. 
This whole evening's been one great big nightmare. 
But the worst part wasn't some talking head in a bag, or Nomlies eatin' haggis, or even Joshua gettin' hauled off by the po-po's. 
It was my girl denying who she really is. 
Denying the people that she loves. 
Sugar, that's the worst thing that you ever coulda done. 
That's the worst thing that coulda happened. 
But can I ask you one question? 
Where are your clothes? 
Boo. 
Hey! 
What are you gonna be for Halloween? A prune? 
I just had the weirdest dream. 
Put some clothes on. 
You're gonna be late for the party at Crash. 
And your boy Rafer is waitin' on your ass. 
Tell him I couldn't make it. 
There's something I gotta do. 
Hey, big fella. 
What ya doin'? 
Lay low. 
I've been thinkin'. 
You and me aren't like other people. We're 
different, and nothing's gonna change that. 
Joshua and Max, different. 
Yeah. Some people might even call us freaks. 
Freaks. 
Which is why we gotta stick together. 
So I'm gonna take you out. 
Even if it's just for one night. 
Come on. 
 Tricks and treats? 
 What's the worst that could happen? 
Cool costume. 
 Tony, got a second? 
 What is it? 
I think it's time I stepped down. Here you go. 
What's this? 
Access codes to CTU and Division. 
You're the new CTU director, Tony. 
Let me out of here right now. 
I know the bomb didn't go off. 
 I just wanted some company. 
 Then what are you doing out here? 
 This is where I belong. 
 I don't. 
Here. Take it. There's cougars out there. 
If you see one, fire a shot in the air and it'll take off. 
Roger Stanton confesses that he's known about the bomb for weeks. 
You have to trust me, David. Your presidency 
is in jeopardy. Let me help you. 
No. You'll leave now. 
If you resist in any way, I'll have no choice but to place you under arrest. 
 You gotta give me your badge, Kate. 
 No. I don't believe you'd shoot me. 
Where's the bomb, Marie? The real bomb? 
You can go to hell, you bastard. 
I'm not telling you anything. 
Why do you want me and my team to leave here so fast? The bomb's still here, isn't it? 
Initiate a grid search on every outbuilding at the airport, starting at the north end, headed south. 
The bomb is on site. 
I repeat: the bomb is on site. 
 It's armed. 
 How much time have we got? 
I can't tell. It could be any second. 
Let everyone know we'll be working in hangar 12. 
We're on standby here. 
Anything you need, Agent Bauer. 
Copy that. 
Right here should be fine. 
I need a relay here. 
Let me get a look at the circuit panel. 
They redirected the circuit. Bypass ready. 
 Easy, easy. 
 I got it, I got it. Go ahead. 
Let's check out that timer switch. 
Hang on. Adjust the flash cap. 
It's a little tight. Almost there. 
 Got it. How's that? 
 Wait. 
Cap it off. 
I need the bypass. 
 It worked. We're in good shape. 
 Good. 
George? What are you doing here? 
This is what killed me. 
I'd like to be here when they lay it to rest. 
Got it diffused yet? 
 Not yet. They're looking at ten minutes. 
 Is there a timer? 
 They haven't been able to read it. 
 It could detonate any minute? 
George, they've got it under control. 
There's gotta be somewhere else you'd rather be. 
I promised myself I would see this through to the end. That's what I'm gonna do. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. I'll just take something. 
Damn it. 
Just give me a minute, OK? 
 Is there a problem? 
 The trigger's tamperproofed. 
I should've seen it, but it was disguised. 
If it's dismantled or disconnected from the main casing, it'll detonate. 
Are you telling me that there is no way to disarm this bomb? 
That's what I'm telling you. 
Goodrich. 
They can't diffuse it. We'll have to fly it out. 
This airport doesn't accommodate jets, so find me the fastest reliable plane you can. 
There's a Cessna Caravan in front of hangar three. 
She's rock solid, cruises at 210. 
Get it. 
Northwest Regional? 
This is Jack Bauer. I need to speak 
with the president. It's urgent. Thank you. 
 Did you get a look at the timer? 
 Yeah. 
 How much time have we got? 
 55 minutes. 
Need a ride? 
 Where are you going? 
 Where are you trying to get to? 
 San Jose. 
 No kidding. That's right where I'm headed. 
Santa Clara, actually. 
It's just a few minutes past San Jose. 
 Know what? That's OK. I'm fine, thanks. 
 Don't be scared. 
 I'm not. 
 Then get in. 
 No point wandering around in the night. 
 I'll be fine. 
One second you need a ride, next you don't. 
I'm sorry. It's nice that you pulled over. 
It's just that... 
Get back in the car now. 
You don't know how to use that thing. 
Get back in the car and keep driving. 
Bitch! 
 Sir, when will you have a decision? 
 When will the plane be ready? 
 Ten minutes. 
 I'll get back to you before then. 
In the meantime, prepare for the two possibilities we discussed. 
 And coordinate with the FAA. 
 Yes, sir. 
I want maps and charts for both scenarios. 
Pacific Ocean here, desert here. 
We're ready to assemble. I'll get back to you 
when we have a final decision. 
Yes, sir. 
I wish I had more faith in the reliability... 
 Best you can, Mike. 
 Yes, sir. 
I'll discuss consequences of detonation in the Pacific Ocean. 
Lynne will do the same for the Mojave Desert. 
In the time available, the plane can get roughly 80 miles offshore. 
If it splashes down just before detonation, the bomb will go off underwater. 
The ocean will absorb a large portion of the radiation. 
However, prevailing winds would blow a moderate level of fallout back over the city of Los Angeles. 
Over time, there would be a high incidence of cancer and other radiation-related diseases. 
 But there'll be no immediate casualty. 
 We can't be certain. 
The shipping lanes into the port of Los Angeles are extremely busy. 
In the 80 square miles off the coast of LA, the Coast Guard counts two dozen freighters flying flags from around the world, plus an unknown number of unregistered fishing or pleasure vessels. 
It's likely that one or more of them would be sunk or capsized by the blast. 
What's the impact on the environment? 
The blast will wipe out a substantial pocket of biodiversity. 
Keystone species would be exterminated, the food chain would be contaminated, and the regional ecological infrastructure would collapse. 
Marine resources such as offshore drilling, commercial fishing, even recreational beach usage would become hazardous or impossible for many years. 
The ecological and economic effects, Mr President, would be devastating. 
 What about the desert? 
 We can designate a ground zero. 
It's isolated, so inhabited areas won't be immediately affected. 
Towns could be evacuated within hours without any serious long-term effects. 
We can't rule out the possibility of isolated campers and hikers, who would be killed or contaminated by the blast. 
If the wind shifts substantially during the next few hours, it could blow fallout over Las Vegas. 
The best meteorological projections indicate that that is a very, very slight possibility. 
Long-term effects? 
An area of a few square miles around ground zero would be highly radioactive for decades, but the truth is we don't get food or any significant resources from the desert anyway. 
So the overall health risk is relatively small. 
Sounds like the desert's our best option. 
Yes, sir, we do agree with that. 
But there is one more thing. 
In the desert, ground zero has to be a precise location. 
A depression, below sea level and surrounded by mountains, so it could hopefully contain the fallout. 
Potential target sites are being researched as we speak. 
 All right. 
 Point is, the airplane isn't a military craft. 
It doesn't have any of the equipment needed to deliver a payload accurately. 
To ensure the necessary level of precision, a pilot will have to go down with the plane. 
 It's a suicide mission. 
 Why can't we push it out the side door? 
It's too imprecise, sir. 
If the pilot is flying low enough to ensure accuracy, he would be killed by the blast. 
One man dies, Mr President, to ensure the safety of millions. 
 Jack? 
 Mr President? 
 The desert. 
 Yes, sir. 
Jack, my people tell me that the pilot has to die. 
CTU came to the same conclusion. The bomb 
has to be put down on specific coordinates. 
I'm sorry, but there isn't another way. 
Do we know who the pilot will be? 
We have a few volunteers, sir. 
All of them good men. 
Whoever it is, tell him he has the undying gratitude of every citizen of this country. 
And tell him we will take care of whatever family he leaves behind. 
 Yes, sir. I will. 
 I'll be standing by, Jack. 
 Call me back when the plane's in the air. 
 Yes, Mr President. 
Funny, I don't see any volunteers. 
When was the last time you flew a plane? 
I can get it in the air and put it down, George. 
So can I. I'm current, I'm instrument-rated, 
and I'm gonna be dead by the end of the day. 
 Problem is, you could be dead any minute. 
 I can hang on for another halfhour. 
If you blacked out and it went down before it got to the desert, a lot of people will die. 
 Come on, Jack. 
 I know what you�re trying to do. 
But I gotta say no. Agent Goodrich, 
this is Bauer. They chose the desert. 
I want you to clear air space and start immediate evacuation now. 
Gentlemen! Load this bomb. We are a go! 
 It's not rated as a priority. 
 I don't care. Just do it, all right? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Thank you. 
All right, Mr Auda. Wait here a second. 
We'll be right with you. 
 Agent Graves. 
 Tony Almeida. We've been expecting you. 
 They told you what's in the case? 
 Personal effects from Ali's safe house? 
Who's he? 
His name is Yusuf Auda. 
His government assigned him as a liaison. 
They gave us information that got us in the safe house. We couldn't refuse to bring him. 
 Do you trust him? 
 Right now? I don't trust anyone. 
Yeah. Take the case and bring it into 
that conference room around the corner. 
 OK. 
 Thank you. 
 Tony Almeida, Director of CTU. Welcome. 
 Thank you. 
Must have had some trip. 
You were 10,000 miles away this morning. 
I'm ready to get back to work. 
I understand analysis needs to be done on things seized from Syed Ali's apartment. 
Yeah. Our lab needs to do 
some preliminary work first. 
I'll have somebody get you coffee. 
I'll be with you in a moment, OK? Thank you. 
The lab is ready for decryption. 
Good. Look, I might need somebody 
to do a little handholding here. 
That man's name over there is Yusuf Auda. 
Officially, he's a visiting intelligence agent entitled to full cooperation. 
Unofficially, I don't want him to see anything he doesn't need to see. 
Make sure anybody you assign understands. 
 Sure. 
 OK. 
I'm gonna deal with this Mr Auda myself. 
If you need any help, call Jacobs. 
 Tony told you to assign someone to Auda. 
 I'm assigning myself. 
You're still not comfortable working with me, are you? 
Just do your job, Carrie. 
 So, what have we got? 
 Most of it's innocuous. There is one thing. 
This was well-concealed. 
Obviously it was of great importance to Ali. 
We tried to read it, but it's encrypted. 
We don't have that technology in the field. 
OK. I'll get our people on it right away, 
see what they can find. 
 OK. 
 Thanks. 
Sure. 
 Almeida. 
 Tony, have you found Kim yet? 
 No. We're still working on it. 
 I'm running out of time. 
I understand, but we got our hands full. 
If you could wait until the plane takes off... 
 Tony, I'm flying it. 
 What?! 
I'd like to speak with my daughter while I still got time. 
There's gotta be somebody else to fly it. 
Somebody that doesn't have a family or at least no kids. 
I didn't have time to take a census. 
I can't order anyone to do this. 
Please, Tony, you've gotta find her. 
 I'll find her. 
 Tony, one other thing. 
Yeah? 
In my apartment, there's a safe. 
Inside is my will and a letter I wrote to Kim in case something ever happened to me. 
I'll make sure she gets it, Jack. 
 Thanks. 
 I'll get back to you. 
 You all right, honey? 
 I could use a lift. 
What are you doing way out here? 
I was on a date and we parked. 
He got a little out of hand, so I got out. 
Hop in. 
Thank you. I really appreciate this. 
Where would you like to go? 
I have an aunt in San Jose. 
You were on a date, it didn't work out, so you're going to your aunt's in San Jose. 
Honey, your business is your business, but I'm not an idiot, OK? 
I know. It's just been crazy, and it's a long 
story, and I'm kind of in a little bit of trouble. 
If you have a cellphone, I actually really need to make a call. 
 To whom? 
 My father. 
with the timer on the bomb. 
Thank you. 
Good luck. 
So the plane has some automatic pilot thing? 
Actually, no. It'll have to be flown out 
to a very precise location. 
So the pilot... 
Oh, my God. Who's it gonna be? 
Jack Bauer. 
Jack! 
I'm sorry, Miss Warner, but you�re gonna have to stay here. 
Cessna 47 Fox requesting immediate takeoff. 
 47 Fox, you're clear on runway three. 
 Roger that, tower. Thank you. 
Here's your preliminary draft for your statement tomorrow. 
 Yes. Right. Thank you. 
 How's the plane doing, Mike? 
 It's at 3,000 feet and climbing. 
 Out of the city yet? 
It's too soon for that, but they'll clear the main population centres in ten minutes. 
This is a good start, but I want to go over it again. 
Call Davis. I want him to get 
Air Force One ready as soon as possible. 
Sir? 
 Do you mind if I ask where you're going? 
 Los Angeles. 
Mr President, if I may speak frankly, I'm not sure that's a good idea. 
It may be a little too "hands-on", for lack of a better term. 
The people want to feel that you�re managing events, not caught up in them. 
And, in any case, I doubt if the Secret Service will even hear of it. 
Secret Service works for me. 
I don't work for them. 
Mr President. 
Sir, I do agree with Mike. 
Once word gets out that this bomb has gone off, there's bound to be civil unrest. 
I don't think you should be associated with that. 
The whole country will be traumatised by this bomb, especially the people in Los Angeles. 
I'm gonna reassure them that everything is under control. Understood? 
Yes, sir. I'll call Davis immediately. 
Thank you. We'll leave for the airport now. 
Mike, who ended up flying the plane? 
Did you get a name? 
Yes, sir. 
Jack Bauer. 
I'd have told you sooner, but I figured you had enough on your mind already. 
Cessna 47 Fox, climb to 10,000 feet, 0-8-niner. 
Roger. 0-8-niner. 10,000 feet. 
Expect final vectors in five minutes. 
I copy. 
Agent Bauer, I've got Tony Almeida. I'm 
patching him through. Hold on one second. 
 Jack, can you hear me? 
 Yeah, I can hear you. 
We found Kim. She's on the other line. 
Thank you, Tony. Good work. 
Have you told her anything? 
No. I didn't know if you'd want me to. 
OK. 
 Put her through, will ya? 
 All right. 
 Kim? 
 Dad! Finally. Oh, my God, are you OK? 
 I'm OK, sweetheart. Are you all right? 
 Yes, I'm fine. 
Thank God. 
You've had a hell of a day, haven�t you? 
 Yeah. What's that noise? Where are you? 
 I'm in a plane. 
A plane? Why? 
There's something I've gotta tell you. It'll be 
hard to hear, so I need you to stick with me. 
We found the bomb. It was wired in a way 
that made it impossible to diffuse it. 
We needed someone to fly it over the desert, so when it exploded nobody would get killed. 
That someone turned out to be me. 
How are you getting off the plane? 
I'm not, sweetheart. 
The bomb has to be dropped in a very specific area. There was no other choice. 
I'm sorry. 
But... Dad? 
 Dad, no! No, you can't do this to me! 
 Kim. 
 There has to be somebody else! 
 I didn't have any other choice. 
 Kim, I need you to listen to me. 
 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
 Sweetheart, what are you sorry for? 
 Oh, God, everything. 
I've been so mean and so bad to you. 
Honey, anything that ever happened between us... it was never your fault. 
I love you just the way you are. I don't ever 
want you to change, you understand that? 
I love you more than anything in the world. 
Kim, can you still hear me? 
Yes. 
Honey, I want you to live your life. 
I want you to be happy. 
That's all I've ever wanted for you. 
I want you to try and grow up and be the kind of person that would have made your mom proud, OK? 
Oh, God. 
Promise me that. 
I promise. 
Honey, I've gotta start focusing on what I'm doing up here. I'm running out of time. 
I'm gonna have to say goodbye. 
I love you more than anything in the world and I will always be with you, OK? 
Remember that. 
I'm proud of you... and I love you. 
 I love you, too, sweetheart. 
 No. 
Goodbye. 
I'm sorry, honey. What do you want to do? 
 I gotta get out of here. 
 What do you mean? Why? 
I was supposed to get out of LA, but it doesn't matter any more. 
No, wait a minute. This is crazy. 
Wait. Just wait. Call someone else. 
I can't. I'm OK. I need to be alone. 
You OK? 
We found Kim. 
 Jack get a chance to say goodbye? 
 Yeah. 
So what'd you find? 
We decrypted Ali's hard drive. 
It's a recording of conversation that took place four months ago. 
Conversation between who? 
Syed Ali and high-ranking government officials from these three countries. 
What we're saying is that these three countries not only knew about the bomb, but they bought it and supplied it to Syed Ali? 
 Yeah. That's what it looks like. 
 How sure are we about this translation? 
We were rushed, it needs to be refined, but the substance of it is accurate. 
We'll need voice authentication on all four of these men. 
 I've already got people working on it. 
 Get Division involved as well. 
 Northwest Regional? 
 Tony Almeida at CTU. 
I need to speak to the president about today's terrorist attack. 
I'll transfer you. 
What is it, Mr Almeida? 
We have a recording of Syed Ali collaborating with high-ranking officials from three Middle Eastern countries in preparation for today's attack. 
 When did this come to our attention? 
 Just within the last few minutes. 
 Who else knows? 
 Our Division headquarters, sir. 
They have ties to the other agencies, which means everybody knows. 
I tagged it with a section-four security, sir. 
But I did think it was important to get going on the authentication process quickly. 
 How long will that be? 
 We should have confirmation in an hour. 
Let me ask you another question, Mr Almeida. 
Why would Syed Ali record a conversation like this in the first place? 
Half the time these people don't trust each other any more than they trust us. 
My guess is Ali wanted some ammunition to protect himself, in case any of these three countries ever turned against him. 
All right. 
Thank you, Mr Almeida. 
I'll let you get back to work. Good job. 
Please pass on my appreciation to your staff. 
 Thank you, Mr President. 
 Thank you. 
Three governments in the Middle East may be behind this bomb. 
Yes, sir. I gathered that. 
We could be at war soon, Mike. 
And once it begins... there's no guarantee 
it'll be limited to these three countries. 
I've been thinking all day about something Lincoln said during the Civil War. 
"I don't claim to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me." 
It's bad enough that someone tried to smuggle a nuclear weapon in here. 
Worse that they succeeded. 
But once this bomb actually goes off, my options will narrow very, very quickly. 
This is Cessna 47 Fox. I have just 
crossed over to the low desert. 
I'm on final line to target. 
Any change in my coordinates? 
 Negative. They're confirmed as given. 
 Copy that. Confirming autopilot 08niner. 
 Coordinates are now locked. 
 Roger. Over. 
 Don't move! 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
The service is bad enough. 
You don't have to shoot me. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 I felt like taking a ride. 
How the hell did you get on this plane? 
Wasn't that hard. 
To them, I'm still head of CTU. 
Son of a bitch. 
Brought something for ya. 
It's a parachute. 
I can see what is it, George. 
I already told you, I'm taking this plane in. 
That might have made sense back on the ground, but let's face it, Jack, the hard part's over. 
You took off, cleared the city. 
What's left but flying straight and level and taking it into a dive? 
Am I right? 
Unless of course maybe you wanna die. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You've had a death wish since Teri died. 
The way things have been going for you the past year, this probably doesn't look like such a bad idea. 
You get to go out in a blaze of glory, one of the greatest heroes of all time. 
Leave your troubles behind. 
This could be the easy way out, huh? 
You still got a life, Jack. 
You wanna be a real hero, here's what you do. 
You get back down there and you put the pieces together. 
Find a way to forgive yourself for what happened to your wife, you make things right with your daughter, and you go on serving your country. 
That'd take some real guts. 
Go on, Jack. You got 12 minutes. 
What's it gonna be? You wanna live or not? 
 You really think you can do this? 
 Yes. 
You are absolutely sure you can do this? 
Jack, I'm supposed to do this. 
You need to maintain this heading and this airspeed. 
The second the LAD reads a minute and a half, you initiate a dive at a 30-degree angle. 
 Won't that get me in early? 
 That's the point. 
You have to be certain that the bomb is already in the depression before it goes off. 
I got it. 
Thank you, George. 
Thank you. 
Get your chute on and get the hell outta here. 
 I'm staying with you as long as possible. 
 I got it together. I'm fine. 
This is not negotiable. 
I'm bailing out four minutes before impact. 
That should get me far enough away. 
This is Jack Bauer. Patch me through to CTU. 
 Yes, sir. Right away. 
 Almeida. 
Tony, this is Jack. I need you to get 
a helicopter in the air immediately. 
We got a change of plans here. I'm bailing 
out. George is taking the plane down. 
What's George doing there? 
We need authentication from three sources for each voice. 
Division has public speeches from ministers. 
See if you can get his voice on phone taps. 
Michelle. 
Send a chopper to trail Jack's plane. 
Mason got on board. Don't ask how. 
He'll take the plane the rest of the way. 
We need that chopper to pick Jack up. 
I'll explain later. 
Mr Almeida, may I know what you found on the hard drive? 
 You don't have security clearance. 
 Mr Almeida. 
I and my country have shown good faith in helping you to find Syed Ali's safe house. 
I'm asking you to do the same by giving me some idea of what's going on. 
 I'm sorry, but I can't tell you at this time. 
 You Americans. 
 We Americans what? 
 Nothing. 
Come. 
 Sir, General Bowden's here to see you. 
 Of course. Show him in. 
 Mr President. 
 General Bowden. 
I understand the bomb is over the Mojave. 
It may detonate without causing loss of life. 
 That is our hope. 
 That's wonderful news. 
 Congratulations on your achievement. 
 Thank you, General. 
Perhaps it's appropriate to begin discussing the matter of retaliation. 
 Go on. 
 Yes, sir. 
The Joint Chiefs have been assuming the bomb was the work of Second Wave. 
It appears they had the backing of three governments. 
 That's not definite yet, General. 
 No, sir. I understand that. 
But for planning purposes, we should proceed as if it is. 
I request authority to activate plans to invade the countries in question. 
Activate? There are plans 
already in existence? 
We have plans for every conceivable contingency, Mr President. 
I see. So what exactly 
do you mean by activate? 
Putting the relevant military units on alert, beginning logistical operations, coordinating sources regarding the probable level of resistance to an invasion by American forces. 
Talk of an invasion is premature. 
I agree, Mr President. 
This is in the planning stages only. 
Activate your plan. But take no steps 
to implement without my direct authorisation. 
Of course, Mr President. 
Lynne. 
We may be talking about World War III. 
OK. I'm set. 
George, is there anything you want me to take care of? 
Oddly enough, I think I got everything squared away. 
I even got to spend a little time with my son. 
I didn't even know you had one. 
 I'm glad you got to see him. 
 Yeah. Me, too. 
I don't think he was particularly, but... 
Actually, I wouldn't mind if you checked in on him. 
Of course I will. 
 It's time. 
 Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Mr President. 
At this altitude, the explosion should be visible on the eastern horizon. 
I don't know if you want to take a look. 
Three, two... 
Mr President, the soldiers that attacked us at the crash site, they were Americans. 
Their commander is a Colonel Samuels. 
Whoever attacked us had access to our flight plan. 
The only way they could have gotten that information was from the inside. 
Roger, tell me everything you know about Colonel Ron Samuels from Fort Benning. 
I don't know anything about him. 
I just spoke to Roger Stanton. He's hiding 
something from me. I'm going to arrest him. 
I wanted to warn you. 
They know about OPCOM. 
 How? 
 I told them. 
This way I get him trusting me again. 
If she would have known anything, she would have told us. Kill her. 
You don't have to kill me. 
Can you identify any words that they said? 
Salat. It means "prayer". 
I want a list of every mosque in a 15-mile radius. 
I don't know what Syed Ali looks like. 
I need you to identify him for me. 
 Start a fire. 
 You're crazy. 
Crazier than going to LA where a nuclear bomb might go off any minute? 
There's been an accident. 
We need an ambulance. 
 Somebody hacked in. 
 Who else had access to it? 
 Marie? 
 I didn't expect you to find anything. 
 Hello. 
 Marie, we have a problem. 
What is it? 
Basheer and Marko are dead. 
Omar has the van now. 
 What do you need me to do? 
 They were supposed to pick up the trigger. 
 Where is it? 
 At the place where Marko worked. 
In his locker. R & J Lumber in Burbank. 
 Is there a combination? 
 No. It requires a key. 
You must do whatever you can to gain access to this locker and bring the trigger to Omar. 
You want me to do this? 
Marie, our mission depends on you now. 
I'm counting on you. 
I'll take care of it. 
 I know you will. 
 I'll see you there. 
Marie, you should change your appearance. 
OK. 
At the mosque, all we need you to do is identify Syed Ali. 
Then we'll transfer you back to CTU. 
 You OK? 
 Yeah. 
I know how difficult this must be for you. 
Do you? 
It would really help me out a lot if you could tell me what's going on. 
I'm not at liberty to tell you any more than I already have. 
Your people took the liberty of arresting my father. 
Syed Ali took the liberty of kidnapping me and killing Paul Koplin in front of me. 
I think I've earned the right to know what's going on. 
We believe Syed Ali is at the centre of a terrorist attack that's gonna take place in Los Angeles today. 
What kind of terrorist attack? 
A nuclear bomb. 
You're the only person we know of that's ever seen him. 
We need you to identify him for us. 
The reason why I'm taking you with me now is because we're running out of time. 
 Jack Bauer. 
 It's George. 
Baker should be on site any minute. I got 
a hard perimeter set up around the mosque. 
I'll get back to you as soon as we get there, George. 
Jack, there's something I gotta talk to you about. 
The Sheriffs Department at Newhall were transporting Kim and they got into an accident. 
 What kind of accident? 
 Don't worry. She didn't get hurt. 
What the hell was she doing with them? 
Your people were supposed to pick her up. 
By the time our guys got to the station, they'd already moved her. 
I guess some local deputy was trying to be a big shot, claiming jurisdiction for a murder charge. 
Where is she now? 
She ran off after the accident. 
Maybe she was trying to avoid the local police or trying not to get brought back to LA. 
Damm it, George. You told me you would 
take care of this. You gave me your word. 
Please, please find my daughter. 
Jack, if it's any consolation, she is outside the projected blast radius. 
Just find her, George. 
What was that about? 
My daughter. 
 Is she involved in this somehow? 
 No. 
She's in some kind of trouble, though. 
I don't know yet. I hope not. 
Yes, I'll tell him. 
The consensus at Justice is that the evidence against Stanton isn't actionable. 
How much more do they need? 
We've established a direct link between him and the mercenaries that shot down Bauer's plane. 
That connection is still circumstantial. 
He's been sabotaging our efforts to find the bomb all day. 
I cannot and I will not allow him to continue heading up NSA. 
I'm only saying it's going to take time to get a judge to issue a warrant. 
 We don't have time, Mike. 
 Then don't worry about a pretext. 
Take him out of play now and we'll deal with the legal ramifications tomorrow. 
Sherry was right. 
My own people working against me. 
Stanton won't be easy to break. 
Not in the time we have. 
We may need to expand the limits of how far you've been willing to go in the past. 
What are you saying, Mike? 
That you do whatever it takes to find out what Stanton knows about this bomb. 
I'm sorry. I can't disturb them right now. 
David only found out about Stanton because of me, and it makes no sense that he's keeping me out of the loop. 
I'm not sure what you think I can do about that. 
Why don�t you just tell me what he's doing about Stanton? 
He hasn't let me in on it yet, so I don't know what's been decided. 
Can�t you find out? 
Mrs Palmer, if the president wanted input from either of us, I'm sure he'd let us know. 
Lynne, you took credit for my work on David's speech, and that was OK, I was fine with that. 
But right now my only interest is to help David get through this day. 
I assume that's your priority as well? 
I'll see what I can do. 
 Miss Warner. 
 She stays with me. 
We're good to go. I've got 30 men 
ready to move on your order. 
 How many people in the mosque? 
 100 to 125, divided into target groups of 10. 
 We're not going in, not yet. 
 Sir? 
We go in hot and it'll give Syed Ali time to take his own life before Kate can identify him. 
 What's the alternative? 
 We wait for the prayer service to end. 
He comes out, Kate identifies him, then we'll take him out surgically. 
 Fast and alive. He's no good to us dead. 
 What if someone spots us first? 
They phone Ali, we lose our surprise. 
Assuming he's even inside. 
We're working on a weak hunch. 
He might be at some other mosque. 
We're gonna have to take that chance. 
We're waiting this out. 
I could go in. See if he's inside. 
I'll wear a hijab, hide my face. 
He wouldn't see me. 
I don't feel comfortable putting you in that kind of a position. 
From what you�ve told me, we're all in a pretty bad position. 
If I could help, I'd really like the chance. 
 You really think you can do this? 
 Yeah. 
Get me the schematics to the mosque. 
I'll look at the floor plan. 
 Everything's in place, Mr President. 
 Do it. 
Let's move. 
What's going on, Mike? 
Mr Stanton, by order of the president, I'm placing you under arrest for conspiracy to commit treason against the United States of America. 
What the hell are you talking about? 
Hands off. 
I demand to speak to the president. 
I'm sure you'll get your chance, sir. Let's go. 
Come in. 
Sir, Mrs Palmer's been trying to reach you for the last half-hour. 
Yes, I know. 
She's on line seven waiting right now. 
 I can put her off if you'd like. 
 No, I'll take it. 
 Thank you. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Yes, Sherry. What is it? 
 David, thank God. 
I was just wondering what you�d decided to do about Roger. 
I'm having him questioned. 
Has he admitted to ordering Jack Bauer's plane shot down? 
Not yet. 
Then we don't know any more than we did an hour ago. 
What is your point, Sherry? 
My point is I think you should have waited for something more concrete. 
I don't run my decisions past you, Sherry, not any more. 
A large part of the intelligence you're basing your decisions on came from me. 
I think I've earned a seat at the table here. 
You're not a member of my staff. 
You're not a government employee. 
 And you're not my wife. 
 That was your decision, not mine. 
Sherry, whatever role you're playing here today is on my terms, my timetable. 
Continue doing what you�re doing. 
I'll speak to you soon. 
But... 
We need one person that we can coordinate with, not three. 
Yeah, we got that sorted out. 
You have him contact Jack Bauer. 
He's running point for us. 
Hey. 
FBI. They want a representative at the 
mosque, but they've got their wires crossed. 
Listen, what we were talking about before... 
Yeah, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have 
put you on the spot like that. 
No, actually, I'm glad you did. 
 You are? 
 Yeah. 
There's been something hanging between us since you started here. 
Yeah. Yeah, there has. 
I made a decision a while ago to try to keep personal and professional stuff separate. 
But now I... 
Michelle Dessler. 
 Tell Almeida Warner's getting agitated. 
 OK, I'll tell him. 
 There's a problem in room seven. 
 Bob Warner? 
Yeah, he's getting violent. 
Get your hands off of me! 
You can't keep me here! 
 What's going on? 
 He asked for water. 
 He bolted out the door. 
 Why can't I see my lawyer? 
Sit him down. Calm down, Mr Warner! 
I won't calm down. 
I want someone to start listening to me. 
I need you to calm down! 
Whatever Reza told you, he's lying. 
You are not helping your case here. 
You understand me? 
You wanna have a conversation, or do you want me to lock you up for the night? 
Where are my daughters? 
Marie left here five minutes after Reza was taken to your office. 
What about Kate? 
What? Has something happened to Kate? 
She's with one of our agents. 
One of your agents? Why? 
You're gonna have to trust us, Mr Warner. 
She's gonna be fine, all right? 
Trust? 
This is where the men pray, in front, closest to the entrance. 
You walk by them as you pass through here down to the women's prayer area in the back. 
You've got one shot. Once you pass them, 
their backs'll be to you. 
Get a clean look at the whole room. 
If you spot Ali, go past the women's prayer area here, up here to this fire-exit door. 
We'll disable the alarm while you're inside. 
We'll be waiting for you in the alley. 
 Are you clear? 
 Yeah. 
 Are your men in place? 
 Yeah. 
OK. Let's go. 
Kate, you sure about this? 
Yeah. 
OK. Take this. 
If Ali sees you, or you feel like you're in danger, press that. 
It'll send a distress signal to my walkie-talkie and we'll be in immediately. 
Be careful. 
She's in. 
 The prayers have already begun. 
 I'm sorry I'm late. There was traffic. 
 Have you prayed with us before? 
 Yes. 
It's been a while, though. I've been away. 
It's Jack. You're all right. 
He's in there. Syed Ali. He's in there. 
Stanton's last call was to Virginia. 
He wasn't on long enough to get a complete number, but we know it's a Langley prefix. 
CIA. 
Sergeant. 
Sit down. 
We have it all, Roger. 
You reactivated OPCOM with an eyes-only order. 
You used it to communicate with Colonel Samuels as recently as two hours ago. 
And we've connected Samuels directly to the mercenaries that tried to kill Jack Bauer. 
I don't know, Roger. It almost seems 
as if you want this bomb to go off today. 
But I'll tell you this: if people die, Roger, you'll be executed. 
And even if we find the bomb in time, you'll still get life without the possibility of parole. 
But all I want... is to find the bomb in time. 
That's why I have a deal for you. 
You tell me everything  I mean everything - and I'll bury this. 
You resign, due to health reasons. 
You'll collect your pension. 
You'll retire in a nice house, somewhere in the country. 
You'll be given a written grant of immunity. 
And nobody will ever know anything about this. 
Do we have a deal? 
I don't know what you're talking about, Mr President. 
I've done nothing wrong. 
I don't know any more about the bomb than you do. 
I want you to cover these two back exits from the alley. 
We're looking for a Middle Eastern man, late 30s. 
Black shirt, silver buttons, black pants. 
Miss Warner and I will cover the main entrance. 
As soon as the crowd starts to leave the building, she'll identify Ali. 
I'll inform Agent Baker. He will give the go. 
No one moves before that happens. 
If you fire your weapon, shoot to wound only. 
We're looking at 19 minutes before the service is over. 
Is everybody clear? 
We cannot afford any mistakes here. 
OK. Let's go. 
 There you are, sir. 
 Thank you. 
Control the focus with the centre dial here. 
What you did for us in the mosque, I thought it was really courageous. Thank you. 
You're kidding me. I'm still shaking. 
You did great. 
The prayer service lets out in 17 minutes. 
 You wanted to see me, sir? 
 Thanks for keeping this discreet. 
Of course. 
Ted, how long have you been with the Secret Service? 
Five and a half years, sir. 
I understand you have a background in Special Ops. 
Green Berets, sir. 
Unit seven out of Fort Myers, '87. 
 Ever put your training to use? 
 The Gulf, sir. 
Anywhere else? 
There were some other... covert ops. 
Under the directorate at the CIA? 
It's all right, Ted. I'm not on a witch-hunt here. 
But I do need you to answer the question. 
Yes, sir. For the CIA. 
Good. You understand 
the gravity of today's situation? 
Of course, sir. 
I guess you've heard that Roger Stanton's no longer functioning as the head of NSA. 
 I heard he was arrested. 
 He was, under my authority. 
What I'm about to ask you to do falls outside the parameters of your Secret Service charge. 
You won't be able to tell anyone about this without my direct consent. 
Are you still with me, Ted? 
What would you like me to do, sir? 
Extract information from Roger Stanton. 
I see. 
If he resists, how far am I permitted to go? 
Whatever you need to do. 
Yes, sir. 
Tony. Richards and Maccabee were shot. 
So was Reza Naiyeer. They're all dead. 
 What? 
 A janitor found their bodies. 
I just got off the phone with the LAPD. 
Are there any suspects? 
Last time I talked to Maccabee, she said that Marie Warner had just got there. 
She wanted to talk to Reza. 
Marie Warner? 
She was there during the shootings? 
Security cameras show she was the only one to leave the building in the last 40 minutes. 
 Bauer. 
 It's Tony. 
 How's it going over there? 
 We got about 10 minutes. 
 Are you still with Kate Warner? 
 Yes, I am. 
I got some information, but you need to keep this conversation one-sided. 
 Can you do that? 
 Yes. 
Richards and Maccabee have been shot and killed. So was Reza Naiyeer. 
Uh-huh. 
We have strong evidence that Marie Warner was the shooter. 
Yeah, I understand. 
Has Kate Warner been contacted by anybody in the last half-hour? 
No, she's been with me the entire time. 
Jack, I think you have to treat her as an unknown. 
For all we know, she's working with her sister. 
I don't think so. Ali's men would've 
killed her if we hadn't shown up. 
If Kate's sister's part of this, or if she's one of the terrorists, I really don't think Kate knows about it. 
Jack, that's your call. 
I just wanted to give you the information. 
OK, thanks. 
Was that your office? 
Yeah. 
 Are they still holding my dad? 
 Yes, your dad's safe. 
What about my sister? Is she OK? 
Has anyone heard from her? 
I don't think so. 
Excuse me. Bill told me 
you're the guy in charge. 
I'm the foreman. 
I need a favour. I need to get something 
out of my boyfriend's locker. 
 Your boyfriend? 
 Marko Ashami. 
 You go out with Marko? 
 I did. We got into a fight last night. 
It's a long story, but the point of it is we're not going out any more. 
 That why he didn't show up for work today? 
 I guess. 
It was a pretty bad fight. 
And he's got something in his locker that belongs to me. 
I can't go opening people's lockers. 
You'll have to work it out with Marko. 
I don't know how well you know Marko, but if I could've worked it out, I wouldn't be asking. 
Please. It's really important. 
I'm sorry. I can't. 
Can't or won't? 
I'd really show my appreciation. 
And I'd show it to you first. 
What do you mean? 
 Is this your office? 
 Yeah. 
Does it have a lock? 
Time is of the essence, Mr Stanton. 
Intensity and duration of the electrical current will increase substantially each time I repeat a question. 
Yes, I know the drill, Agent Simmons. 
What is your agenda, Mr Stanton, and who else is involved? 
Who else knew about the bomb, Mr Stanton? 
Who have you been working with? 
I don't know anything about the bomb. 
Who are you working with, Mr Stanton? 
Please, Mr Almeida, just tell me what is going on with my daughter Kate. 
 I already told you, Mr Warner. She's fine. 
 What is she doing with one of your agents? 
Reza Naiyeer is dead. 
Oh, God. 
We just found out. He and two of our agents 
were shot and killed at your office. 
What about Marie? Is she OK? 
Please tell me Marie is OK. 
Look... 
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Mr Warner, but we believe Marie committed the murders. 
It's a trick. I know it's a trick. 
You're trying to trick me. 
Here they come. 
All teams, be alert. They're coming out now. 
 Can you see him yet? 
 No. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Is that him? 
It could be the one behind those three men. 
Just take your time, Kate. Be sure. 
I can't see his face. 
No, it's not him. 
I don't see him. I don't see him! 
Keep looking. He's gotta be in the crowd. 
There's the greeter. 
Normally he'd be the last one out. 
Damm it. Anything on the back exits? 
 Negative. No one's gone in or out. 
 Damm it! 
Kate, you would tell me if you saw him, right? 
Of course I would. What do you mean? 
Why are you looking at me like that, as if I'm suspicious? I didn't see him! 
Just relax. He must have made you 
when you were inside the mosque. 
Agent Baker, he didn't come outside. 
Give the word to go. Secure the building. 
Open the gate. 
Go! Go! 
 What's going on? 
 Federal agent. I've got a warrant. 
 I am the imam here. What's going on? 
 Calm down, sir. We're federal agents. 
We received positive identification of an international terrorist here. 
 We need to find him now. 
 Do you have a search warrant? 
Yes, I do, sir. 
Get back here. Keep her against the wall. 
 Can you see anything? 
 Clear. 
Damm it! 
Put the blanket on him! 
The clothes match the description. 
Teams A and B maintain positions. 
We've got Ali. 
 He's dead, Jack. 
 Son of a bitch! 
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
 CTU. 
 This is Jack Bauer. Get Mason on the line. 
Ali has killed himself. 
I'm gonna have to get back to you. 
These clothes don't belong to this man. 
Look at the pants. 
They're three inches too short. 
Maintain secure exits. Ali is still in the 
building. Repeat: Ali is still in the building. 
There's no chance that this bomb is ever gonna go off with a Special Ops team following it every step of the way. 
Jack Bauer found the Coral Snake commandos. 
All six members of the team had been killed. 
If there's something that you haven't told me... 
Ask Sherry. 
She's the one you wanna talk to. 
My father works for the government. 
He said someone's gonna detonate a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles today. 
 I'm gonna show you something. 
 What is it? 
It's a bomb shelter. 
 It happened. 
 The bomb went off? 
The radiation. We gotta get 
down below, before it's too late. 
 Hello? 
 There has been a change of plans. 
Why? What's going on? 
Marie, our mission depends on you now. 
I'm counting on you. 
They're a rogue unit, acting on their own authority. 
 How do I find them? 
 Somewhere at the airport. 
Our best bet is still you getting past them to the bomb. 
There is a nuclear warhead somewhere on-site. 
There it is! Go, go! 
Put your hands above your head! 
Keep 'em there! 
This isn't a bomb. 
It's been rigged to look like one. 
This is not the bomb. This is a decoy. 
I repeat: we are still looking for the nuclear device. 
OK, let's go easy with this. 
Go. 
You have to process the prints here. 
Bring in your mobile equipment. 
You! Where's the real bomb? 
Where's the real bomb? 
Do you understand me? 
Do you speak any English? 
Do you speak any English? 
 Search him. I'll get us a translator. 
 Yes, sir. 
This is Jack Bauer requesting a translator in hangar 21. 
I repeat: I am requesting a translator in hangar 21. 
Mr Mason, Jack Bauer is on line two. 
Good. 
 George. 
 How's the search going over there, Jack? 
Still no new leads on where the bomb is. 
What about that plane you found the decoy in? 
It's clean. Use reverse-time satellite to 
trace the plane to its original location. 
That's where they would've loaded the decoy. Find out who the players are. 
Here and here. 
George? You with me? 
George, can you hear me? 
Are you all right? 
 Yeah. 
 George! 
Yeah, I'm on it! Reverse-time satellite. Yeah. 
I'm really sorry about everything that's happened to you today. 
But if you can't think clearly, you need to let someone else take over command. 
 There isn't anybody else, Jack. 
 What about Tony? 
I got it together. I can handle it. All right? 
Yeah, OK. 
 We do have another problem. 
 What? 
The six dead commandos you found, turns out a seventh may have escaped. 
I examined all the gunshot wounds. 
Three of the commandos knew the shooter  their wounds were at close range. 
The others showed signs of a struggle, which indicates they had time to react. 
 So the seventh didn't escape. 
 Right. He was a shooter. 
I gotta go. Get me an ID on the seventh 
commando as soon as you can. 
 I'm working on it. 
 Good. 
 What do you got? 
 A wallet, no ID, no credit cards. 
He wants to talk. 
Where the hell is my translator? 
Mr Warner, it's your daughter Kate. 
 Kate? 
 Dad? 
 Kate, where are you? 
 I'm fine. I'm at an airport. 
The airport? Are you leaving the city? 
Not yet. I'm helping one of 
the agents on an investigation. 
Dad... did they tell you about Reza? 
Yeah, I... I can't believe 
what they're saying about Marie, that she's with these terrorists, that she killed Reza. I... 
I know, Dad. 
 Kate... 
 Dad, hold on a second. 
It wasn't the bomb. We arrested the pilot. 
I need you as a translator. 
Dad, I'm gonna have to call you back. 
Are you OK? 
Yeah, I'm fine. Dad, I love you. 
I love you, too, sweetheart. 
 What exactly did Roger Stanton tell you? 
 Sherry was somehow involved in this. 
 The nuclear threat? 
 He didn't elaborate. 
That's all he said. 
They said it was urgent. 
Is it about the bomb? Have they found it? 
Not yet. Sit down. 
I just spoke with Stanton. He confesses 
that he's known about the bomb for weeks. 
For weeks? Why would he 
withhold that from you? 
He wanted to wait until the bomb was on US soil before he intercepted it. 
 So he knows where the bomb is. 
 The men he had tracking it did. 
But they're all dead. The bomb's still 
out there, and we don't know where it is. 
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
Am I telling you something you already know? 
 What? 
 Tell me now. 
Have you done the unthinkable and put yourself in league with Roger Stanton? 
That's outrageous! Of course not! 
What did he say? 
Sit down. 
 David... 
 Sit down! 
He said you were involved, working against me. 
He's lying, David! I never even met 
Roger Stanton until this afternoon! 
 That's not true. 
 He's playing you! 
Whatever he's doing, he wants you to believe I... 
Just stop it! 
Sherry... right now we are 
teetering on the brink of a war that will lead to the deaths of millions of people. 
We have to stop this disaster today, right now, before it begins. 
If there is something you're not telling me, anything that could help us find this bomb, as President of the United States, I order you... 
No, as someone that you claim you love... 
I'm asking: help me, Sherry. 
I got a phone call... a few months ago 
in the middle of the night from a friend of mine who's high up in NSA. 
He told me that Roger Stanton wanted to speak to me first thing in the morning, and so we met at a park in Virginia. 
What did he want? 
 He wanted to recruit me. 
 To do what? 
He wanted to know who was loyal to you and who could be turned. 
He wanted... He wanted to 
know where you were weak. 
And you told him? 
Yes. 
But I only did it to gain his confidence. 
I was not aligning myself with him. 
I was doing it for you. 
David, I know you don't believe me, but just give me 30 minutes to prove to you that I'm telling the truth, that I did all of this to protect you, not to hurt you. 
I think he's saying he did it for his family. 
They promised him money. 
Ask him who "they" is. 
Syed Ali. 
Ask him if he knows about a second bomb. 
Eh? 
I don't think that was right. 
I think we have different dialects. 
It doesn't matter. Just keep trying. 
Jack, the translator's here. 
Jack Bauer. 
The subject's there. Kate? 
 I'm really sorry, Jack. 
 You did great. You did great. 
Agent Baker will take you back to the controlled area. I'll be there soon. 
Ask him if he knows about a second bomb. 
He said he doesn't know anything. 
ID, please. Can I see your ID? 
Who are those people over there? 
They're locking down the airport, checking everyone. Excuse me for one second. 
Ask him where he went to school and the name of his sponsor. 
I can't believe the bomb went off. 
What did you hear? How many people? 
I don't know. 
The transmission just went dead. 
Are you gonna be OK? 
My dad, I need to get in touch with my dad. 
We will. But for right now, we have 
to stay down here, where it's safe. 
We have no idea which way that radiation cloud is gonna travel. 
I'll see if I can pick something up on the short-wave radio, OK? 
...LA's favourite all-talk radio 
all the time, 24-7. 
The school voucher debate is really beginning to heat up again here... 
What did they say? 
The radiation is interfering with the antenna. 
It could be hours before we're able to pick up anything. 
What's gonna happen to us? 
 Shh, it's OK. 
 I'm scared. 
Don't be scared. 
You got nothing to be scared of. 
We're safe down here. I promise. 
You must be the new assistant Division sent. 
Carrie Turner. You must be George Mason. 
Excuse me... 
You look worse than I expected. 
 Is there something I can help you with? 
 No, I'm set. 
I've been following everything from Division. 
I'll be taking over from Paula, so if there's anything you need the server to do, I'll make it happen. 
Good. The situation reports 
have changed in the past hour, so you have to refresh all the computer monitors. 
No problem. Just make sure everyone 
keeps their hands off my system. 
OK. 
Mr Mason... who do I report to... directly? 
You report to me. 
No offence, Mr Mason, but rumour has it you're not gonna be around much longer. 
So... who do I report to? 
I finally get someone around here who I like, and I'm not gonna be around to enjoy it. 
Tony Almeida. 
And Michelle D-Dessler. 
 Did you say Michelle Dessler? 
 Yes, I did. Why? 
We worked together at District. 
I was her boss then. 
And you're telling me this why? 
It'll be fine. It's not important. 
Mr Mason? 
My God. Mr Mason? Mr Mason! 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Picture ID? 
 Thank you for your cooperation. 
We will try to get you out of here as quickly as we can. 
Arms straight out. 
Just stand perfectly still. 
Prepare to give the scanners any metal objects in your pockets beforehand. 
It will speed the process through the line. 
 Marie! 
 No need to be concerned. 
Please just cooperate. We appreciate it. 
 Whoa, excuse me. You can't go there. 
 What? 
Everyone is searched before they're let go. 
 It's my sister. It's important. 
 Sorry. 
Wait, here. I'm with Jack Bauer, CTU. 
 OK. Go on. 
 Thanks. 
Could you get in touch with Jack Bauer? 
Tell him Marie Warner is here. 
He'll understand. 
Dispatch, we need to locate a Jack Bauer with CTU. 
Copy that. 
 Marie. 
 I need your badge, Kate. 
Where've you been? 
 Give me your badge. 
 Marie... 
Shut up. You stupid idiot. 
Why did you have to start snooping around? 
What's going on? 
You have always treated me like I was some helpless injured animal. 
Like I couldn't get by without you looking over me. 
What happened to you? 
I opened my eyes. 
That's what happened to me. 
I was pathetic, just like you. 
Until I met Syed. 
Until I saw the lies and hypocrisy of my life, of this country, of people like Dad, who help the government. He works for the CIA. 
I know. So what? 
So what? Do you have any idea the 
suffering they cause around the world? 
Oh, please. What are you, six years old? 
You think Dad is the enemy now? 
I can't believe how ungrateful you are. 
I should be grateful? 
Yeah, absolutely. Dad and I turned our lives 
upside down for you after Mom died. 
This is what we did it for? So you could 
be brainwashed by some lunatic? 
Wake up! You're about to become 
the biggest murderer in American history! 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Give me your badge. 
No. 
Fine. 
Marie, listen to me. 
There's a nuclear bomb in the city. 
No matter what you believe, you don't want all those innocent people to die. 
Give me the badge. 
No. I don't believe you'd shoot me. 
I will... because this is 
more important than your life. 
Or my life. 
Kate, stay down! 
 Stay down! 
 My arm! 
Secure the weapon! 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
I take it that's your sister. 
At least give her something for the pain. 
 I will when she tells us what she knows. 
 You can't let her suffer. 
You're gonna have to let me do this my way. You have to trust me. 
I know you love her. 
But I have to worry about the millions of lives at stake. 
She is the only person who knows where this bomb is. 
I need to use every advantage I've got to find it and stop it. 
Surely you understand that. 
Just let me do this. 
Give me your arm. 
Where's the bomb, Marie? The real bomb. 
You can go to hell, you bastard. 
I'm not telling you anything. 
You wanna know why the pain's so severe? 
The bullet's still in your arm, lodged against the bone. 
Tell me where the bomb is, and I'll get you something for the pain and treat your arm. 
Please, Marie, just talk to me. 
Just talk to me. Tell me where the bomb is. 
No! 
I know you think what you�re doing now will further your cause. 
Deep down, I don't think you wanna go through with it. 
I don't think you can justify killing millions of innocent civilians. 
Nobody's innocent in this country. 
I'm not afraid to die. 
I don't believe you. I've seen 
people who are willing to die. 
I've looked them straight in the eye, just like right now. 
You're not one of them. 
I wanna give you a painkiller, but you must help me first. 
Please tell me where the bomb is. 
Where's the bomb? 
I'm gonna check the radio. 
Do you have any sugar? 
Yeah, yeah, it's in the back corner, on the shelf there. 
Is the TV hooked up to the same antenna? 
Everyone can take out their golf clubs... 
...delivery is... Swung on. 
...prominent civic leaders 
and Hollywood stars... 
...record numbers today gathered at beaches 
to celebrate the beautiful weather of California, which will continue throughout the weekend. 
Still nothing. 
 This is our man? 
 Yeah. 
Seventh commando. 
Captain Jonathan Wallace. 
Led a sniper unit in the Gulf War, led an assassination detail in Malaysia. 
 Have you got this to Jack? 
 I'm on it. 
Start up a shared volume with OC on this guy. 
Hello, Michelle. 
 Carrie, what are you doing here? 
 Division sent me over to replace Paula. 
Right. Do you need help getting into any 
of the locked volumes on the network? 
No, actually. I'm all up and running. 
You look great, by the way. 
 Stop it, Carrie. 
 Stop what? 
You're not my boss today, all right? 
If you're here to replace Paula, then technically you work for me. 
Fine. Give me an order. 
There's a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles. 
We've been charged with finding it. 
So why don�t you start by analysing these? 
Fine. 
 Tony, do you have a second? 
 Sure. 
What is it? 
I think it's time I step down. 
I'm not feeling so hot here. 
 Is there anything I can do? 
 Actually, yeah. 
Tomorrow, when this is all over, say goodbye to everybody for me and let them know what an honour it was working with them and what a great job I think they all did, everybody. 
Sure. 
This morning when I told you I couldn't wait to get out of here... 
I don't feel that way any more. 
 Here you go. 
 What's this? 
Access codes for the CTU and Division. 
I can't take this, George. Only the CTU 
director is allowed that kind of access. 
You're the new CTU director, Tony. 
You can't promote me, George. 
Only Chappelle can do that. 
I just talked to Chappelle. 
You're the new guy. 
Listen, George... I'm sorry, I... 
Hey, don't. 
Good luck. 
I'll be operating from up here, so I'll need my access codes piped into the system. 
Got it. Everyone's ready. 
Good. Thanks. 
In case you haven't heard, George Mason was exposed to a lethal dose of plutonium this morning. 
I'm afraid he hasn't got much time. 
He just left the office and won't come back, which means that I'll be in charge until further notice. 
Now, on a normal day, we'd be mourning George, just like we would've mourned Ivers and Clark and Paula and the rest of our co-workers who were killed here today. 
Unfortunately, we have to hold our thoughts of them until we can get through this present crisis. 
So... let's get back to work. 
Tony. 
 It was a nice thing you just did. 
 What's going on at the airfield? 
Jack's still interrogating Marie Warner. 
We don't have anything new. 
 All right. Keep me posted. 
 Sure. 
Stay with me, Marie. Stay with me. 
Steve, walk with me. 
Get her Demerol for the pain. 
She's going into shock. I need her lucid. 
 For how long? 
 Five minutes should do it. 
 Kate. 
 Yeah. 
 What did she say? 
 She hasn't said anything yet. 
 I'm gonna need your help. 
 Help? How? 
You're her sister. 
I need you to bring her back to reality. 
You know her like that. I don't. 
I thought I did. She's a different person 
from the Marie I knew this morning. 
No, Kate. She's the same girl 
you grew up with. 
She's just regurgitating everything Syed Ali taught her. 
I need you to remind her of the things she used to love. 
You can do this, Kate. You can get to her. 
All right. 
She's going to be a little groggy because of the painkiller, OK? 
You all right? 
Yeah. 
Hey, Marie. 
Hi, Kate. 
Get away. I don't need you. 
 Why won�t you help us? 
 I am gonna help you. 
I'm gonna help you stop being a part of the problem. 
So it's OK with you if Dad and I died today? 
I killed Reza. And I loved him. 
Why would I care about you and Dad? 
Because we care for you. 
Because we love you. 
Why are you doing this? 
Marie, you could save everyone. 
You could stop this terrible thing from happening. 
I don't want to. I can't. 
Marie, I'm begging you. Please. 
No. 
My arm... God! 
Kate, I need you to step back. 
That's the Demerol wearing off. Tell me 
where the bomb is, and I'll get you more. 
Please tell me where the bomb is. 
Marie, just tell him, please. 
 Where is the bomb? 
 Give her something for the pain. 
No, no. 
Marie, please. Tell me where the bomb is. 
Where is the bomb? 
 Katie, make him stop! 
 No, Marie. 
You make him stop. 
The pain will get worse. 
Just tell me where the bomb is. 
It's all right. Just tell me where the bomb is. 
In the suitcase. 
Where's the suitcase? 
 In the van. 
 What van? 
Where was the van headed? 
 Downtown. 
 Where downtown? 
At the Arco Towers. 
What kind of van was it? 
What colour? What make? 
Uh... green. I don't know what make. 
We're looking for a green van. 
The nuke may be inside. 
 Send a team down to the Arco. 
 When is the bomb set to go off? 
 Three hours. 
 How do you know that? 
 I saw the timer. 
 Describe it. 
 What? 
 The timer. Describe it. 
I don't... 
You're lying to me. A bomb that size 
wouldn't have a visual timer. 
I'm not lying. It's at the Arco Towers. 
Send them all downtown now. 
Why now? What's the hurry? I thought I had 
three hours. You told me I had three hours. 
No, I'm not lying! 
Why do you want me and my team to leave here so fast? 
The bomb's still here, isn't it, Marie? 
No. 
Yes, it is. 
Teams A and B, do a grid search on every outbuilding at the airport, starting north, heading south. 
The bomb is on-site. 
I repeat: the bomb is on-site. 
Oh, Marie. 
They're not gonna find it in time. 
We're all gonna die. 
I'll sleep on the floor. You can have my bed. 
Mr President, your call's ready. 
Steve Hillenburg at Langley. 
Yes, a CIA operative. 
He's on an isolated feed. 
Nobody else knows about this but the three of you. 
 Sherry's waiting. 
 Good. Thanks. 
 Hello, Steve. 
 Mr President. 
What's your involvement in this? 
I got a call from Sherry about four months ago. 
She told me Roger Stanton was trying to recruit her in an effort to undermine your presidency. 
She wanted an independent source to confirm that she was doing it to help you. 
So you've been building a case against Stanton for the last four months without my knowledge. 
Plausible deniability, sir. 
What we were doing was illegal, but... we felt it was necessary. 
It could've backfired and landed Sherry and me in prison. 
We didn't want this to touch you if that happened. 
OK, let's say I accept that. 
What proof do you have that exonerates Sherry? 
I have photographs, taped conversations, debriefs, files filled with the work Sherry did. 
These meetings that Sherry and Roger had, where'd they take place? 
Sherry? 
Um... 
For the first month, we met at a hotel in Hilton Head. 
 I didn't sleep with him. 
 I didn't ask. 
Thank you. I'll contact you 
if I need anything else. 
Thank you, sir. 
You know, I don't care what you think of me right now. 
The most important thing is that you realise that I never, and I mean never, was a part of Stanton's conspiracy. 
You know what, Sherry? 
You might be telling me the truth. 
Then again, you might not. 
Right now, I don't have the time or energy to figure out whether I can trust you. 
You have to trust me, David. 
Your presidency is in jeopardy and so is this country. Let me help you. 
No. You'll leave now. 
David... you need me. 
If you resist in any way, I'll have no choice but to place you under arrest. 
 Yes, sir? 
 Please escort Mrs Palmer to her car. 
We got a ventilation system in here and an air supply, but it still stays cold. 
But don't worry because we got tons of blankets. 
 You tired? 
 I'm OK. 
You're still worried about your family, aren�t you? 
Try not to think about them too much. 
You're probably right. 
 So, did you grow up in LA? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, yeah? Me too. What part? 
 We moved around a lot. 
My foot is still hurting. 
Do you have any aspirin? 
Yeah, yeah, sure. I got tons. 
You're gonna let me out of here right now. 
I know the bomb didn't go off. 
 Kim... 
 Stay away! 
OK, it's OK. Just calm down. 
 I wasn't gonna hurt you. 
 Then let me go! 
 I just wanted some company, that's all. 
 Then what are you doing out here? 
This is where I belong. 
I don't. 
 I want you to stay. 
 I don't wanna stay. 
Why not? 
What's wrong with me? 
I'm not good enough? 
 It has nothing to do with you. 
 Then why? 
You think I'm psycho? 
I don't know if you're psycho. 
I don't even know you. 
Wouldn�t you rather be with someone who wants to be here? 
You don't even wanna get to know me? 
Please let me out of here, Lonnie. 
Please. 
 Here. 
 What? 
Take it. 
There's cougars out there. If you see one, 
fire a shot in the air and they'll take off. 
Turn right out the front door. 
About 200 yards away, you'll see a deer trail. 
That'll lead you to the highway. 
Thank you. 
Kim? 
Maybe you'll come back sometime? 
I don't think so. 
Goodrich, what's going on? 
All agents, one hostile down! 
Go, go, go! 
Over here! 
Let's go! Bring 'em in! 
 What do we got? 
 It's nuclear. 
And there's the trigger. This is it. 
This is Jack Bauer. We found the bomb. 
Initiate a level-one local evac now. 
 It's armed. 
 How much time have we got? 
I can't tell. Could be any second. 
Tell me about Ron Wieland. 
 He's going public with the rumour. 
 About the bomb? 
We're holding him at the OC. 
When the crisis passes I'll let him go. 
You better come out here. 
What I find most troubling is that our president knows about this threat and is saying nothing. 
 Who was controlling that room? 
 Armus. 
I want to see him now. 
Kim, I'm scared! 
Where are you taking her? 
She can't go back to LA. 
I checked you out. 
Your father does work for CTU. 
Now you tell me, what did he tell you was gonna happen today in LA? 
It's a nuclear bomb. 
What's my father's connection to all this? 
He wrote a cheque to Syed Ali for $475,000 in return for consulting services. 
Maybe they were doing business. 
Syed Ali's only business is bankrolling terrorists. 
I�m a consultant for the CIA. 
Let's go! 
Nina, how big is the bomb? 
What did he tell you? 
 Everything. 
 No! 
We're losing him! 
 Jack... 
 Secure her! 
I know where the bomb is. 
I was illegally detained inside the president's retreat for the last six hours. 
That tells you how much he did not want this information come out. 
No, Karen. 
 That does me no good. 
 What am I looking for? 
Wieland has a source inside of this administration, and I need to know who. 
 I�m on it. 
 Fine. 
Then you get back to me with that. OK. 
No, I need the information. Good. 
 What's going on? 
 You tell me. 
 What does that mean? 
 Wieland's been contained for six hours. 
After you met with him, someone let him out. 
And you think it was me? 
Even if I had the resources, which I don't, why in God's name would I want to see Wieland cause a panic, especially today? 
 I don't know. 
 David, I had nothing to do with this. 
I swear on the lives of our children! 
Mr President... 
Wait here. 
You find Armus yet? 
I wanna know how Wieland got past him. 
Take a look. 
What's this? 
A digital playback from the surveillance feeds at OC. 
That's Armus. 
This happened 25 minutes ago. 
 Armus let him out? 
 Yeah. 
 Where is he? 
 We haven't found him. 
Mr President, if Armus is working covertly against you... 
It�s not covert now! It�s in my face! 
 We will find him, sir. 
 We'd better. 
Because whomever he's working for is trying to keep me from finding this bomb! 
 How long till we go down? 
 Any minute. 
The pilots found us a place to crash land. 
I've gotta get the coordinates to George. 
 George? 
 Jack, what's happening? 
We're going down. 
The pilots don't know what's going on. 
It felt like some kind of explosion. 
We're losing all kinds of power. 
They think they can make a safe crash landing on a soft riverbed located in sector J. 
The coordinates are 34-30-44 north, 119-0-niner-0-5 west. 
 Did you get that? 
 Yeah, we got it. 
Nina, there's a chance we're not gonna make it through this. 
We need to know the location of the bomb now! 
We've given you everything you've asked for! Please! 
Can she hear me? 
Hold on, I'll put you on speaker. 
Nina, you got your pardon from the president. What more do you want? 
Even if I survive this, Jack's gonna kill me. 
 Phillips is there to protect you. 
 He can't protect me from Jack! 
Nina, all I want is the location of the bomb. 
I give you my word, I will not harm you in any way! 
I don't believe you! 
 Where is the bomb? 
 Rick, holster your weapon! 
 Do one last good thing with your life! 
 Phillips, what is going on? 
Phillips, that's an order! Take your seat! 
This is the captain. We're not 
going to make it to the riverbed. 
Everyone assume crash position and get ready for impact. 
George, we're going down! 
We're not gonna make the riverbed. 
The coordinates I gave you, they're going to be off... 
Get the crash-site coordinates from ATC and send in search and rescue. 
ATC, this is CTU. 
I need the exact coordinates. 
I'll prepare a statement in the next hour. 
In the meantime, let's find Armus. 
Yes, sir. 
Sherry... I owe you an apology. 
Why? What did Mike say to you? 
Richard Armus was the one who let Wieland go. 
But Armus doesn't have his own agenda. 
He must be working for someone else. 
We're looking into it now. 
I�m sorry I jumped to the wrong conclusion. 
It's all right. 
I don't expect you to change your attitude towards me overnight. 
Apology accepted. 
David... 
What are you gonna do? 
Talk to the press. 
I�m not sure how, but I may have to go after Ron's credibility. 
 Ron's credibility? 
 Yes. 
Make it look like his report was motivated by personal dislike, that it's not based in fact. 
Yes, but it is based in fact. 
 Believe me, I wish there was another way. 
 Maybe there is. 
Why don't you just tell the truth, David? 
It's what you do best. 
I mean, you pulled it off with Keith, with our divorce. 
You've earned the public's trust. Just use it. 
What? 
I'm just wondering if you've really changed, or if you've just gotten better at pretending. 
 Sir? 
 Yes, what is it? 
We just got word from CTU in Los Angeles. 
The plane Jack Bauer was returning in just went down. 
It crashed? 
We're still waiting for details. 
Oh, my God! 
Rick. Rick! 
Rick! 
Myers... 
I haven't found her. 
I don't even know if she made it. 
Find her... 
I'm gonna find her. You gotta hang in there. 
Hang in there. Search and rescue 
will be here any minute. 
Just hang in there. I'll be right back. 
Come on, come on. 
These images were taken around the time the pilot reported the explosion. 
 They were shot down. 
 By some kind of groundtoair missile. 
Compile a list of anybody that might have had access to their flight plan. 
If Nina didn't die in the crash, whoever it was will want to finish the job. 
I have search and rescue scrambling now. 
Make sure they're well armed. 
Get me their ETA as soon as you have it. 
George, Richards told me you had Warner and Naiyeer transferred to room seven. 
 That's right. 
 I separated them for a reason. 
It's not working, so let's put them together and play them off each other. 
One minute you're trying to save your own ass, then you act like you give a damn about anybody... 
 Back off! 
 No, I'm not gonna back off. 
Not today. Now, what's going on? 
Remember the warehouse in Panorama City? 
Weapons-grade plutonium, airborne in the fire fight. 
 You were exposed? 
 Yeah. 
Said I'd be lucky if I made it through tomorrow. 
I don't know what to say, George. 
I'm sorry. 
Me too. 
Does anybody else know about this? 
Just Jack. You. Can we keep it that way? 
Do you need anything? 
Is there something I can do? 
Just do you job. Let me do mine. 
So you both claim not to know Syed Ali. 
 It's not a claim. It's the truth. 
 Sit down. 
 I'd rather stand. 
 Sit down! 
Where the hell do you think you are? 
Wake up! 
A cache of weapons-grade plutonium was found in a warehouse in Panorama City! 
A nuclear weapon was assembled there and it's set to be detonated today. 
A nuclear bomb? 
We also found this in the warehouse. 
What do you make of that, guys? 
This is a bill of lading from our company. 
For a container sent to Syed Ali, which means at least one of you is lying right now. 
I'll let you two work that out between yourselves. 
Whoever talks first gets immunity. 
It's a one-time offer. 
It expires in ten minutes. 
 They're gonna come for us soon. 
 What's taking them so long? 
I don't know, but they'll be here. 
 We're leaving soon. 
 Where are we going? 
 Central booking. 
 LAPD? That's downtown. 
 I know where it is. 
 Aw, man. 
What did I tell you? I don't believe this. 
Someone from CTU is supposed to pick us up. Can you call George Mason? 
Captain says it's out of their jurisdiction. 
Look, you're both suspects in a capital crime. 
 We told you why we can't go back to LA. 
 The bomb. 
 Yes. 
 I checked it. 
There's been no departmental alert or elevated threat status. 
They do not want the entire city to panic at once. 
Do you think we're making this up? 
Call CTU. They'll tell you. 
I'm a cop. I have my orders, OK? 
I'll sign you two out before I take you back to the city. 
 I don't believe this. We can't go back to LA. 
 When my dad finds out, he'll fix things. 
We shouldn't be counting on your father. 
No offence, but you were right when you said how messed up he is. 
Everything I've said about my father is because I was angry and I blamed him for what happened to my mom. 
 Maybe you were right. 
 No. 
No, listen, it wasn't his fault, and he did the best he could. 
It just all turned out wrong. 
No, this is crazy. 
How can they keep us here without letting us see a lawyer? 
Huh? 
 What are we gonna do? 
 Nothing. 
Because nothing we say will make any difference. 
They'll make it look like we're involved. 
With a nuclear bomb? I've done nothing 
wrong! This is crazy! I have nothing to hide! 
 What about you, Bob? 
 What about me? 
 You got anything to hide? 
 Of course not. No. 
You made the authorisation to Ali. 
 No, I didn't. 
 Then who did? 
Don't interrogate me. 
That's exactly what they want. 
Yeah? I'm not asking for them. 
lf you didn't make the authorisation... 
Naiyeer's levels are even. 
Warner's spiking all over. 
They also said... 
that you work for the CIA. 
I let the CIA pass information through our distribution network a couple of times. 
 That's it. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 Because it is none of your concern! 
 I think it concerns me now! 
I think a nuclear bomb pretty much concerns everyone! Don't you? 
You know what I'm thinking, Bob? 
I'm thinking that all your generosity and acceptance is just a load of crap. 
Reza, you better sit down and shut up before you say something you will regret for the rest of your life. 
You lied to me. 
I can track the shipping order! 
Bob's code signature will show that he authorised the transaction order! 
 Get off of me. 
 No, just stop it. 
The database is at the office. 
I'll take you there. 
Step outside. 
 I'm not taking the fall for you, Bob. 
 Come on. Take it easy. 
All right, all right. 
 Hey, where's George? 
 With Naiyeer. He broke. 
Could you tell him the search and rescue is about 12 minutes from the crash site? 
OK. 
 Tony. 
 Yeah? 
 What's going on with George? 
 As far as what? 
He's sick, isn't he? 
He's got some kind of radiation poisoning, doesn't he? 
Where'd you get that? 
Hazmat's all over the warehouse he raided this morning, so it's gotta be hot. 
His nose was bleeding, and Shipler told me he was throwing up in the bathroom. 
And it doesn't take a doctor to figure it out. 
Besides, I can read your face pretty well by now. 
Look, he doesn't want anybody else to know, OK? 
 How bad? 
 Pretty bad. 
Can he run things in his condition. 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 That's not good enough. 
lf he's compromised mentally or physically, we can't... 
He can do his job, Michelle. 
He wants to do his job like I've never seen. 
He's determined to stop this bomb. 
So am l, which is why I think he should step down. 
I'll keep an eye on him. And the second he 
misses a step, I'll make sure he backs off. 
 No, you can't babysit him. 
 I'm not babysitting him, Michelle. 
Now, you gotta trust me on this. 
Can I see that information as soon as you get it? 
I made some notes on David's speech. 
I thought maybe you might want to incorporate them. 
I haven't even shown that to the president yet. 
 Jenny showed me a draft. 
 She shouldn't have. 
She's known me for a long time, Lynne. 
She knows what I have to offer. 
Mrs Palmer, the president believes that you can be an asset to him during this time of crisis. 
That's why you're here. He did not give you 
licence to insinuate yourself into... 
Wait, wait, wait. 
Put your back down, Lynne. 
I am not here to trespass on your territory. 
I am here to help. 
That's why I'm coming to you first before I go directly to David. 
Mrs Palmer, that sounds like a threat to me. 
Unless David's speech is pitch-perfect, which it is not, Wieland's allegations might bring down this presidency. 
I don't need you to tell me how important this is. 
Then you owe it to David to look at my revisions. 
Give me your hand. 
Come on. 
We got a survivor here. 
This doesn't look like search and rescue. 
 Who are they? Are they coming for you? 
 I don't know! 
Don't even think about it! Keep going! 
Go, go! 
Keep going! Keep going! 
Take cover in the creek bed. 
There's too many of them for me to handle. 
I need your help. Give me your hands. 
I need you to run recon for me and handle the ammunition. 
You screw with me now, and we both die. 
Do you understand? 
Jack, we need to get to higher ground so I can spot for you. 
Take the ammunition. Go. Go! 
Would you like some water, Kate? 
Maybe some tea? 
 How do you know my name? 
 I know more than that. 
I know you are 29 years old, unmarried. 
I know you have an economics degree from Stanford. 
Who are you? 
My name is Syed Ali. 
You know who I am? 
I've heard your name mentioned. 
What else have you heard about me? 
Nothing. 
Kate, what have you found in your father's files? 
You were looking in places you do not belong. You must have seen some things. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Really? 
Let go of me! Let go of me! 
I told you, I don't know what you are talking about. You got the wrong guy. 
Paul? Oh, my God. What are you doing? 
He tells us your father works for the CIA. 
This is not new information. 
Tell us what you saw and who you told. 
We didn't tell anyone because we didn't see anything! 
He's telling you the truth! 
Please don't do this! 
Listen to me. Nothing can get 
in the way of this sacred day. 
 Tell us what you saw and who you told. 
 We didn't see anything, I swear! 
 The files deleted themselves... 
 Don't lie to me, Kate! 
 I'm not lying! 
 She's not lying! 
They were self-deleting files! 
We don't know anything! 
 What are you... 
 No! Stop it! 
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! 
Jack, I can spot you from here. 
I'm set. Where are they? 
11 o'clock, 90 metres, moving left. 
 I'm out! 
 Last pack, Jack. 
 Where are they? 
 Ten o'clock, within 50 metres. 
That's it! 
 Where are they now? 
 Ten o'clock, two o'clock, higher ground. 
It's a CTU chopper! 
They're gonna make a sweep! Stay down! 
Stay down! 
Drop it, Jack. I said drop it! 
I don't wanna shoot you just yet, but I will if I have to! 
Drop the gun! Drop it! It's over! 
Stand down! Stand down or he's dead! 
Stand down! She's the only one 
who can get us to the bomb! 
I wanna talk to the president! 
Now! 
Megan. 
Megan! 
 Come here. 
 Kim! 
 Are you all right? 
 Yes. 
 I'm scared. 
 I know. 
 It's scary, but you're doing so good. 
 Let's go. 
Wait. Where are you taking her? 
Do you know where you're going, baby? 
Aunt Emily. She's my mom's sister. 
Do you know where she lives? 
 Santa Barbara. 
 Santa Barbara? 
Santa Barbara. That's so good. 
 Why can't you come with me? 
 Oh... 
Oh, I will soon, OK? 
 I don't wanna go. 
 I know. 
OK, let's go. Your aunt's waiting. 
Go on, OK? You can go now. 
Go on. Go on. Don't cry. 
No, no, shh. I'm gonna see you soon, OK? 
Santa Barbara, that's like, what, 50 miles outside of LA? 
 It's more like a hundred. 
 Oh, God. 
She's gonna be OK. 
 Mr Mason, Tony. 
 Yeah. 
Jack's alive. Seven hostiles were killed, 
but there's a complication. 
 What? 
 Nina Myers took Jack hostage. 
She's demanding to speak to the president. 
Have Richards and Maccabee take him to Bob Warner's office. 
 Let me talk to her. 
 She'll be here when you get back. 
We were supposed to get married in an hour. 
Just let me explain everything to her. 
You have one minute. 
Watch him. I'm gonna make a call. 
 What did they do to you? 
 They just asked me questions. 
 Everything's fine. 
 Are you sure? 
Larry is on his way with a criminal lawyer. 
He's one of the top guys in the city. 
I'm not gonna need a lawyer. 
But your father might. 
I don't understand. 
Reza, what's going on? 
It's your father, Marie. 
They think that he might have something to do with Syed Ali. 
My father? 
 Yeah, he tried to use me. 
 Used you how? 
To do business with Ali, who they say is part of this terrorist group. 
 My father? Part of a terrorist group? 
 They have proof. 
They have this transaction that's connecting one of us to Ali. 
And I know I didn't write it. 
I'm sorry to put you in this impossible situation. 
I love you, and I wanna be with you. 
But right now, something really bad might happen if I don't help them. 
After everything he's done for you, to turn on my father... 
He turned on me. He turned on us. 
What else was I supposed to do? 
Marie... 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Marie. 
We have a secured line ready. 
That's Nina Myers. 
Mike, you should talk to her first. 
I don't want to give her access to me until she gives us something in return. 
Miss Myers... this is Mike Novick. 
I'm the president's Chief of Staff. 
 I asked to speak with the president. 
 He's not available. 
Do you wanna stop this nuclear bomb or not? 
 Of course we do. 
 Then put the president on. 
I'm authorised to negotiate on his behalf. 
What I want is nonnegotiable. 
What do you want? 
I'll tell you where the bomb is in exchange for immunity. 
The president's already granted you a total pardon. 
Except this is a crime I haven't committed yet. 
What crime? 
The murder of Jack Bauer. 
Add that to my pardon, and I'll tell you where the bomb is. 
And if we don't comply? 
We don't have a choice. 
 Is that you, Mr Bauer? 
 Yes. 
Please tell the president that he has no other choice but to accept her deal. 
 Is CTU on a secured line? 
 Yes. This is George Mason. 
We're on a designated channel. 
Except Michelle Dessler and Tony Almeida. 
Do you have alternatives to what she's asking? 
Any weaknesses that we can exploit? 
None. She's a survivor, sir. 
She knows Bauer. 
She knows if she doesn't kill him now, he'll hunt her down and find her later. 
So, in your assessment, Nina Myers is our best chance to stop this bomb? 
Sir, she may be our only chance. 
 Ms Myers, this is President Palmer. 
 I'm listening. 
 Is Jack Bauer there? 
 Yes, Mr President. I'm here too. 
Ms Myers... if the information you provide 
culminates in the successful interception of the nuclear device, you will get everything you asked for. 
You will be pardoned in advance for the murder of Jack Bauer. 
I can live with that. 
Start talking, Nina. 
The bomb will be detonated by a man named Syed Ali. 
We know about Ali. 
We need to know where he is. 
He's at a house in Chatsworth, on Starling Court. 
18 Starling Court. 
Contact the local law enforcement to set up a perimeter. 
Coordinate among the relevant agencies. 
Ms Myers, you're not to take any action until we put our hands on this bomb. 
Agreed. 
 Jack? 
 Yes, sir. 
Is there anything you want me to do? 
Please make sure that my daughter is safe, sir. 
 Tell her that I love her. 
 I'll do that. 
Thank you, Mr President. 
 Jack? 
 Mr President... 
Please, you don't need to say anything, sir. 
There was only one right choice to make, and you made it. 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
He's right, Mr President. 
It's the only way we're going to find this nuclear device... 
before it's too late. 
Sir... 
The press corps is waiting. 
 You've made some changes. 
 Yes, sir. 
 It's better. 
 Thank you, sir. 
For God's sake, stop it! 
What do you want? 
I don't know what you want! 
Yes, you do. 
We didn't see anything. 
We didn't tell anyone anything! 
I swear! I don't know anything! 
How can I tell you what I don't know? 
I believe you. 
If she knew anything, she would have told us. Kill her. 
It won't take them long to find Ali. 
This isn't how you thought it would end, is it, Jack? 
This isn't over yet. 
Jim, we both know that you've been one of the most outspoken opponents to my decision to call off this attack. 
If you have something to say, I would expect you to bring it to me first. 
Does the president have any idea what's going on? 
 I don't think so. 
 Let's keep it that way. 
Thank you for assembling at such short notice. 
I'm sure you're all wondering why I've invited you here. 
It is my sincere belief, based on his response to today's events, David Palmer is unfit to continue as President of the United States. 
Looks like you've had quite a day. 
 I didn't kill anyone. 
 I know you didn't. 
We know Gary Matheson killed his wife. 
We're looking for him now. 
So you're off the hook for everything that happened this morning. 
I thought I made myself clear, Tony. 
We're past Bauer. 
No, sir. You are. I'm not. 
Now, if you're not comfortable with me making my own decisions here, I suggest you relieve me of my duties right now. 
That won't be necessary. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Don't thank me. 
I just don't have anyone to take your place right now. 
 No! 
 Come on, give me that! 
 Kate, are you all right? 
 Yeah. They've got the chip! 
All I want is the chip! 
You come in here, I'm gonna smash this thing. I'll put it right under my foot! 
 Tell me who I'm speaking to. 
 It doesn't matter. 
We got something your girlfriend was about to pay us for. 
Listen to me. 
Five hours ago, a nuclear bomb went off. I'm sure you know. 
The chip will show who's responsible. 
It's vital to our investigation. 
The man you assaulted was an agent bringing the chip to my office. 
Give me the chip back, and I'll let you walk, no questions. 
 You're setting us up. 
 Get back. 
What are you doing? They killed Yusuf. 
We're about to attack three innocent countries. 
I can only stop it with that chip, so I'm gonna do everything I can to get it back. 
Please, Kate, I need your help. 
Get in touch with CTU. Please! 
You have 30 seconds to open that door. 
 Give it to him. 
 Are you crazy? 
This is the only thing keeping him from killing us. 
You got 20 seconds! 
 We should trust you? 
 You don't have a choice. 
 Give it to him. He's serious! 
 So am I. 
He's gonna kill us if we don't open the door. 
Against the wall! Now! Where's the chip? 
I dropped it. 
Don't move. 
Kate! Kate! 
I need wire to tie them up. 
 What about the chip? 
 I've got it. 
Just got this Pentagon briefing stating that our bombers aren't going back to their bases. 
Do you know about this? 
I understand they're holding, awaiting refuelling. 
I ordered them back to their bases. 
I know. That's why I'm here. 
Could you come with me for a minute? 
 Come with you where? 
 To the main conference room. 
What's going on, Mike? 
Please, Mr President, come with me. 
You're ordering me to the conference room? 
No, sir, of course not. I'm sorry. 
I'm... asking. It's very important, sir. 
Mike, I'm the President of the United States. 
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what this is about. 
Mr President... 
it seems there are a number of people, cabinet members, who question whether you're fit to continue as chief executive of this country. 
And these people are in my conference room? 
In a manner of speaking, sir, they are. 
Then let's go see them. 
Mr President. 
So now I see why I had such a hard time reaching you today, Jim. 
You were busy. 
I apologise if this comes as a surprise, Mr President. 
This is a unique situation in the history of our country, calling for unique measures. 
Let's skip the sound bites and cut to the chase. 
What's going on here? 
Mr President, we are invoking the 25th Amendment. 
Who's "we"? 
There's a general feeling that the decisions made today... 
Hold on a minute, Mr Vice President. 
With all due respect, sir, most of us here are scrambling just to understand today's events. 
I think it's way too early to be referring to a "general feeling" about anything. 
Fair enough. For the record, 
let me review the relevant portions of the 25th Amendment. 
If the vice president and the majority of the cabinet determine that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the vice president shall take office as acting president. Everyone clear? 
The 25th Amendment was designed for situations where the president is ill or incapacitated. 
"Unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office." 
The reason for the disability isn't limited to any cause. 
The Attorney General agrees with this interpretation. 
And just what exactly is my supposed disability? 
It seems clear to me that the stress of today's events has overwhelmed you. 
An atomic device has been detonated on American soil today. 
We have clear evidence which countries are responsible, along with details of the terrorist group they sponsor. 
The evidence implicating these countries is not clear, Mr Prescott. Far from it. 
The Cyprus audio has been independently verified by every intelligence group we have. 
I have reason to believe they are mistaken. 
Because of this lone CTU agent, Jack Bauer? 
Yes. Mr Bauer believes that 
the Cyprus audio is a forgery. 
He also believes that he will soon have proof. 
He's been telling you that for hours, Mr President. You still don't have proof. 
If military strikes do not go ahead, casualties to American soldiers would increase by tens of thousands of lives. 
That analysis is undisputed. 
The risk of attacking innocent countries is unacceptable. We have to be sure. 
Everybody is sure, Mr President. 
Everybody but you. 
As it happens, I'm the only who counts. 
This meeting is over. 
Mr President, one way or another, there will be a vote. 
I think that you should be heard before that vote is taken. 
You don't like one of my policy decisions. 
You do not have the right to reverse that policy under the pretence that I'm disabled. 
Mr President, I agree. 
I intend to show a pattern of erratic and irrational behaviour on your part since the start of this crisis. 
In that light, your refusal to authorise military action is simply another symptom of disability. 
Listen to me. All of you. 
I know you're not in the same room with me. 
But you can see and hear me plainly enough. 
Take a good look. 
Do I seem scared? 
Am I breaking into a nervous sweat? 
Am I babbling? At a loss for words? 
Is my voice shaking? 
Can any one of you look me in the eye and tell me I'm disabled? 
Mr President, the issue is not your demeanour over the past few minutes, but your actions over the past 20 hours. 
Mr President, the vice president has raised serious questions and, in my opinion, it would be a mistake to ignore them. 
For my part, I'm confident that if you explain yourself with your usual candour and clarity, all questions will be resolved to the satisfaction of everyone here. 
Mr Prescott, there seems to be a collective feeling that a discussion is called for. 
In the interest of putting this behind us, I'll agree. 
On one condition: when it's over, if I'm supported, you tender your resignation as the vice president of this country. 
Very well, Mr President. I agree. 
I suggest we all take a few minutes to compose ourselves and get on with the proceeding. 
Let's not mince words, Mr Secretary. 
You mean the trial of David Palmer. 
All right, the problem is that they don't correspond. I need them to. 
Ryan, could I have a word with you, please? 
Give me a minute. 
I just got a message that the president called off the military offensive. 
 Who told you this? 
 Someone at DOJ. 
 Someone I trust. 
 I wouldn't worry about it. 
Is it true? 
 Yes. 
 And you knew about it. 
 I did. 
 And you didn't tell me. 
Why keep my people processing intel on a scrapped operation? 
Because there's a strong possibility the White House will reinstate the attack. 
It doesn't make sense. Why would 
the president reverse his orders twice? 
Just keep your people on a war footing. 
Tony, phones are up. 
I got Jack Bauer on line two. 
 Where is he? 
 Kate's house. 
 Why? 
 I don't know, but he has the chip. 
Conference-call him to my office. 
Why are you at Kate's house? 
You were supposed to bring that chip here. 
We ran into some interference. 
Yusuf Auda is dead. 
 What happened? 
 No time to explain. 
He's the only reason we still got this chip. 
I'm trying to read it now. 
I tried a flash card adapter, but it's not working. 
You may be able to override the reader function manually. I'll talk you through it. 
Good. Tony, while she's setting up, 
run a background check on Peter Kingsley. 
It may be an alias. Cross-reference it 
with every major player in the oil industry. 
 Peter Kingsley. Why? 
 I'll explain later. 
First tell the president that we've got the evidence he needs. 
I told him. I found out he's 
called off the military strikes. 
Then we've got time. 
Not necessarily. 
Chappelle said the order may be reversed. 
Why? 
He didn't get specific, but something's going on in Washington that we're not supposed to know about. 
 Michelle, are you ready for me? 
 Yeah. 
I've asked someone to join us. 
Most of you know Ron Wieland. 
Ron is a highly respected national affairs correspondent. 
He had a very interesting experience earlier today. Ron? 
I was covering Mr Palmer's environmental speech when I began to sense a bigger story. 
There were rumours of a terrorist attack on the West Coast, involving a nuclear device. 
I kept asking questions. Next thing I know, 
I was called in to talk to the president. 
He asked me to keep the story under wraps until later, then he'd give me an exclusive. 
 What did you say? 
 That I'd think it over. 
As I was leaving, a secret service agent grabbed me and hustled me into a room. 
I was kept there under guard for several hours. 
Did you feel this was a violation of your rights as a journalist and an American? 
Of course. 
 Ron, were you harmed or threatened? 
 No, sir. 
Did you understand the reason for your being detained? 
I assume it was fear that if word got out of a nuclear threat, panic would strike. 
Do you think the lives of thousands of citizens is less important than a couple of hours of your First Amendment rights? 
No, I don't. But under the Bill of Rights, 
that decision was mine, not yours, Mr President. 
Did you feel that things were out of control in the Palmer administration? 
You're putting words in his mouth. 
I did sense the president was not in control. 
I was trying to balance the need for public safety against Ron Wieland's rights. 
I offered Ron a deal, and he turned me down. 
Nothing was out of control. I might add, 
I had legal precedent for my action. 
Thank you, Mr Wieland. 
I'd like to call someone else to testify. 
He should be ready in a few moments. 
Control CX-5, then hit "enter". 
 Done. 
 Anything? 
I think it's reading it... No, all I'm 
getting are numbers and symbols. 
Take out the chip. 
Make sure the leads are exposed. 
 Damn it! 
 What is it? 
 The chip is damaged. 
 How badly? 
Part of the microprocessor is gone and the leads connected to it. 
Send me any data you have to run through our retrieval program. 
Can you access a complete audio file? 
If it's on there, I'll find it. 
 IT. 
 This is Almeida. 
 Send two guys up here. 
 They're all doing MI for Chappelle. 
I don't care. I need two IT people now. 
 Chappelle specifically... 
 Just do it. I gotta go. 
Almeida. 
Tony, hi, it's Kim. Look, I haven't been 
able to reach my dad. Is he available? 
We're in the middle of something important. 
Can he call you back? 
Tony, please. It'll just take a minute. 
OK. OK, just hold on. 
Are you getting it? 
Yeah, I got it, but you were right  the data is pretty screwed. 
I've assigned two IT people to help Michelle. 
We should get through it in 15, 20 minutes. 
 OK, good. 
 Also, I got Kim on the line for you. 
Thank you, Tony. 
Kim, I got your dad on the line. Go ahead. 
 Dad? 
 Sweetheart. 
 I've been trying to reach you. 
 Are you at the sheriffs station? 
They're taking me to the Mathesons' house to pack up my things. 
Glad you're OK. 
Me too. 
When I thought you were gone, I... 
I just miss you, Dad. I miss you so much. 
I've missed you too, honey. 
I just wanna come home. 
You'll be home soon enough, I promise, OK? 
OK. Hey, Dad? 
 Yeah? 
 I love you. 
I love you too, baby. 
I'll see you soon, OK? 
Bye. 
You knew about this, didn�t you, Mike? 
How long have you known? 
 That doesn't matter, Mr Palmer. 
 It matters to me. 
How long? 
A couple of hours. 
You were part of it, weren�t you? 
When all's said and done... 
you were on Prescott's side. 
No, sir. I'm on your side and always will be. 
This could be a good thing. 
A chance to correct a mistake of historic proportion. 
David, I'm begging you, reconsider your position on this. 
I'm the president, Mike. 
You don't call me by my first name. 
Yes, sir. 
It's transmitting. 
Gentlemen, I'm sorry for the delay. 
The man you're about to see is not entirely well. 
In fact, it's taken a great deal of courage for him to join us at all. 
Roger Stanton, head of the National Security Agency. 
Roger, thank you for speaking with us. 
Yes, of course. Sorry if I seem a bit tired. 
I was tortured for several hours at the operations complex, by order of the President of the United States. 
And why were you tortured? 
Because you thought I knew more than I was saying about the location of the bomb. 
As if the head of NSA would withhold information from the president. 
You're lying. This may work for a while, 
but eventually the truth will come out. 
I have nothing to fear from the truth, Mr President. 
As briefly as possible, Mr Stanton, tell us what happened to you today. 
I arrived at the OC around noon to find that my assistant director, Eric Rayburn, had been dismissed by the president. 
What was the reason given for Mr Rayburn's firing? 
Eric wanted to bring the military into the equation right away, and the president was reluctant to even contemplate the use of military action. 
That's not true. 
For the next few hours, I worked for the president as best I could. 
He was indecisive, erratic and, as I said, terrified to even think of military engagement. 
A little after six this evening, I was arrested on the charge of treason. 
I was taken to a small windowless room. 
The president accused me of knowing more about the bomb than I was telling him. 
 Was that true? 
 No, of course not. 
In fairness to the president, I think he genuinely believed it to be true. 
Why would he hold such a belief? 
David Palmer is a decent man. 
Maybe he's too decent for the times we live in. 
He wanted to avoid war at any cost. 
If he could prove to himself that Americans were behind the bomb, then he'd have a good reason not to use military force against any foreign country. 
I just heard you ordered two ITs onto a retrieval project. 
They were working military intel. 
Jack Bauer has a chip. 
It contains an audio file that we expect will prove the Cyprus audio was forged. 
Where is this chip? 
 It's been damaged. 
 Damaged? 
The data Jack sent us is messed up. 
The audio file has to be reconstituted. That takes time. 
 How long? 
 However long it takes. 
It should take about 15 minutes, sir. 
Mr Chappelle's office. 
 Get a message to the vice president. 
 Right away, sir. 
Ready to tell me everything I need to know? 
Continue. 
We knew about the bomb weeks ago. 
Enough! 
This should end this discussion here and now. 
Yes, I had Roger Stanton tortured. 
It was a horrible thing to do. 
God knows I hated doing it. 
But just as I suspected, he knew about the bomb. 
You've just seen that. 
When I was strapped to a chair and thousands of volts of electric current passed through my body every few seconds, I'm not proud of it, but I dare say I did what most of you would've done - I cracked. 
Told the president what he wanted to hear, that I knew about the bomb. 
You told me more than that. 
You told me about the Coral Snake team. 
You told me that the bomb was at Norton Airfield, information that we corroborated. 
I don't know what you�re talking about. 
Mr Prescott, play the rest of the tape. 
There is no rest of the tape. 
 What? 
 That's all I have. 
That can't be. I was in that room 
for another ten minutes. 
This is all that was transmitted by the OC. 
We did ask for everything. 
There must be a mistake, or deliberate sabotage. 
Mr Stanton had a lot more to say than what you just saw. 
Mr President, couldn't Agent Simmons verify what you�ve been telling us? 
No. I sent him out of the room. 
But the fact remains that Roger Stanton told me about the Coral Snake team and the location of the bomb. Where else 
could that information have come from? 
We have many intelligence agencies, Mr President, thousands of agents combing the planet. 
It could've come from anywhere. 
I know it didn't come from me. 
That's a lie and you know it. Tell them, Mike. 
I only know what the president told me. 
I wasn't in the room. 
Mr Stanton, thank you again. 
You will remain in custody as the president has ordered until this matter is resolved. 
I understand. 
Mr President, if you have any evidence you'd like to present, please do so now. 
The testimony that's been presented here so far is inaccurate and incomplete. 
Roger Stanton is directly responsible for placing a nuclear weapon on US soil. 
I have evidence that proves it, but you�ve given me no time. 
While my behaviour may have been extreme, I was just responding to the extremity of today's events. 
Make no mistake. If we unleash our military 
power on nations that later prove innocent, it will rank as one of the most despicable sneak attacks in history. 
Any chance for peace in the Middle East will vanish forever. 
Even if it costs American lives in the future, we must delay the attack until we are certain of our ground. 
Excuse me. 
I just received an urgent message from CTU division chief Ryan Chappelle. 
Jack Bauer has evidence he claims will prove the Cyprus audio was forged. 
Please, everyone... Sh. Please settle down. 
The evidence is being reviewed at CTU now. 
Mr Chappelle says that the analysis shall be complete within the next few minutes. 
Considering the impact that this evidence will have on these proceedings, I think it's incumbent upon us to wait. 
 I'm looking at it right now. 
 We can't configure it, either. 
 Did you run it through default mode? 
 The audio files are gone. 
They're just some markers that repeat. 
 Thanks, Jason. 
 All right. 
He didn't find anything, either. 
Well, what have you got? 
The chip was more compromised than we thought. 
 Do you have the audio file? 
 Michelle recovered some information. 
It may tell us who programmed it. 
Did you find the audio file? 
That's all I need to know. 
No, we didn't. 
So... Bauer wasted our time. 
Come on. 
Kate? 
Kate, are you all right? 
Everything that's happened today, everything that's still happening... 
I keep thinking it's all my fault. 
Come here. We would never have found 
the bomb in time if it wasn't for you. 
My sister was the one behind the bomb. 
She helped those fanatics. 
Yes. But you�re not your sister. 
I should've seen something was wrong before it got this bad. 
Because of what she did, it could start a war. 
I could've stopped it. 
No, Kate, you couldn't have. 
There are things in this world that are out of our control. 
Sometimes we blame ourselves for them so that we can try and make sense out of it. 
Come here. 
There was nothing you could have done. 
Sorry. Yeah? 
It's Tony and Michelle. 
Excuse me. 
 You got the audio file? 
 No. 
What do you mean? Are you saying 
there's no audio file on that chip? 
If there were, they were destroyed. 
Chappelle wants you in on a call to the president. 
Yeah, I bet he does. 
Some of the information Michelle recovered may be worth looking into. 
What information? 
Identical code fragments in several data streams. 
 What are the fragments for? 
 Nothing. That's the point. 
It's junk code. Programmers sometimes 
embed it into their programs as a signature. 
Michelle traced the sequence to a hacker named Alex Hewitt. 
He's got a file with the FBI. 
You think this is the technician that created the Cyprus audio? 
Yes. 
We can't follow up any more leads, so you have to talk to this guy. 
What's his last known address? 
210 Laurel Canyon Boulevard, North Hollywood. 
I got it. I'll get back to you. 
All right. 
 I'm sorry. I've gotta go. 
 Where? 
We got something off the chip, not what we're looking for, but it's a lead. 
When you're ready, an officer will take you back to CTU so you can be with your father. 
Thanks. 
OK. 
 Jack? 
 Yeah? 
Be careful. 
Thanks. I will be. 
Squadrons have been in a holding pattern since the president called off the attack. 
They just refuelled. 
If we want to resume the operation, we need to come to a conclusion now. 
A few more minutes. This is the difference 
between peace and war, Mr Prescott. 
It's also a pattern that's been recurring over the last few hours. 
Everything will change once Mr Bauer calls. 
It just never quite happens. 
 Yes, what? 
 CTU. 
Jack Bauer and Ryan Chappelle are on the line. 
 This is President Palmer. 
 This is Ryan Chappelle. 
 Hello. 
 Jack Bauer is on the line as well. 
He'll give you an update. 
Mr President, I found the chip. 
Unfortunately, it's been badly damaged. 
Can it prove that the Cyprus recording was forged? 
In its present condition, it proves nothing. 
 Can it be repaired? 
 No, sir. But about an hour ago, 
I was tortured by men who wanted the chip. 
They worked for Peter Kingsley. 
He's part of the group behind the bomb. 
They've manipulated today's events to start this war. 
What? 
To improve their oil contracts in the Caspian Sea and to control the oil coming out of the Middle East. 
I need something concrete, evidence. 
I understand. I'm checking up 
on an address of a man who we believe engineered the recording for Kingsley. It's the best we've got. 
Everything you've seen, are you absolutely convinced the Cyprus recording was forged? 
Yes, sir, absolutely. 
All right, Jack. Thank you. 
The evidence I was hoping for is not yet available, but I believe it will be soon. 
 When, Mr President? 
 I don't know. 
Meanwhile, the window for a surprise attack is rapidly closing. 
It's time to vote. 
Mr Vice President, if you could indulge me for one minute. 
Mr President. 
This Bauer thing is an illusion, a mirage. 
Every time you get near it, it moves further away. 
For your sake, for the country's, authorise the attack. 
All this will just go away. 
And a lot of people, Americans and non-Americans, will die for no reason. 
We don't know that, Mr President. 
Let's get on with the vote. 
Members of the cabinet, you've been presented with the evidence. 
You know what's at stake. 
Those of you who believe the president is able to continue in office, vote yes. 
Those of you who believe he isn't, vote no. 
Mr Novick will conduct a voice poll. 
The numbers will be reflected on the screen. 
Mr Novick? 
Ms Secretary of Transportation, how do you vote? 
Yes. 
Mr Secretary of Treasury? 
No. 
Yes. 
 Almeida. 
 It's Jack. 
I'm half a block from Hewitt's loft. 
Has the FBI sent over his file yet? 
 Yeah. 
 What do I need to know? 
The State Department recruited him. He 
revamped their entire surveillance program. 
He got caught manipulating files that he didn't have clearance for. 
He tried to kill himself, spent a year in psychiatric prison, then was released last September. 
 No connection to Kingsley? 
 No, not that we can find. 
As soon as I get Hewitt, I'll get back to you. 
Any word on what's happening with the president? 
 No, not yet. 
 OK, thanks. 
Mr Secretary of Defence, how do you vote? 
Yes, I believe the president should stay in office. 
Mr Secretary of Agriculture. 
No. 
Mr Secretary of the Interior. 
No. 
Mr Secretary of State, the vote is seven for and seven against. 
 Yours is the deciding vote. 
 I'm aware of that. 
I've never met a man that I respected more than you, Mr President. Never. 
But we are talking about tens of thousands of American lives. 
I'm compelled to vote no. 
Mr President, can you see the results? 
You will have an opportunity to appeal this in four days in front of Congress. 
In the meantime, I must ask you to remove yourself from the decision-making process. 
Please take the president to a holding room. 
Will you please come with us, Mr President? 
Mr President... I'm not a lawyer, sir, 
but as far as I can tell, the Constitution's been followed. 
I've got no choice but to ask you to come with us. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, so help me God. 
Come on. 
Alex? 
Talk to me. 
Jack made it clear that the only way to get proof is if CTU stays out of it. 
 We don't know if he's alive! 
 He's on an open channel. 
You can't trace it, but you can talk to him. 
 Michelle! 
 No, Jack, it's Tony. 
The president asked me for proof that the Cyprus recording was fake. 
The man who can provide proof will only deal with me. 
How do we know he's not using you? 
Ten commandos tried to kill him to stop him making a deal with me. 
Jack. 
 I'm not gonna make it. 
 Just tell me where the evidence is now. 
It's on a memory chip. 
The source recordings prove the Cyprus audio is a fake. 
Where's the memory chip? 
Inside... 
Come on, Wallace. Inside where? 
Doctor! 
He's dead. 
We got the chip. 
Our planes are over the Atlantic. 
They will be reaching their targets in three hours. 
The secretary of defence wants to know how much longer you'll give Jack Bauer to disprove that tape. 
Jack Bauer has up until the time the planes start releasing bombs. 
From the secretary's point of view, that's tying the DOD's hands. 
We're gonna utilise every moment we have. 
 He's not gonna like that. 
 That's his problem. 
In order to exploit the advantages of a surprise attack, we've launched 12 bomb squadrons from three stateside bases. 
But initial air strikes will be launched from our bases in the region here, here and here. 
Your request was for air strikes to begin before your address to the nation. 
I know what I asked for. 
That came out wrong. 
You have done a remarkable job mobilising our forces on such short notice. 
Thank you, sir. 
Mr President, is it fair to assume that you�re still behind the attack? 
Cos I'm sensing some equivocation. 
I told the vice president, but I haven't shared this with the rest of you. 
Jack Bauer, the CTU agent most responsible for finding the nuclear bomb, believes the Cyprus audio is fabricated. 
 Bauer has no hard evidence? 
 Not at this point. 
This battle plan requires our surprising the enemy with a strike of overwhelming force. 
We will lose that advantage if we wait any longer. 
The target countries will mobilise their defences and our casualties will increase over the long term. 
 By how much? 
 Up to 20,000 troops. 
Then we have no choice but to proceed with the plan as stated. 
What I have to say to the president will have a direct impact on the meeting that he's in. 
 He can't be disturbed at this time. 
 Fine. Just make sure he knows I called. 
He's in a meeting with the Joint Chiefs. 
They won't interrupt until it's finished. 
Come on. 
 Almeida. 
 It's Jack. 
 Where are you? 
 I can barely hear you. It's a bad connection. 
 I want you to bring Wallace back here now. 
 Wallace is dead. 
But I got the evidence. It's a memory chip 
containing the original source recordings. 
 How do you know it's real? 
 He died trying to give it to me. 
He had it surgically implanted. I hardly think 
he'd have done that if it wasn't authentic. 
 Where are you? 
 In North Hollywood, 40 minutes from CTU. 
 We'll bring you the chip. 
 Call in your route. I'll send an aerial escort. 
I need you to get in touch with the president. 
He's in a meeting with the Joint Chiefs. 
Not until I confirm what you�re holding is real. 
Jack, come here. 
You've got to at least tell him what's going on. 
 I need you here, Jack. 
 Tony, can you hear me? 
 I hear you, Jack. 
 I gotta go. Please just do what I ask. 
 What? 
 We can't go anywhere with this chip. 
 Look at this, embedded in the silicon. 
 What is it? 
A transponder. It acts like a tracking device. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
Our group uses circuits like this to track sensitive material. 
I don't understand. 
Whoever Wallace stole the chip from tracked him to the warehouse. 
 They'll find us if I don't disconnect it. 
 Can you avoid destroying the audio file? 
 I think so. 
 Good. 
Danny, you have to stop doing this. 
I told you not to call. 
I'm sorry you're upset, but I don't have time for this right now. 
Why? What's going on? 
Nothing. Don't worry. 
We're taking care of things here. 
Really? What am I supposed to do? 
 Sit tight. I'll call you when I get a chance. 
 Forget it. 
Hey. 
Something's wrong with the phones. 
The network's been overloaded since news of the bomb broke. 
 Who were you talking to? 
 No one. What's going on? 
Jack just called. He says 
he's got the evidence from Wallace. 
 Does the president know? 
 We haven't confirmed it's authentic yet. 
The president's acting on the assumption that the recording is real. 
And this evidence may prove that it's not. I know. 
Tony, you've gotta call the president. 
I'm thinking about it. 
This is too big. 
I need something with a finer point. 
What about this? Will that work? 
Yeah. Good. 
 How much longer do you need? 
 A minute or two. 
 One or two? 
 One if you stop bothering me. 
Those people who want their chip back are here. 
Will the tracker still function? 
 The signal should still transmit. 
 I think I can lure them away from here. 
 You and Kate get the chip over to CTU. 
 Us? 
Don't worry. This is gonna work. 
Kate, move here against the wall. 
 Got it. 
 Bring it here. 
Still locked on target? 
This way. 
OK. I want you to meet me at Moorpark 
and Vineland, a few blocks west of here. 
If I'm not there in 15 minutes, leave without me, but you get that chip to Tony Almeida. 
 Be careful. 
 I'll be OK. 
Signal's dropping off. 
 Wait. He's moving. 
 Where? 
Just ahead. Toward the east entrance. 
I'll catch up. 
I waited till the meeting broke to tell you the governor called from Sacramento. 
 What's going on? 
 People are hitting the streets. 
He wants you to dispatch the National Guard like you did in Marietta. 
Mr President, Tony Almeida is holding for you on the emergency Satcom network. 
Why on Satcom? 
Since news of the bomb got out, network circuits have been overloaded. 
90%of all systems went down a few minutes ago. 
 I can talk to Almeida if you want. 
 Put him on speaker. 
Mr Almeida, this is President Palmer. 
You're also on with Mike Novick and Lynne Kresge. 
Jack Bauer just called with some new information. 
I'm a little conflicted about contacting you with this. 
He has evidence that proves the Cyprus recording is counterfeit. 
 What kind of evidence? 
 Source recordings of each of the men. 
 They were then reedited. 
 Have these been authenticated? 
 Not yet. We're getting 'em soon. 
 How soon? 
Within the hour, sir. 
Mr Almeida, your confidence in Jack Bauer is curious. 
An hour ago you told me he assaulted CTU personnel and took illegal custody of a witness. 
 He had no choice under the circumstances. 
 I don't follow. 
The man with the evidence would not have turned it over had Jack involved CTU. 
So what makes you so sure that this is any more real than the Cyprus recording? 
That's just it, sir. I'm not. 
 But Jack Bauer is. 
 Yes, sir. 
Thank you for your candour. 
I'll take this information under advisement. 
Thank you, Mr President. 
I'm calling off the attack. 
Sir, before you do that, we should talk through the consequences. 
We've talked enough, Mike. 
I appreciate your respect for Jack Bauer. I do. 
But you know the man's reputation. 
I know the man. 
Then start thinking about your own reputation. 
Meaning? 
A nuclear bomb was detonated on US soil. 
We've been shown proof connecting the weapon to three nations in the Middle East. 
Proof that may be false. 
Unless you respond decisively, your enemies will exploit that as a failure of leadership, as a sign of personal weakness. 
So what are you saying, Mike? 
That I should continue with a military operation just to prove that I'm decisive? 
 What if Jack Bauer's right? 
 What if he's wrong? 
Sir, we have all heard the Pentagon's assessment. 
Stopping and restarting military action could cost tens of thousands of American lives. 
An acceptable risk if the alternative is waging war against three innocent countries. 
Mr President, we know from past experience these countries aren't innocent. 
I'm urging you in the strongest possible terms to reconsider. 
I've made up my mind. 
Now get General Gratz back in here. 
Conference in the Joint Chiefs. 
They look fine. Send them to District. 
Excuse me. 
Hey. Look... 
I just wanted you to know that I told the president about Jack. 
 You did? 
 Yeah. 
If Jack has what he says he has, the president should know about it. 
How did he react? 
He wants us to keep him apprised of the situation. 
You did the right thing, Tony. 
We'll find out when Jack gets here with that chip. 
 When did he say? 
 About 20 minutes. 
When he does get here, make sure that thing is real. 
I'll pull up the CPB software right now. 
All right. Thanks. 
Tony. 
Yeah? 
Thank you. 
Yeah. 
All circuits are busy. 
Please try your call again. 
 Still no signal? 
 I have signal. 
 I just can't get through. 
 Maybe it's from CTU's end. 
I'm sure they're very busy gearing up for the war against my country. 
There won't be a war, Yusuf. 
They'll get the chip. 
 They're gonna know the truth. 
 Assuming they want the truth. 
They don't want war. 
You sure about that? 
You might feel differently if it was your family being threatened. 
 Vineland and Moorpark, right? 
 Yeah. 
I'll keep an eye out for Jack. 
 He's in the northeast quadrant. 
 Moving? 
 Just stopped. 
 Davis, where are you? 
Sweeping north along the east wall. 
He's inside the northeast corner. 
Pin him down. 
Yes, sir. 
 Do not kill him until I have that chip. 
 Understood. 
He took the tracker off the chip. 
Ronnie, he's running north toward Magnolia. 
Come on, let's go! 
All right, let's get him back inside. 
Is the president dedicated to this action? 
General, this was not a decision he made lightly. 
 I haven't been briefed on this. 
 The president will explain his decision. 
Until he does, you should brief your own staff. 
 All right. I'll take care of it. 
 Thank you for your patience. 
 More blowback? 
 And then some. 
Mike, have you heard anything about this meeting that the vice president called? 
A meeting? 
Apparently he's asked Cabinet members to be on hand an hour and a half from now. 
 What's the agenda? 
 I don't know, because I wasn't invited. 
 Who told you about this meeting? 
 Someone on Gendler's staff. 
He doesn't know anything more than what I'm telling you. 
Is it something to do with the president calling off the military strikes? 
Mike, what else could it be? 
 Did you tell the president about this? 
 No, not until I find out more. 
 For all I know, it could just be a rumour. 
 That's probably all it is. 
 I'll ask around anyway. 
 Keep me posted if you hear anything. 
 O'Hara. 
 Where's Stark? 
Right here. 
Get him up. Yes? 
Ronnie, you got the chip? 
I'm with the agent who took it off Wallace. 
 It was Jack Bauer, wasn't it? 
 Yes, sir. 
We've scanned his clothing and induced vomiting to check his stomach. 
It's a waste of time. He's not gonna 
have it on him. Let me talk to him. 
Yes, sir. 
You're on with Bauer. 
Jack, you're a hero here. Congratulations. 
Let me tell you what I wanna do. 
The world doesn't have to know anything about the arrangement we're about to make. 
 We'll keep it private. 
 Who am I talking to? 
Give me a break. Look, I need the chip. 
So let's not be pigs here, all right? 
You tell Ronnie where it is, I authorise a very large sum, large enough to compensate you for any guilt you might feel. 
It's not for sale. 
If someone wants to buy it, it is. 
How can you justify starting a war just to profit from the outcome? 
We're just controlling the chaos, that's all. 
No, you're causing it. 
Let's not waste each other's time trying to bridge our differences, OK? 
There's only one thing we need to agree on: a price. 
I already gave you my answer. 
When Ronnie's finished, you'll give me another. 
No, my answer's final. 
Ronnie! 
I think he wants to talk to you. 
I heard. I'll get you your answer. 
This man Bauer, I've read his file. 
 So have I. 
 You know he won't be easy to break. 
He'll break. 
 I appreciate your confidence. 
 I've earned it. 
Yes, you have. There's also a time issue. 
Then you'd better let me get started, sir. 
The chip, Jack. 
The chip, Jack. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 Yeah. 
 Jack's bringing a chip in. 
 That's what Tony said. 
He wants me to run point on the analysis. I'm 
having trouble accessing the CPB software. 
Just send it to my screen. I'll do it. 
I just need you to... 
unlock the indexing function. 
 I said I would do it. 
 I don't need you to do it. 
 I need you to unlock the indexing function. 
 What is your problem? 
 You've been gunning for me all day. 
 I could say the same about you. 
I'm just trying to do my job. 
Dessler. 
 Can I see you up here a second? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Just do what I asked. 
 Fine. 
 So what was that about? 
 What? 
You and Carrie, what were you arguing about? 
Nothing. I asked her to open some software 
and she's making me jump through hoops. 
I know you don't wanna tell me, but whatever bad blood there is between the two of you, I gotta know what it is. 
It doesn't matter, especially today. 
It does matter. It's interfering with your work. 
What's the problem? 
When I worked for Carrie over at Division, we were friends. 
I introduced her to my brother. 
He was married. He had kids. 
He left them for her. 
And then she got bored. She dumped him. 
Danny lost everything. His family, his job. 
It got so bad, he tried to kill himself. 
Look... 
It's unfortunate you two have to work together, but you do. 
And I gotta keep this office running today, all right? 
 I understand. 
 Good. 
Almeida. 
 Can I speak with Michelle? 
 Just a second. 
It's for you. 
 Dessler. 
 Your brother Danny's here to see you. 
Show him to my station. I'll be right down. 
Are we OK here? 
Yeah. 
Wow. This is nuts. 
Hey. Hey, little sister. 
Thanks for bringing him in. 
 How are you? You OK? 
 I'm fine. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I wanted to talk to you. 
 We were talking and you hung up. 
 I know. 
I tried to call you back, but the phones weren't working. 
So you came here at 2.30 in the morning. 
I don't have time for this. 
I wanted to apologise to you face to face. 
I'm sorry that I yelled at you before. I'm sorry. 
Apology accepted. But you have to go now. 
It's just this whole thing with the bomb. 
It's not just me. A lot of people 
are afraid of what's gonna happen next. 
Nobody knows what to do, you know? 
It's gonna be OK. 
We're taking care of things here. 
I know. I know you are. 
Why don�t you go home and get some sleep? 
I'll come over as soon as I can. 
 Ignore her. 
 You didn't tell me Carrie works here. 
She's not working here. 
We were short-handed. Danny, please. 
You don't return my calls? 
 Who are you? 
 My sister works here. 
 I've been in the middle of things right now. 
 I was just worried about you. 
 I was hoping you'd be worried about me. 
 Stop. 
 Why? You taking Carrie's side now? 
 Of course not. Come to my station. 
 Hey, come here. I wanna talk to you. 
 Danny! 
Why didn�t you call me back? 
Tell them I'm your brother, Michelle! 
Lynne. 
You were right about the meeting. 
Prescott's calling Cabinet members personally to set it up. 
Is it about the president calling off the attack? 
I don't know yet. My source at Defence says 
he has information. He agreed to meet me. 
 Who is it? 
 Jesper Isberg. 
He won't tell me anything over the phone. 
 When are you meeting him? 
 Now. 
Where? 
I don't think you should be there, Lynne. 
You might spook him. 
I brought you into this. I wanna hear what's 
going on before we take this to the president. 
There's a room upstairs, 522. 
It's used for storage. 
I'll meet you there. 
I'll be right back. 
Michelle? 
Where are you going? 
I was just going over to IT. 
I'm still trying to access the CPB software. 
IT's the other way. 
I just... I just need a minute, Tony. 
Hey. 
Carrie's gonna be fine. 
Is she gonna... 
Is she gonna press charges? 
No, I don't think so. 
It's all my fault. I should've seen it coming. 
It's family. These things happen. 
You can't see it coming. 
He's my brother. I mean, his kids... 
Maybe I should have told him about the bomb. 
It was a tough choice, but you made it. 
And, by the way, you were right. 
No. 
Nothing I've done today is right. 
Michelle. 
All these people today that are dead. 
And then this recording. 
I don't know if we're right about that. 
I can't... I can't do this any more, Tony. I can't. 
Michelle. Come here, come here. 
I'm so tired. I'm so scared. 
It's OK. 
It's OK. It's all right. 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
Tony. 
Chapelle's looking for you. 
Yeah, OK. 
Jack? 
Jack. 
Come on, Jack. 
You're gonna kill him. 
You can't keep doing this. 
Don't ever touch me again. 
 Yes? 
 Have you made any progress? 
 We're still working on him. 
 I told you, there's a time issue. 
Yes, sir. You told me. 
You do not wanna disappoint me on this. 
Get me that chip, Stark. 
I will. 
 So where's this person we're meeting? 
 He'll be here soon. 
Have you heard anything else about why Prescott called this meeting? 
We knew there�d be consequences, Lynne, dissent within the administration, but nothing like this. 
Like what, Mike? 
What do you know about Section 4 of the 25th Amendment? 
It provides that if the majority of his Cabinet feels he's unfit to fulfil his duties that the president could be removed from office. 
And the vice president becomes acting president. 
Prescott can't do that. 
Mike, we're talking about a palace coup. 
 Jesper Isberg? 
 Yeah. 
Give us a moment, please. 
Before we talk to him, I need to know where you stand vis-�-vis the president's decision. 
Are you questioning my loyalty? 
There's going to be a lot of lobbying among the Cabinet. I need to know where you stand. 
I may not agree with the president's decision, but it was his decision to make. 
As far as I'm concerned, it's Prescott who should be charged with treason. 
Are you sure that's how you feel? 
Yes, Mike. 
I was afraid you'd say that, Lynne. 
Mr Isberg. 
I'm sorry. 
What are you doing? 
Where are you going? Mike? 
Oh, my God. 
You're with Prescott? 
Only because David wouldn't listen to reason. 
 You said so yourself. 
 Mike, you can't... 
We've been worried about his indecisiveness since he took office. 
And now it's going to cost the lives of 20,000 Americans. 
I can't let that happen. 
I'm doing this for the good of the country. 
Lie to yourself all you want. 
Don�t you dare lie to me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Mike, this is not... 
What are you doing? Mike! Mike! 
Open this door! 
Open this door! 
Until you hear from me  only me - do not let her out. 
Understood. 
Open this door! 
Open this door! 
The White House confirms the explosion. 
The president will address the nation shortly. 
Police have reported a number of hate crimes against Middle Eastern businesses. 
Authorities are urging people to stay inside their homes and off the street. 
 Jack said to leave without him. 
 Let's give him another minute. 
We've given him much longer than he asked for already. 
We have to get this chip to CTU. 
They're expecting it. 
What if Jack needs our help? 
Getting this to CTU is the priority. 
 You OK? 
 Yeah. You? 
Yeah. 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
He's a damn towel head. 
Your people tried killing us with that bomb. 
You're not getting a second chance. 
Get back. Get back, put your hands up, 
get down on the pavement. 
Facedown! Hands where I can see 'em! Now! 
 Do what he says. 
 Your turn. 
Get down. 
Kate, get back in the car. 
Yusuf! Behind you! 
No! 
Think twice next time you come here! 
Stop it! You don't know what you�re doing! 
Chapelle. 
Ryan, it's Tony Almeida. 
I was told you were trying to reach me. 
Thanks for getting back to me so soon. 
Congratulations on the promotion. 
I wish it could have been under better circumstances. 
 Yeah, Mason was a good man. 
 Yeah, he was. 
 We're pretty busy around here. 
 I just wanted to give you a headsup. 
 About what? 
 I'm on my way over from Division. 
Why? 
I thought you could use some help, with all that' s going on. 
We're doing pretty well here, Ryan. Thanks. 
I'm sure you are. I'll see you in 30 minutes. 
 Dessler. 
 Hey. 
Have you heard anything about your brother yet? 
Yeah. They sedated him. 
They said they'd call me when he wakes up. 
 How are you holding up? 
 OK. 
 You? 
 I'm OK. 
Listen... 
About what happened before. 
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have... 
No, don't. Don't be sorry. 
I'm not. 
Really? 
Really. 
 What about Carrie? 
 Don't worry about Carrie. 
I know her. She's not gonna let this go. 
It's none of her business. It's gonna be OK. 
All right. 
Wake him up. 
 We should probably give him a minute. 
 Wake him up. 
You've been on this side before, Jack. 
You know everybody has a limit to how much they can take. 
Everybody has a breaking point. 
Even you. 
I understand you've got a daughter. Is it Kim? 
You wouldn't want Kim to be an orphan, would you? 
Hit him. 
Again. 
He's no good to us dead. 
Wake him up. 
Wake him up. 
 What's the problem? 
 He's not responding. 
 He's dead. 
 Cut him down! 
Outta the way! 
Get some epinephrine! 
Clear his airway. 
 Where's that epinephrine? 
 There isn't any. 
Go find some! 
 Reza's parents are here. 
 Where is Reza? 
Men from the government are talking to him. 
Who wired that money into Syed Ali's accounts? 
Bob Warner, Marie's father. 
Come with me, please. 
 What did you tell them? 
 The truth. 
How did you get in here without my authorisation? 
 I need to talk to you. 
 You're not my wife any more. 
 It's not about us. 
 Then what? 
There are members of your own administration allying against you. 
That's why I came here today. 
I need to get you out of here because I want you to be safe. 
 OK. 
 Come on. 
Your daughter's not with any of the departments. 
Then where the hell is she? 
Give her to me, Kim. 
We need to get out of here. 
Get his car keys. 
Nina killed your wife. 
My goal is the same as yours, to stop this bomb. Who is the man in Visalia? 
The man in Visalia is Mamud Faheen. He's 
the only one who knows where the bomb is. 
The team's assembled in Visalia. 
We'll have tactical and field units. Jack... 
It's all right. It's all right. Just take it easy. 
Pull up 30 feet from the left wing. 
Escort, lay back. 
Move. 
Jack drugged Miller to get me alone. Tell Mason. 
 Is he in the van? 
 Yeah. 
He's gonna come to in 20 minutes. 
He'll have a headache. 
Here's command authority. 
 I owe you, Doug. Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
Get in the plane. 
Agent Bauer. Rick Phillips, FBI. 
Harris and I will be your transit team to Visalia. 
We'll act as reinforcements once we're on the ground. 
So, we're clear here, Jack? 
I know what you did to Ed Miller. 
Rick, right? Do yourself a favour. 
Stay out of this. 
Do your job, get us to Visalia. 
My job is to make sure this runs smoothly. 
That means keeping her safe. 
Consider me your new chaperone. 
I need two lines set up through CTU. 
One for mobile, one for the translator. 
It'll be tricky cos their phone lines are sketchy. 
It's already done. 
Good. 
Way to go, Kate. 
You broke his parents' hearts, too. 
I'm so sorry, Marie. But I don't know 
what these government people found. 
And believe me, I wish they hadn't have found anything. 
But aren�t you curious? 
Why are they asking Dad questions now? 
You started a witch-hunt in our family. 
No, Marie. It's because Reza 
is connected to some bad people. 
 Maybe even terrorists. 
 You're out of your mind. 
We're not gonna put our heads in the sand, Marie. Or this could end up hurting Dad. 
We're not gonna let that happen. 
Come with me. 
What did you tell them? 
What did you accuse my father of? 
I didn't accuse him of anything. 
It's his company. 
You're pointing your finger at him to cover yourself! 
 Kate! 
 Stay out of this. 
You don't talk to her like that. 
You listen to me. 
I have done more for your father than you will ever know. 
And all I've ever gotten from you is suspicion and resentment. I'm sick of it. 
I didn't connect you to a terrorist. 
No? Then who did? 
I don't know any terrorists! 
All I know is you paid for someone to dig up dirt on me. 
Apparently, he did. 
No, he didn't, because all he found out was stuff about Bob, not me. 
So if anybody's guilty, it is your father. 
 Don�t you make this about my father. 
 Stop it. Stop, Kate! Both of you, stop it! 
Nice work, Kate. 
Call me when you get that. 
 I'll have it today. Four o'clock too late? 
 No. 
 I'll talk to you then. 
 Yeah, good. Alrighty. Byebye. 
If it isn't the Chief of Staff himself. Mike! 
Sherry. 
You look beautiful... as always. 
What are you doing here? 
Did David ask you to come here? 
No. I just showed up on my own. 
So, how have you been? 
 Fine, Mike. Just fine. 
 Yeah? 
Yeah. You know, it's been a challenging 
year. But what is it they say? 
We... learn from our mistakes 
and grow from our misfortunes. 
Have you told that to David? 
No. 
I don't think he's ready to hear that yet. Not now. 
But he is waiting for you, so why don�t you just go on in? 
I'll see you later... I'm sure. 
Here you go, sir. 
Don't speculate, don't say anything. 
We don't know where he is. 
 That is our position. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 All right, good. Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
Sir, we have to talk about Ron Wieland. 
What about him? Does anybody 
know we have him sequestered? 
No, but Jenny got a call from his production crew. They haven't seen him in four hours. 
They'll figure out the last person they saw him with was you. 
Then leak a story. 
Mike. Good to see you. 
I got here as soon as I could. Hi, Lynne. 
Mike. 
Armus brought me up to speed on the Wieland situation. 
I did some research, found out there is precedent for the executive branch taking action against the press at times of national crisis. 
So, when you say leak a story, what kind of a story? 
Make it appear as though Wieland went to Portland on a personal matter. 
Armus can arrange that. It's a band-aid, 
but it'll get us through the day. 
 Talk to Armus. Put it in motion. 
 Yes, sir. 
 I saw Sherry on my way in. 
 Oh. 
 Should I attach any significance to that? 
 It was her decision to come here. 
That's what she said. But I have to tell you, 
I'm surprised you're allowing her to stay. 
For the time being, Mike. 
Just for the time being. 
Let's go to the OC. I'll bring you 
up to speed. There's a lot to cover. 
 You wanna send that on to Division? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Mr Mason? 
 Yeah? 
 I just got off the phone with Ed Miller. 
 How's it going between Jack and Nina? 
He doesn't know. Jack drugged him 
and got on the plane without him. 
Please tell me you're kidding. 
Sloane's bringing Ed back now. 
What should I do? 
They're on a plane. 
There's nothing anybody can do. 
Except hope that his impulse for revenge doesn't cloud his judgement. 
 You mean like drugging one of our agents? 
 What can I say? The guy's a little crazy. 
That's why I didn't want him here in the first place, but... he gets results. 
And we need some pretty big results here, so... 
Just because Sherry tells you that there's a conspiracy against you, that doesn't make it true. 
But if it is true, it will affect every aspect of our response to this bomb. 
Sherry was right about the military evacuation of LA. 
That's specific information. 
She still has well-routed sources. 
But a conspiracy? 
Don't forget where she's coming from. 
She may have her own agenda. 
I'm well aware of that, Mike. She's on 
a tight leash. I wanna find her source. 
Let me look into this so-called cabal against you. 
If there's any substance to it, I'll uncover it. 
Right now, the country needs your attention on the situation in LA. 
Start with Stanton. 
Stanton? 
The head of NSA, conspiring against the president of the United States? 
Aside from the implications if that were true, hasn't he always been an ally to you? 
Yes. But he's also Eric Rayburn's boss. 
It's not inconceivable Rayburn could be doing Stanton's bidding. 
 They have always been on the same page. 
 That's not enough to indict Roger. 
I know. That's why I want you to check him 
out. I'm hoping you can prove me wrong. 
I'll talk to Roger as soon as I settle in, see if I can get a read on him. 
Thanks, Mike. 
 How long until we land? 
 About ten minutes. 
 How far is Faheen from the airport? 
 I'll tell you when we land. 
We are fighting the clock, so you better start talking. How far is Faheen from the airport? 
We need her to cooperate, Jack. 
Threatening her isn't gonna help. 
Fine. 
Get her changed. 
I need her to look like a civilian. 
Come on, let's go. 
No. 
Here. She doesn't leave my sight. 
Everything's working out, right? 
Why don�t you come by? It's not 
the Ritz-Carlton but it works for us. 
 OK, I'll come on down. 
 I gotta go. 
 Yeah? 
 Jack's about to land in Visalia. 
 Have they got a location for Faheen? 
 No. Not until they land. 
 Stay on it. I'll be down in a minute. 
 Right. 
Double espresso au lait, and it's hot. 
Out of three. And five cents is your change. 
Hello? 
John, it's your father. 
 Hello? You there? 
 Yeah, yeah. I'm here. 
Look, I... I know it's been a while. 
 Two years. 
 That long? 
 Yeah. 
 That's my fault. 
John, I'd really like to see you today. 
 I can't. 
 It's important. 
Dad, listen, you can't just call me out of the blue and expect me to jump. 
I don't really want to see you, and even if I did, I can't. I'm busy. 
I know I screwed up. I understand 
if I'm not your favourite person. 
But can you do this one thing for me? 
Come to CTU. You know where that is, right? 
I can't do it today, Dad. 
I'm in the middle of something. 
 Tell me what's going on. 
 I need to see you, that's what's going on. 
You're not listening to me, Dad. I'm gonna 
have to call you when I have a chance. 
Get up. 
Let's go. 
 I'm Agent Dockerty. 
 Jack Bauer. Phillips and Harris. 
We're all set up. 
All we need now is a location. 
Where we going, Nina? What's the location? 
 A thrift store on North Collins. 
 The name? 
 Crescent Collectibles. 
 Our transportation? 
Three teams, three vehicles. 
They're waiting for your orders. 
Crescent Collectibles is in the De Anza district. That's not too far. 
 We can set up base camp here. 
 Do it. Take her. 
 What you wanna do with her? 
 She stays with me. 
Why? Keep her here 
and my guys will watch her. 
 I'm gonna use her. 
 Use her how? 
You'll see. 
 All right, everyone. Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Roger. 
 Mike. I heard you were here. 
I understand the president handed Eric Rayburn his walking papers. 
Eric messed up. 
The president was right to dismiss him. 
Still, he fired someone you appointed. 
It takes character to support that. 
I got a nasty workload today. 
You have to excuse me. 
Actually, the president wants me to insert myself into your day. 
That might be difficult. 
I'm moving a mile a minute here. 
I understand. I'd like to look at any paper 
you have on the most active leads. 
Let me play catch-up. 
All right. We can use a little help 
in the civil response area. 
Great. I'll be working up here in four. 
Get me what you got. 
 Update me. 
 CTU Los Angeles is yielding good leads. 
They raided a warehouse within city limits and found weapons-grade nuclear material. 
Langley is using satellite playback to determine who was there. 
 A suspect was killed? 
 There was a shootout. 
Division's having a hard time ID'ing the body. 
What's this? 
Jack Bauer is still involved in the investigation. 
I thought he was dismissed after his assignment. 
He's heading the team that's tracking Mamud Faheen. 
And Nina Myers, the woman you granted immunity to, she's helping them. 
Bauer and Nina Myers are working together? 
Yes, sir. I believe he volunteered. 
 What's the time divisibility? 
 From the time we break in, 30 seconds. 
 What about the roof? 
 We're looking to see if it's viable. 
It's not. He'll have sensors on the wall. 
You go through the front door, Faheen'll commit suicide. 
If he's so willing to die, why'd he leave LA? 
He doesn't want to be collateral damage, but he'll die to protect the plan. 
We can't take a chance. 
We need this guy alive. 
 Gas canister? 
 He knows our protocols, and he's prepared. 
 How does he know your protocols? 
 She gave them to him. 
It doesn't matter. Nina, you're going in. 
 What? 
 He knows you. 
 He also thinks I'm in prison. 
 Make him believe you got out. 
The day his bomb's going off? 
He'll know I'm lying. 
You're a good liar. The only way he's gonna 
know is if you let him. We need 30 seconds. 
He will put a bullet in my head before I say hello, and then he'll turn the gun on himself. 
We'll make sure he doesn't turn the gun on himself. 
 How's it looking? 
 Good. We're just waiting for the feeds. 
Do we know what dialect Faheen speaks? 
 Yeah. Nina gave us the information. 
 Mr Mason? Tony Almeida's on the line. 
 Yeah, Tony. 
 Naiyeer's starting to talk. 
He says Bob Warner is the one that had dealings with Syed Ali. 
Warner claims he doesn't know anything. 
Bring them both in. 
We'll separate them and turn up the heat. 
Are you giving me the OK to arrest them? 
 If they don't come willingly, yes. 
 On what charge? 
I don't care if it's jaywalking, just bring 'em in. 
OK. You got it. 
 What's going on with my father? 
 Give me a minute, please. 
I need you to get Bob Warner. 
We're gonna finish this up at CTU. 
Got it. 
Reza, I'm gonna need you to come with us. 
 Come with you where? 
 Back to CTU. 
 For what? 
 Further questioning. 
I'm not going with you anywhere. 
Look, I'm not arresting anybody... yet. 
But I will if you force me to. 
Now, you're coming with us either way. 
How we do this is entirely up to you. 
Do what the man says. Don't argue with him. 
 Bob, I haven't done anything wrong. 
 Reza. 
Reza, please, do this for me. 
OK? 
 Then I'm coming with you. 
 We can't take you with us. 
Then I'll follow you. 
You've ruined my wedding day. 
I'm not gonna let you separate me from my fianc�. 
Right this way. 
Dad? 
Call everyone, explain the wedding's been postponed. 
I want you to call Larry. Tell him where I am. 
 Dad, Larry's a tax attorney. 
 It doesn't matter. 
It doesn't matter. He'll know what do. 
 OK? 
 All right. 
Good afternoon. 
You two haven't been formally introduced. 
Lynne Kresge, Sherry Palmer. 
Lynne. It's lovely to meet you. 
Mrs Palmer. Mr President, there were 
a few guidelines from Director Stanton that I wanted to go over with you in this meeting. 
OK. Let me just break the ice here. 
Lynne, I have invoked executive privilege and have granted Sherry a provisional security clearance. 
 I see. 
 This meeting is about the possibility of people inside this administration who may be organising against me. 
 Against you? 
 David. 
Maybe you should bring Lynne up to speed on where we are with Roger Stanton. 
 Mr President? 
 Things have been happening too fast today. 
Our problems are compounded by the possibility of a dissenting faction. 
 You think Roger might be a part of that? 
 It's possible. 
If you don't mind my asking, sir, what led you to this hypothesis? 
It troubles me to articulate this, Lynne, but the ambassador's helicopter accident solved a lot of Roger Stanton's issues. 
 Those issues were shared by many... 
 I'm so sorry to interrupt, David. 
But there's something else that you probably don't know, Lynne. 
And that is that Roger Stanton has been having secret meetings with the minority leader in the Senate, and Eric Rayburn has been in attendance. 
Actually, Sherry, I am aware of those meetings. 
They were trying to forge a bipartisan base in order to stop questionable allocations made by the Armed Services Committee. 
And, sir, the only reason I did not brief you on this earlier is because the vote is not for another two months. 
But I have very detailed records, if you would like to take a look at them. 
This doesn't solve our problems today. 
We've got to avert a disaster and we can't do that if our own people are working against us. 
Now, I need to know that Roger Stanton is supporting this administration. 
I'm already working alongside Roger. 
Lynne, I'd like you to keep track of your conversations with him as well. 
Now, I've put together a list of people on the Hill who might be able to help in this matter. 
Thank you, Mike. 
LA Investigations. Paul Koplin speaking. 
Hi. This is Kate Warner. 
Is Ralph Burton there? 
No. I'm sorry, Kate, Ralph's not here. 
Can I help you with something? 
 I need to talk to Ralph. 
 He left for the day. 
He works for me. I'm familiar with the case. 
Is there something I can do for you? 
I need some help. 
I have to get into my father's private records. 
Lynne? Lynne? 
 Yes? 
 Can I have a sec? 
Sure. 
I know that you're uncomfortable with me taking some of these tasks from you. 
After all, I'm not officially on David's staff. 
Mrs Palmer, my discomfort has nothing to do with you being on his staff. 
My only concern is to serve the president. 
I need to know the people around him are competent. I don't know you. 
You seem like a pretty smart woman, so let me explain something to you clearly. 
Mm. 
David did not get here by himself. 
He's had competent people around him his entire life. 
Obviously, you're one of them. 
Not necessarily the best, just the most recent. 
So have some respect for those of us who put him into office. 
We just might be able to help you. 
Fair enough. 
Be careful, Sherry. 
I need Lynne. 
Don't turn this into a competition. 
I understand. 
I just... need her to know that I'm not 
just around here as window-dressing. 
 I'm sure she got the message. 
 I'll behave. Promise. 
Sherry... you don't have 
a lot of friends here today. 
In fact, it seems like every time I turn around, somebody's advising me to send you away. 
Then why don�t you? 
Because you may be able to get information that nobody else can. 
OK, slow down. 
As soon as we get a positive ID, we'll be in within 30 seconds. 
 This is it. 
 Get out. 
Get out! 
All teams on alert. 
Nina is in play. Nina is in play. 
This is team two. We've got her. 
Roger that, team two. 
Stay on frequency one. 
 Michelle, can you read me? 
 Copy. 
OK, she's in. We're moving into position now. 
Is there something I can help you find? 
 I need to see Mamud. 
 I'm sorry, I don't know any Mamud. 
Tell him Nina is here to see him. 
Nina? 
Wait here, please. 
Go, go, go. 
Come with me. 
Michelle, I've got static. There's nothing 
on my monitor. What's going on? 
She's leading her through a door into a hallway. 
Against the wall. 
Hands in the air. 
They're checking her for weapons. 
 What are they saying? 
 They thought she was in prison. 
Nina said she escaped. 
Now they�re taking her into another room. 
It looks like the one off the east exit. 
 Who is she talking to? 
 I can't tell. The target's still in shadow. 
What are they saying? 
She said... She's explaining who 
she had to pay to escape from prison. 
 Jack, should we go? 
 Not until I have confirmation it's Faheen. 
 My audio went dead. 
 I lost mine, too. 
 OK, that's it. Everybody go! 
 OK, OK. 
Stand in position! 
Let's go! 
Stand in position! 
Go, go, go, go! 
Phillips! Faheen's unconscious! 
She's gone. Nina's gone. 
Secure the building. 
This is Phillips. 
We need medics at the east entrance. 
Drop it. 
We're leaving LA now, Aunt Carol. We'll 
probably be another four or five hours. 
OK, we will. Bye. 
 Damm it. 
 You gotta be kidding. 
 Just play it cool. 
 Cool? We're in a stolen car. 
 Licence and registration? 
 Did I do something wrong? 
You were speeding. 
 Registration, too. 
 This is my boss's car. 
I'm not sure where he keeps it. 
I'm sure it's in here somewhere. 
 I think this is it. 
 Here you go. 
I'll be right back. 
 What are you doing? 
 Anything else I can do? 
 No, Ken. I got it from here. 
 Got it. 
I'm sorry, John. 
Hey, I told you I needed to see you, right? 
What happened here? 
Never could get you to watch the news, could I? 
If you're looking to bond, having your son arrested isn't the best way to do that. 
I don't have much time, John. Things are 
happening here. I can't go into it fully. 
 You could never go into anything. 
 It's my work. 
 Look into it if you start a second family. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
Look... I understand if you're angry. 
I'm not angry, Dad. I don't care. 
I really just don't understand. 
What are you trying to do here? 
I got this bank account. 
Nobody knows about it. 
It's got a couple hundred thousand dollars in it. I want you to have it. 
The number to my book-keeper, who I've spoken to. He'll be transferring the money. 
You bringing me here to tell me you're giving me money? 
What did you expect me to do? Expect me 
to give you a hug? I don't want your money. 
Then give it to your mom. I'm sure she does. 
 Cos thing is, I'm not going to be needing it. 
 Why is that? 
Why is that, Dad? 
You don't bring me here, offer me a small fortune, then not tell me what's going on. 
I'm dying, John. 
You son of a bitch. 
Is it cancer or something? 
Something like that, yeah. 
Look, John... something bad 
is gonna happen in Los Angeles today. 
 And I need you to leave town. 
 You want me to leave now? 
Go to Phoenix and stay with your mom for a little while. 
I mean it. It's dangerous to be here. 
I can't explain it to you, but you just have to go, OK? Just go. 
Dad, listen. I don't... This doesn't matt... 
Damm it! 
You're a good kid. 
I hope I didn't mess you up too bad. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
Get out of here, all right? 
Just get out of here, OK? 
Oh, God. 
The vehicle is registered to a Gary Matheson. 
 We can't let him take us back to LA. 
 I know. 
Why's he taking so long? 
 You say this is your boss's car? 
 Yes. 
 Who's the little girl? 
 I'm her au pair. 
 Her what? 
 She babysits her. 
I wasn't talking to you. 
I'll tell you what. 
I'm gonna let you get off with just a warning this time. But you slow down, all right? 
 Yes, Officer. Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
Hold up! 
You want to step out of the car and open up the trunk? 
Step out of the car and open up the trunk. 
Put your hands on your head and lay on your stomach. 
Get down. Get down! Get down. 
Get out of the car! 
Keep your hands on your head. 
 What's going on? 
 Lay down on the ground. 
Carla! Oh, my God! He killed her! 
 What's happening, Kim? 
 Megan, get back in the car! 
Put your hands behind your head. 
Stay there. Cross your legs. Stay still. 
Officer in need of assistance. 
Jack Bauer's interrogating Syed Ali as we speak. 
We'll be informed of his progress on a minute-by-minute basis, but nothing yet. 
We're certain he knows the location of the bomb? 
 Jack Bauer is. 
 Make sure he has all the resources he needs. 
They will kill your family if you don't tell me where the bomb is. 
Where's the bomb? 
Tell me where the bomb is! 
 Kill him. 
 No! No! 
 I will tell you! 
 Hold on! 
 It's Jack. 
 What do you have? 
The bomb's at Norton Airfield. 
They're gonna fly it over the city. 
Your meeting's changed. Now it's with me. 
So you're confirming that Roger Stanton is involved? He knew about this bomb? 
Roger's more involved than David could possibly know. 
I think you orchestrated all of this. 
You have your own and not the president's best interest at heart. 
I got into a car accident. I started running. 
Before I knew it, I had no idea where I was. 
I wanna get back to the highway and get outta here. 
The highway's a couple of miles that way. 
But the way there is not safe at night. 
My place is a half-mile that way. 
I can put a roof over your head for the night. 
They've found Reza, haven't they? 
They know what's happened. 
Tell me, please, what happened? 
You wouldn't understand, Kate. 
People have to die for things to change. 
 This is Bauer. 
 Jack, this is Tony. 
 You're about ten minutes from the airport? 
 Yeah. 
 You got a tail number on the aircraft yet? 
 Not yet. 
You'll link up with the assault team. 
They're starting to lock the grounds down. 
OK, that sounds good. 
Tony, have you contacted Kim yet? 
No, I haven't. I called the sheriffs station. 
They sent out search teams. 
I don't know why she hasn't contacted us. 
She can't go back to LA, and the LAPD's looking for a murder suspect. 
She's not gonna reach out to us. 
We've gotta find her. Understand? 
 I'm putting every resource on it. 
 Do everything you have to. Thanks. 
 How much further is it? 
 Not much. 
Ow. Ow! Damn it. 
Here, let me see that. 
We really ought to get you to a doctor. 
No, I told you, it's not safe for me in LA. 
Because people there think you did something you didn't do? 
Yeah, that's right. 
 You don't believe me. 
 It doesn't matter. 
You don't wanna go back to LA. 
That's good enough for me. 
There it is. 
Ready to tell me everything I need to know? 
Continue. 
We knew about the bomb... weeks ago. 
Thank you, Simmons. 
What do you mean, "knew"? 
We let it in the country. 
Tracked it all the way. 
We allowed it to sneak through customs, and we allowed the Second Wave terrorist cell to operate... unimpeded. 
God, Roger. A nuclear bomb? 
There's no chance that this bomb is ever gonna go off. 
There never was. 
We had a Special Ops team following it every step of the way. 
Colonel Samuels' team. 
The mission was to take the bomb out of play... 
at the last possible moment. 
What are you trying to do? 
Start a war with the Middle East? 
 No. 
 Then what? 
Your defence policy is too passive. 
 You need more resources. 
 You're trying to hijack my presidency. 
No, no, no. I'd like to give it some balls. 
You're gonna call your Special Ops team. 
Tell them to secure the bomb. Now! 
They went dark three hours ago. 
Not accepting any new incoming communications till the mission's complete. 
And where were they? 
Where were they? 
Norton Airfield... Los Angeles. 
The shower's in there. 
You're welcome to use it. 
Try not to stay in there too long. 
There's not a lot of hot water. 
There's some towels in there, and I'll try and get you some clean clothes. 
The door has a lock. 
Thanks. 
I just got off the phone with Division. 
Syed Ali named three more Second Wave terrorists in the LA area. 
I want two transport teams assigned to each one. Pick 'em up now. 
OK. 
Hey, guys, heads up. They just received 
a second confirmation from NSA in Oregon. 
The location of the bomb is indeed Norton Airfield. 
Jack Bauer's en route. I want every 
available field agent over there now. 
 This is Bauer. 
 There's a new wrinkle, Jack. 
 How far are you from the airport? 
 A couple of minutes. 
What kind of a wrinkle? 
There's a hostile US paramilitary unit standing between you and the bomb. 
A Coral Snake team headed up by Colonel Ron Samuels. 
It's the same unit that took out our plane. 
What is going on? 
Why is a US military unit aiding these terrorists? 
As far as we know, they're not. 
The best we can make out, they wanna be the ones to secure the bomb. 
They'll treat anybody who stands in their way as an adversary. 
Order Colonel Samuels to tell his team to stand down. 
They went dark three hours ago. 
They're a rogue unit, acting on their own authority. 
 How do I find them? 
 I wish I could narrow it down. 
Just somewhere at the airport. 
I'm trying to get manpower up from Camp Pendleton. 
This is bad, George. 
Yeah, it is. Our best bet is still 
you getting past them to the bomb. 
Yes, I understand. 
What's happening? 
I don't know yet. CTU hasn't 
been able to locate your sister. 
As soon as they do, they'll contact me. Sorry. 
This is gonna take longer than I thought. 
Omar! 
Dispatch, this is 4827... 
Kate... 
You've seen terrible things today, but I need you a little longer, in case we find your sister. 
Are you OK with that? 
 Agent Baker. 
 Jack. 
Take Miss Warner to the secured area, make sure she's comfortable. 
You'll need this. 
Thank you. 
Jack Bauer. Steve Goodrich. 
I'm heading up the assault team on-site. 
I was told you have further intel on the group? 
These are individual military records of every soldier under Samuels' command. 
 What's our profile with them? 
 They're gonna treat us like hostiles. 
 That doesn't make sense. 
 No, but that's the situation. 
 Is your team ready? 
 Inside. 
We got airport schematics. 
Good. Everybody gather round! 
We are going to be engaging hostiles in a large uncontrolled area. 
I want everyone wearing ID tags, no exceptions. 
Anybody wants to leave this area, check with me first. 
 Who's got the schematics? 
 Here, sir. 
Here's the situation: there is a nuclear warhead somewhere on-site. 
There's an armed Delta team surrounding it. 
I want three sub-units. Unit one makes the 
first sweep. Unit two coordinates air tactical. 
Unit three will await my command as soon as I've got a 20 on the bomb. Understand? 
Yes, sir. 
Good luck, gentlemen. 
Lieutenant, set up your teams. 
Gentlemen, team A, B. 
Column of two on me. Let's go. 
Bauer's set up the staging area at the airfield. 
OK. 
 Tony, we got a little problem. 
 What's up? 
Brad Hammond from Division is on his way. 
They want to shut us down and run everything. 
We're up and running now. 
Not 100%. We're still having 
intermittent packet loss. 
Division's uncomfortable with us running this operation out of a compromised location. 
We don't have the time to give these idiots the grand tour. We're closing in on this. 
They're on their way, so we just gotta deal with it. 
Hey. How you feeling? 
 A lot better. Thank you. 
 Have a seat. 
So why is it that you live up here like this? 
I don't know. I guess I just got 
sick of the whole LA scene. 
It's not like I hate anyone there. 
There's just too many people. 
Don't have that problem up here, huh? 
No, it's just the opposite. 
So, why don�t you move to a small town? 
Why do you have to be by yourself? 
I don't know. 
So, tell me again why you can't go back to LA. 
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me, so... 
What? 
My father works for the government. 
A counter-terrorist unit. 
He said that someone's gonna detonate a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles today. 
What's so funny? 
I knew it. I've been telling people 
that this is gonna happen for over a year. 
No one would listen to me. 
So, you knew about these terrorists? 
Not these ones specifically, but yeah. 
Read the foreign papers. Look over the fence. 
The whole world hates America. 
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. 
Don't worry. We're far enough away. 
We won't get hurt. 
No one's far enough away. 
What about the fallout? 
No one can predict where the wind's gonna take it. 
I'm gonna show you something, but you can't tell anyone. 
What is it? 
After we eat. 
Where are we on locating the Coral Snake commandos? 
Bauer and his teams are looking for them. 
 CTU is updating us every ten minutes. 
 Good. 
This cannot possibly have a good outcome. 
We've got two highly trained American military groups about to face off. 
CTU has a formable presence. 
If the commandos are there, CTU should be able to control the situation. 
 Mr President, we've got something new. 
 What? 
Our com team discovered a covert link between Stanton and Bruce Gluck. 
 The Michigan senator? 
 Yes. 
It looks like they were working together. 
How would you like to proceed? 
Sherry knows Gluck and his key staffers. 
They worked closely together during the primaries. Bring her in. 
Here? Into the OC? 
Yes. She'll need access 
to our secure databases. 
 Sir, I feel I must... 
 I don't wanna argue about this. 
Just do it. 
Why's it taking so long to get this number? 
Barely anything here. There's something... 
 We need this, Randy. Come on. 
 I'm on it. 
They're sending Division to do an evaluation. 
Why are they doing this now? 
We're operational, getting results. 
Why don't they leave us alone? 
They will. This is just Chapelle's 
way of doing stuff over there. 
What about George? 
When they get a look at the shape he's in, they're probably gonna yank him. 
I'm keeping an eye on him, all right? 
Just get everyone to Norton. 
What have we got? 
Military-issue combat boots. Five sets, 
all leading in here, less than an hour old. 
 Anything coming out? 
 Still in there. 
Have your team ready to move on my signal. 
It's definitely Colonel Samuels' men. 
If these guys are dead, who's tracking the bomb? 
This is Baker. Copy that. 
We're moving into position now. 
This bank was knocked out, but we didn't lose any data. 
The same data is mirrored at Division. 
We don't need to risk running these operations from a jury-rigged system. 
You can't run a mission on data alone. 
My team has more experience implementing than anyone at Division. 
I don't think that�s true, but the point is moot. 
Start to ship some of your people to our offices. 
And waste an hour on transporting and set up, with a nuclear bomb ticking away? 
I was wondering if this place had a director. 
 Brad, good to see you. 
 George. 
I heard you're not feeling well. 
I imagine you've heard all kinds of things today. 
But a bad day for me is better than a good day for anybody on your side of the freeway. 
 That right? 
 We're not shutting down. 
We got way too many active protocols in play here. 
Your systems failed their checks this morning. 
This morning. Everything's fine now. 
Eileen, show Brad here how our systems are exceeding all of their time horizons. 
Yes, sir. 
Think you can do that at Division? 
Don't believe everything you hear, Brad. Thank you. 
 Come on. 
 What is it? 
You'll see. 
 I'm not sure, Lonnie. 
 Come on, don't be scared. 
Come on. 
Watch your head over here. 
It's a bomb shelter. 
Short of a direct hit, you could survive down here for a pretty long time. 
 You did all this yourself? 
 It took me two years. 
After I dug it out, it wasn't too bad. 
Hey, check it out. I'm kind of a coffee junkie. 
I could pretty much handle anything, but I gotta have my java. 
These beans are from Argentina. 
Here, smell this. 
Wow. 
 That's great. 
 The best. 
Mm, that's my favourite smell. 
Hey! Hey! 
Hey! Where are you going? 
Kim! 
What's wrong? 
I just got a little claustrophobic down there, that's all. 
You're shaking. Are you OK? 
 I don't think I should be here, Lonnie. 
 Why not? 
I don't know you, and you live here by yourself with a bomb shelter with guns... 
Think about it, Kim. It's gonna be 
people like me who'll survive today... 
if what you say is true. 
 Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. 
 You didn't. 
A lot has happened to me today, and with the bomb in LA, I just think I need to go to my Aunt Carol's to be with family. 
Whatever, Kim. If you gotta go, go. 
The green card will give you access to the system rooms, and the red card will get you into the network. 
Thank you, Lynne. 
I'm sorry you weren't able to gain access to the OC earlier. 
What made the president change his mind? 
I'll let the president fill you in. 
I'd like to make it clear that you are not to interface directly with the personnel once inside the OC. 
Please see me if you need anything. 
 You want me to run everything by you? 
 I'm familiar with the internal politics. 
 I'd be able... 
 You'll be able to do what, Lynne? 
I'm trying to maintain some form of protocol. 
No, you're trying to position yourself between me and David's inner circle because you don't trust me. 
Instead of talking about protocols, just say what's on your mind. You don't want me here. 
 Mrs Palmer... 
 No, you don't me here. 
So let's just quit playing games. 
How dare you speak to me like this. 
I was appointed by the president because of my qualifications in foreign policy. 
I don't know what makes you think you can lecture me. 
Fine. You don't wanna play games? 
I don't like you. 
And I don't like you being here. 
Now we're communicating. 
All right. You should have 
everything you need here. 
 Thanks. I'll get it back to you. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Are you ready? 
 Yeah. 
Stay close to me. 
It's a 15-minute walk to the highway. 
 What was that? 
 I don't know. 
It's Mike Kramer, the park ranger. 
He's probably looking for you. 
The police probably called him. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 They're gonna send me back to LA. 
Lonnie. 
Hey, Mike. 
 What's up? 
 Following up on a missing person's call. 
 Seen anyone tonight? 
 No. Who are you looking for? 
A teenage girl. 
She ran away from a car accident. 
 Why would they be looking out here? 
 Cos she was in custody. 
 In custody? For what? 
 Kidnapping and murder. 
Wow. 
 You got company? 
 What? No, no. 
Doug came by earlier. 
I haven't cleaned up yet. 
 Doug O'Keefe from the fire district? 
 Yeah. 
 I heard he was still mad after last week. 
 It was just a card game. 
You emptied his wallet. 
 Keep your eyes open, OK? 
 I will. 
I'll see ya, pal. 
 Don't worry. He's gone. 
 Thank you. 
Kidnapping? Murder? 
I didn't do it, I swear. 
Can we hang out here for a few more minutes, till he clears the area? 
Yeah, I think it's a good idea. 
Hey, Lonnie? 
I'm really lucky that you were here. 
You've been a really good friend. Thank you. 
Find out about Glock's relationship with Stanton. 
I'm interested in any meetings that both Rayburn and Stanton attended. 
Fine. I know exactly who to call. 
Good. I'll have Lynne 
set you up with a work space. 
That's great. Lynne's been quite helpful. I... 
 I wanna thank you, David. 
 For what? 
I know how difficult it is to get clearance in here, and I'm certain your advisors don't want me... 
Sherry, stop distilling everything down to politics. 
We have a need for information. 
Hopefully you can fill it. 
And I will... Mr President. 
Sherry, I'm sorry. 
I didn't mean to sound rude. 
I really do appreciate what you�re doing. 
That's why you're here. 
Mr President. 
 Yes, Mike. 
 I just got off with CTU Los Angeles. 
Jack Bauer found the Coral Snake commandos. 
 So it's over? 
 I'm afraid not. 
All six members of the team had been killed before Bauer got there. 
What about the bomb? 
Roger, your men are all dead, and there's no sign of the bomb. 
That's not possible. 
Your insane plan backfired. 
Those men were our last chance to find the bomb, and now they�re dead. 
My God. 
You're misguided, but you are not crazy. 
You do not want this bomb to go off! 
Of course not. 
Then tell me, who else could have known about this? 
No one. They were on their own. 
Somebody killed six highly trained commandos. 
That's not the work of a bunch of suicide bombers! 
 Six commandos? 
 That's right. 
There were seven. 
 What's the word at the airport? 
 There's too many places it could be. 
Got it. It's either N34G5, or it's N34G6. 
 Michelle. 
 I'm on it. 
N34G5. It's registered in California, 
and it's at Norton Airport, hangar MD7. 
Get Bauer. 
Down the runway to here, then to these hangars all down here. 
 Bauer. 
 It's Tony. 
We got a tail number on that plane. N as in 
"November", three, four, G as in "golf", five. 
The FAA has got it spotted in hangar M as in "mama", D as in "delta", seven. 
OK. We got it. Let's go. 
Hangar MD7 at the other end of the airport. 
The third hangar from the end. 
There it is! Go, go! 
He's trying to make a run for the north runway. Send a team over to cut him off! 
Pull up alongside of him! 
Damn it! 
The pilot has been hit! 
The pilot has been hit! 
Put your hands in the air! 
Put your hands up! 
Put your hands above your head! 
Keep your hands up! 
He's got it in the plane! 
Get the nuke emergency team here now! 
You're clear until the threat passes. 
When it does, we're gonna re-evaluate. 
Fine. 
See somebody about that cough. 
You don't look so good. 
Appreciate your concern, Brad. 
Lonnie, what are you doing? 
What are you listening to? 
Police band. I'm just scanning to see 
if there's anything about your APB. 
I'd hate to get you out there and then find out there's a roadblock and a bunch of cop cars. 
 Find anything? 
 Nothing yet. 
Good. 
Looks like you're not gonna make the Ten Most Wanted. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What? 
Wait, wait. 
 It can't be. 
 What is it? What's wrong? 
 It happened. 
 What? The bomb went off? 
All the LA stations went to static. 
Ventura County's talking about a flash. 
 Now they�re gone. 
 I don't see anything. 
Here, here. Listen for yourself. 
This station, nothing. This one, nothing. 
This one, nothing. They're all dead. 
 I gotta get to my dad. 
 No, we can't stay up here. 
 The radiation. We gotta get down below. 
 No! 
We gotta go now, before it's too late. 
Come on. 
OK. 
This is Paul Tate live from the Skywatch. 
A beautiful night in Los Angeles as we near the nine o'clock hour. 
Traffic is light in both directions. 
 Try the internal. 
 Give it to me. 
It's no good, either. It's no good. 
This trigger's been set to permanent default. 
We can try the internal configuration. 
 What's going on? 
 They wiped out the configurations. 
 Can you disarm it? 
 It doesn't look good. 
Team A, this is Bauer. I want you 
to start to clear the north runway. 
 I repeat: clear the north runway. 
 What do you mean? 
If we can't diffuse it, I've gotta get it as far away from LA as possible. 
 Yes, that's affirmative. 
 Roger that. 
What's happening? 
Timing mechanism. 
They must've given it an expedite command. 
When it's tampered with, the countdown speeds up. 
Hold on, hold on, hold on. 
Wait a minute. Don't touch that. It'll detonate. 
What just happened? 
Nothing. This isn't a bomb. 
It's been rigged to look like one. 
 And the radiation reading? 
 Probably the box. 
There was a bomb in here recently, but it's gone now. 
The reading's picking up some plutonium residue. 
All teams, we do not have the bomb. 
This is a decoy. 
I repeat: we do not have the bomb. 
This is a decoy. 
We are still looking for the nuclear device. 
There's no bomb at the airport, Roger. 
If there's something that you haven't told me that could save lives... 
tell me now. 
Please, Roger. 
Ask Sherry. 
What did you say? 
Sherry... is the one you wanna talk to. 
Just got off a conference call with NSA and Division. 
There's a nuclear bomb, under terrorist control, somewhere in Los Angeles. 
It's set to go off at some point today. 
George, where are you going? 
 Bakersfield. 
 Why? 
 I don't have to tell you. 
 You're trying to get outside the blast radius. 
Sir, we have a serious situation. 
Taking time out to coddle the media... 
Once the rumour mill starts, we've got two problems. We don't need mass hysteria. 
My sister is getting married today, Ralph. 
We have to establish whether or not there's a connection between Reza and the terrorists. 
A passport would be ideal. 
You'll be dropped three blocks from the salvage yard. 
We haven't seen Wald come in yet. 
That's Eddie Grant, one of Wald's main go-to guys. 
 You haven't changed much, Jack. 
 What's your point? 
I'm short a man and I'm on a schedule. 
What are we doing? 
Today we're turning a government building into a cemetery. 
 What building? 
 The CTU. 
Kim. Take my keys 
and get her away from here. 
Kim, stop the car. I will kill you. 
Stop the car, Kim. Do not do this. 
I need you to come over here. Right here. 
Wait for me. I'm gonna go get some help. 
Tell me where my daughter is, Kim. 
Megan? Megan? 
Megan! Megan! 
Megan! 
Megan! 
Megan! Megan! 
Have you seen a little girl? Nine, blonde hair? 
I'll be fine, OK? I'll be fine. 
You are Gary Matheson? 
Yeah. 
About time you got here. Where you been? 
We just got the call five minutes ago, sir. 
You're reporting a child abduction? 
It's my daughter. She took my daughter. 
Describe the suspect for me. 
I can do better than that. Her name is... 
Could you stop, please? 
Her name is Kimberly Bauer. 
 She works for my wife and me. 
 I need a description, sir. 
 Mason. 
 It's Tony. How far out of the city are you? 
Why? 
I just got off the line with Steve Lawler from District. 
About what? 
LAPD made a vehicle match with somebody on our watch list. 
 He wants you to check it out. 
 This is coming out of LAPD? Come on. 
Lawler doesn't trust their judgment, so he wants you there. 
Plus he knows it's on your way to Bakersfield. 
I know you're headed out there to follow up on a lead, but Lawler wants this checked out. 
What's the address? 
Before you go to your press conference, Rayburn wanted me to give you this updated damage projection. 
These casualty figures are higher. 
They have all but ruled out dirty bombs and conventional weapons. 
They feel that we are actually dealing with a nuclear bomb. 
Megan! 
Megan! 
Megan! 
Get away from her! Get away! 
Where did you go? I told you to wait. 
Huh? 
I was looking for you. 
Oh, God. OK, OK. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. It's OK. It's OK. 
You're gonna take that building down with three charges? 
It's all in the placement, Jack. 
 Did you guys spread those fuses? 
 Yeah. 
What made you target CTU anyway? 
Why are you asking so many questions? 
 I just wanna know what I'm getting into. 
 Nobody asked you to get into this. 
The time comes, all you gotta do is keep your eyes open and we'll do the rest. 
Whatever you say, Eddie. 
 Yeah. 
 Dad. 
 Did you get my message? 
 Listen to me... 
 I left it on your phone about an hour ago. 
 I lost my phone. Gary flipped out on me. 
Can you find it? 
 Find what? 
 Your phone. 
I'm in trouble. I need you to come get me. 
I can't go to the police with this. 
 Where are you? 
 I'm at a payphone on Spring Street. 
 What's the number? 
 Dad, I want you to come get me. 
I can't do that. 
Why not? 
Why don�t you go to Carol's? 
I'll call you there. 
 Aunt Carol's? 
 Yeah. 
 She lives in San Jose, Dad. 
 I know where she lives. 
Dad, you're acting really weird right now. 
Just go there. 
And for once do what I ask, OK? 
 Who was that? 
 My girlfriend. 
I asked her to pick something up for me. 
She just doesn't listen. 
Tony, Jack Bauer's daughter on line five. 
She sounds pretty freaked. 
 Kim, this is Tony. You all right? 
 I just spoke to my dad. He's acting strange. 
 He pretty much hung up on me. 
 He's on a job, Kim. 
Since when? 
I just saw him a couple of hours ago. 
Maybe I can help you out. 
It's messed up. I have the police after me. 
 Why? 
 I didn't do anything wrong. I've just been... 
Kim? Hello, Kim? 
Hello? 
Kim? The connection's messed up. 
Tell me where you are and somebody'll pick you up. 
 I can't stay here. 
 Can you find a way to CTU? 
Yeah, I guess so. I can take the bus. 
Do that. When you get here 
I'll help you straighten everything out. 
OK. 
Come on. 
There's noise on all the phone lines. 
I tried a filter and I can't get rid of it. 
It may not be our system. 
Today of all days. 
Call the phone company, and switch all priority calls to wireless protocol. 
 You trying to knock out their phone lines? 
 Don't bug me. I'm working. 
We're causing some interference so the phone company sends out a crew. 
Maybe you could go out to the road, Jack. 
Keep an eye out. 
Sure. No problem. 
 CTU operations. Go ahead. 
 Hello? Is this CTU? Can you hear me? 
Hello? Damm it. 
 Northwest Regional. 
 This is Jack Bauer from CTU. 
 I need to speak with the president. 
 Who is this? 
It's Jack Bauer. 
Priority access code 7117A. This is urgent. 
 Hold, please. 
 Please don't put me on hold. 
 Lynne Kresge. 
 I have a Jack Bauer for the president. 
 He has a clearance code. 
 Put him through to me, please. 
 Mr Bauer, this is Lynne Kresge. 
 I need to speak with the president. 
I'm terribly sorry. 
He's with the press corps right now. 
Mr Bauer, hello? 
CTU's phone lines are down. 
I need you to get them an urgent message. 
What is it? 
CTU, Los Angeles, is going to be blown up within the hour. Wald's group is doing it. 
 Is this the nuclear bomb? 
 No, it is not the nuke. 
But you need to evacuate CTU and you need to alert a bomb squad. 
 There are at least three charges on the... 
 Jack. 
All set, Jack. 
I applaud Governor Schulman's efforts to protect Oregon's endangered species. 
His work with the Natural Resources Defense Council has created a new paradigm... 
Wald's crew is planning to blow up CTU, Los Angeles. 
It is a non-radiological attack, and it is happening within the hour. 
 Where'd you get this? 
 Jack Bauer. 
They wanna cripple CTU's investigation, divert attention away from the major strike. 
 I agree. 
 Has Bauer contacted CTU? 
He couldn't get through. 
Phone lines are down. 
 Somehow we have to warn CTU. 
 No, we don't. 
 We can't. 
 What are you talking about? 
If Wald's crew fails, they'll think somebody tipped off CTU. 
They'll figure out it was Bauer. 
Are you seriously suggesting we just let these people at CTU die? 
 Jack Bauer gave specific instructions. 
 Why isn't he stopping them? 
Because he knows he's gotta keep his cover intact. 
He knows if he's exposed he can't get to Wald and we lose our only chance to find the nuke. 
 This is the president's decision. 
 He's telling the press it's business as usual. 
We've already detained Ron Wieland illegally. 
We can't muzzle the entire press corps. 
 We still have to tell the president. 
 We will. When he's in a position to hear it. 
 It will be too late by then. 
 Lynne, this is my call. 
I don't work for you. 
 Jenny Dodge. 
 It's Lynne. I need to speak to the president. 
 He's in a press conference. 
 I don't care. This is urgent. 
 I want to speak with him now. 
 OK. I'll try to get to him. 
Hey, look at this. 
Someone cut the chain. 
Get on the radio to Dispatch and have them send security. 
Who are you? 
Don't move. Don't move! 
What's your name? What's your name? 
Look at me. What's your name? 
 Cam Strocker. Is that your name? 
 Yeah. 
Cam, look at me. You wanna live, Cam? 
Cam. 
 Cam. Cam. You wanna live? 
 Yeah. 
This is what you�re gonna do: call your boss, tell him you need an on-site systems check at CTU headquarters. 
Got that? 
Can you do it? Can you do it? 
That's a good answer. 
It's Eric Rayburn from NSA. 
Mr Rayburn? This is Tony Almeida. 
I understand you're the ranking agent on site. 
Is that correct? 
 Yes, sir, it is. 
 Then I need you to execute an order. 
Of course. 
I want you to copy and transfer your database onto our server, anything related to the nuclear threat. 
 Did you hear me? 
 Yes, sir, I did. May I ask why? 
It's precautionary, given the extraordinary threat we're facing today. 
 But I would like it done sooner than later. 
 How soon? 
By 11. 
The earliest I could get that done is by noon. 
 You have until 11. 
 Sir, that may not be enough time. 
Then you probably should get started. 
Thank you, sir. 
 Paula. 
 Yeah. 
 I need to pull you off your SIM analysis. 
 I'm almost done. 
I want you to sort and send data to the NSA server, everything relevant to the nuke, OK? 
 When do you need it done? 
 Right now. 
I'm gonna have to generate a fresh encryption code. 
 I'm gonna need to use Mr Mason's office. 
 Just do it, please. Thank you. 
Tony, what's going on? 
First the phone lines go down and then NSA puts in a rush order for us to transfer all our data on the nuke? 
He says it's precautionary. 
Then he would have issued the same order to every other agency. 
 Look into that, would you? 
 Yeah. 
How you doing? George Mason, CTU. 
Arroyo, LAPD. Barber made a vehicle match 
from the alert you guys put out this morning. 
 Have you checked inside? 
 We were about to. 
Our captain made us stand down until you got here. 
Relax, Sergeant. I wanna be here 
even less than you want me here. 
Hello? 
What's this? 
Nice. 
You OK in there? 
We got a man down in here. 
Get out of the building! 
Get out of the building! 
Call Hazmat and have them set up a quarantine. 
I think we got a hot zone. 
You OK? 
Yeah? 
Does your mom cry a lot? 
I don't have a mom. 
Where is she? 
She passed away. 
But you have a dad, right? 
Do you make him mad? 
Sometimes. 
I always make my dad mad. 
No, when your dad gets mad, it's not because of you. 
 But he always says it is. 
 Well, he's wrong. 
I promise you he's wrong. 
Everything's gonna be OK, Megan. 
I'm never gonna let him hurt you again. 
You know the drill. 
How's it going? 
 I'm doing a system check and line repair. 
 Let me see your work order. 
My office just called a few minutes ago. 
They spoke with McKendrie. 
He says you got some serious noise on your lines. 
 Let me see your ID. 
 Sure. 
You're doing fine, Cam. 
Isn't he, Jack? 
Yeah, he's doing great. 
 Is the back open? 
 It's just my crew back there. 
I still need to look. 
Go ahead. It's open. 
 There's a lot of you. 
 It's a big job. 
It's all clear. 
All right. Go ahead. 
Have your IDs ready for security up ahead. 
This isn't a bank. 
There's nothing to steal here. 
 We're not stealing anything. 
 Then why are we here? 
We're taking back our country. 
From who? Who are you people? 
Jack, tell him who we are. 
We're patriots. 
Kate, it's for you. 
Some guy named Ralph Burton. 
Thanks. 
So who is he? A new boyfriend? 
Maybe. 
Why can't I ever get a straight answer out of you? 
Can you just give me the phone? 
 Hello. 
 Kate. 
Did you check the passport information I gave you? 
I'm afraid it confirms that Reza Naiyeer has had contact with Syed Ali. 
What does that mean? 
Are you saying Reza's a terrorist? 
The authorities need to determine that. 
 Authorities? What authorities? 
 I had to alert homeland security, Kate. 
Are they gonna arrest him? 
I'm not sure yet, but until I hear from them, please keep this to yourself. 
I have to tell my sister. 
You can't tell her or anyone else about this until you hear from me again. 
 I don't believe this is happening. 
 I know it's hard, but just try to act normal. 
My sister is marrying someone who works with terrorists and you expect me to act normal? 
You could endanger yourself and your family if you let on that anything is wrong. 
Kate. 
Yeah. I understand. 
Kate. 
 Come with us. 
 Not right now. 
My cousin Sanjar just arrived. We wanted you 
to meet him before he headed to the hotel. 
 I can meet him later. 
 You'll probably recognise him. 
 He was at Stanford the same time you were. 
 He's cute. 
No, really. No! I said no! 
Kate, what is your problem? 
I'm sorry, Marie. I just... 
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. 
What did you mean? 
You've been acting really weird all morning. 
What is it, Kate? Tell me, what's going on? 
You're my little sister. 
And I love you so much. 
And... I just want you to be happy. 
That's it. 
Well, then, be happy for me, OK? 
That'll make me happy. 
Because this is gonna be the best day of my life. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 No crying. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm getting married. 
 I know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
 Jenny. 
 Yes? 
I told you I need to speak to the president. 
I have to draft a statement anticipating the nuclear event. 
 Why haven't I heard from him? 
 He's on camera. 
I told you this was urgent. 
You should have slipped him a note. 
I did. I'm sure as soon as the president 
can extricate himself, he'll call you. 
Let's get those portable units in here now. 
Looks like this lead turned out to be real. 
Some kind of lab where they may have assembled the nuke. 
 Based on what? 
 They found radioactive material. 
What kind of radioactive material? 
They're still doing field analysis on it. 
Was anyone exposed? 
All of them in the bag. 
They're putting us through decon now. 
Precautionary measure. 
We have three dead bodies. I'm gonna 
send you photos and fingerprints on 'em. 
See if they match anybody on our watch list. 
 Your phone, sir. 
 I'm gonna have to get back to you. 
George, look, NSA ordered us to send them our case database. 
Paula's already on it, but I sense they're keeping us out of the loop on something. 
They're consolidating data from all agencies. 
That's just it. 
We're the only agency they've asked. 
Sir, the phone. 
Tony, I gotta go. Call Chapelle. 
Tell him what you just told me. 
See what he can find out for you. I gotta go. 
 George, you sure you're OK? 
 I'm fine. 
I need all your clothes off. 
You're not even gonna buy me dinner? 
Check him over at hoses. 
Easy, guys. I like my skin. 
Try and leave some on. 
Did you finish exporting those files to Division? 
No, it's in process now. As soon as they 
finish uploading, I'll send an encryption key. 
Paula, are you all right? 
Yeah. 
I was a little nervous before, but Tony said everything's probably gonna be OK. 
I grew up in LA, you know. 
My whole family is here, my friends are here. 
So if this bomb goes off, that just means all of a sudden everyone's gonna die? 
No. No, not necessarily. 
It depends on a lot of things. 
Yeah, that's probably right. 
Well, I should check the upgrade. 
Paula. 
Are you gonna be OK? 
I guess so. I'm really scared, 
but there's nothing I can do about it, right? 
It's fine, Michelle. 
 You gonna kill me too? 
 Not today. 
Just relax. Just relax. I'm not gonna hurt you. 
I'm trying to stop this thing. I need your help. 
Two cars over there's a large grey SUV. I want 
you to hide under it and wait until we go. 
After we've gone, I want you to take this back into the building. 
Go to security, ask for Tony Almeida. 
It'll show him where all the bombs are located. He'll know what to do. Now go. 
What are you talking about, man? 
Who are you? 
I'm a government agent. I'm undercover. 
You work for the government? 
And you let them kill Danny? 
 It happened before I could stop it. 
 You son of a bitch! 
Listen to me. Listen to me. 
I'm sorry about your friend. I am. 
But we are in a very serious situation, so you better get your ass under that car right now. 
These guys'll be back in a minute. 
If you're still here they will kill you. 
I won't be able to stop them. 
Do you understand? 
The lives of everyone in this building are at stake right now. 
So, please, get that message to Tony Almeida. 
Come on, go. 
Where's your boy, Eddie? 
Jack? Jack? 
Jack. 
What happened? Where's the guy? 
Look at me. Jack. 
What happened? 
Jack, look at me. What happened? 
 I don't know. 
 Where's the telephone guy? 
I don't know. I was looking out 
like you asked me to, and the next thing I know you're slapping me in the head, Eddie. 
What are you telling me, Jack? 
Are you saying you let the son of a bitch go? 
 I didn't tie him up. 
 Are you saying it's my fault? 
Do you believe this guy? He walks in 
off the street, breaks Dave's ankle... 
Back off! Back off. 
Shut up. Jack, get in the front of the van. 
Get in the front of the van. We got seven 
minutes until this building goes down. Get in. 
Hi. 
My name's Kimberly Bauer. 
Tony Almeida is expecting us. 
OK. He'll take care of you. 
 Where are we? 
 Don't worry. We're safe here. 
 How much time have we got? 
 Four minutes. 
Unless the phone guy already pulled the alarm. 
Leave it alone. 
The press conference ended five minutes ago. 
The president was supposed to call me the minute, very minute that he... 
What are you doing? 
It was you. You told Jenny 
to keep the president away from me. 
I spared the president from a no-win situation. 
The people did not elect you to make that choice, Eric. 
 It's too late. 
 Maybe not. 
 Get out of my way. 
 Don't do this, Lynne. 
You do not want me for an enemy, I promise. 
 Are you threatening me? 
 Just giving you some strong advice. 
What's going on? 
Jack Bauer called. He said that 
Wald's crew is planning to blow up CTU. 
It's a non-nuclear strike, which suggests that it's a secondary target. 
 When? 
 We're not sure. Bauer got cut off. 
 Have you called CTU? 
 That's what we were debating. 
Debating? 
Right now Wald is our only thread to finding the nuke. But Bauer hasn't got to Wald yet. 
If we stop Wald's crew, they may realise it was Bauer that turned them in. 
In the meantime, I'm having CTU transfer their intel so our only losses would be infrastructure and personnel. 
Those losses are unacceptable. 
Contact CTU immediately. 
Yes, sir. 
 Think I'm making a mistake? 
 I do, sir. 
Tony. That guy over there, 
he's asking to see you. 
He claims he was taken hostage by these men that wanna blow up CTU. 
He said there are bombs planted here, here and here. I'll have a squad check it out. 
 Order an evacuation. 
 We don't know... 
This is why NSA wanted us to transfer over our database. 
They knew we were being targeted and didn't say a thing. We have to evacuate now. 
Everyone, listen up. 
This is Lynne Kresge. I'm calling 
to tell you about a possible threat to CTU. 
We just found out about it. 
NSA knew about this a half an hour ago. 
 That's why Rayburn wanted our files. 
 Right now get your people out. 
I want you to go down this hallway and calmly clear everyone out. 
 What's going on? 
 We're evacuating. 
 I'm looking for Tony Almeida. 
 I'm sorry. We've gotta go right now. 
35 seconds. 
I need you to move a little faster. 
No, leave your things behind! 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm almost done with the encryption. 
 Leave it! There's a bomb! 
 We can't lose this data! 
Would you leave it? Come on! 
Let's go! Come on, hurry! Hurry! 
 We did it, Jack. 
 Good job, Eddie. Good job. 
We're too late. CTU was just hit. 
 I want Mommy. 
 I know. 
It's OK. 
You're clean. 
Then why so grim? 
The tests are back from the field analysis. 
The substance you inhaled is... 
well, it's plutonium. 
Based on the particle size, atmospheric saturation, length of time you were exposed... 
Cut to the chase, Doctor. 
Your radiation exposure level is high. 
Definitely lethal. 
How much time do I have? 
Could be as much as a week or as little as a day. 
I'm sorry. 
 How long will Prescott detain me? 
 Until after the press conference. 
In two hours he'll announce our response to the bomb and his ascension to president. 
I've done with Bauer. 
He's chasing a trail that leads nowhere. 
We're onto other things. 
You've been reassigned. 
You can't reassign me now. 
You have made yourself a liability I can't afford. 
This is Kim Bauer. I need my dad. 
 What's wrong? 
 I'm at the Mathesons' house. 
Gary's here. He has a gun. He killed 
the policeman that brought me. 
I want you to point the gun at his chest and pull the trigger now. 
 Is he dead? 
 Yeah. 
I'll send someone to pick you up. 
Go downstairs and wait for them. 
I am certain the Cyprus audio has been forged. 
I have in custody the man who engineered it. 
I'll bring him in soon. 
 How will it work? 
 I'll make a recording for them, on the spot. 
Shift it around, reframe segments, same specs as Cyprus. 
 Where are you going? 
 This is taking too long. 
We're the only ones who can help you. 
Without us, you don't stand a chance. 
Alex! 
Alex! 
Thank you. 
 How's Chappelle? 
 Still unconscious, but he's starting to stir. 
The drug I gave him is short-acting. 
He may need more. 
How long can you keep pumping him full? 
Long enough for Jack to deliver Hewitt. 
How are we coming on the chopper? 
It should land at Hewitt's in ten minutes. 
We should have him here in half an hour. 
 Is Carrie asking about Chappelle? 
 Not yet, no. 
Image processing should keep her busy for a while. 
Excuse me, Mr Almeida? 
Brad Hammond from Division wants Mr Chappelle. Do you know where he is? 
No, I'll take it. This is Tony Almeida. 
How can I help you, sir? 
 Where's Ryan? 
 Uh, I'm not sure. 
His office says he arrived at CTU three hours ago. 
 None of your people can find him. 
 He must have stepped out. 
He didn't log out. 
Did he say where he was going? 
Not to me, sir, but I'll let you know as soon as I find him. 
No, you'll tell me what's going on over there. 
I know Ryan Chappelle was going to assess the situation. 
I cannot think why he would be out of contact during a national crisis. 
Mr Hammond, I'm sorry, I've told you all that I know, sir. 
I'll make sure Ryan calls when he returns. 
 You do that. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 What's goin' on? 
 Division knows something's up. 
 So what are we gonna do? 
 Get Alex Hewitt here as quickly as possible. 
Alex! 
Alex! 
Alex, if you don't come with me, Kingsley will kill you. You know that! 
I just did what they told me. 
I didn't know what was gonna happen. 
Your only way outta this is to let me take you into CTU. 
You can cut a deal, testify! 
Alex, you're gonna have to trust me! 
Alex! 
Alex! Stop running! 
Alex! 
Alex, listen to me. 
A chopper's on its way to take us to CTU, where no one can hurt you. 
Please, Alex. Help me stop this war 
and I will help you stay alive, I promise. 
Please. 
Alex! 
Stop, damn it! 
I know the oil stocks closed high in Hong Kong last night, Max, but remember, once the president announces the war, the margins will change dramatically. 
 Prices will spike immediately. 
 It's still worth acquiring shares. 
 Do we still have our problem? 
 That'll be taken care of. 
 This must go smoothly. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 I have to go. 
 OK. 
 What'd you get? 
 All the recordings and data. 
But no Hewitt? 
We got there as soon as we could, but I had no lead time. 
Everything, including Hewitt, was meant to have been vaporised last night. 
I won't let some pimply-faced techie ruin everything that we've planned. 
If he gets brought in and testifies, there's gonna be no place for any of us to hide. 
Alex! 
Alex! There's nowhere left to run. It's over. 
All right. You... you promise I'll be safe? 
I give you my word. 
Alex, drop the gun! Drop the gun! 
If you try to shoot me, I will have to shoot you back, and I won't miss. 
And I don't wanna do that. 
I can't stop this war without you, Alex. 
Please, drop the gun. 
Please, drop the gun. 
Alex, you're a smart guy. Think this through. 
I am the only guy that can get you through this alive. 
Please, drop the gun. 
Drop the gun. 
 Alex... 
 You shot me! 
 You shot me! 
 It's gonna be all right. 
No! 
Alex, Alex... Can you hear me? 
OK, stay calm. Don't move. 
You're gonna be all right. 
 What happened? 
 You fell. 
Alex, stay with me. 
I want you to keep your eyes open, OK? 
Just keep your eyes open. OK... 
 Agh! 
 You're OK. 
The bullet didn't hit an artery. 
The chopper should be here soon. 
 You're not gonna bleed to death. 
 It hurts. 
I'm gonna get you something for the pain as soon as we get on the chopper. 
Is there any other part of your body besides your leg that still hurts? 
No, not really. 
OK, good. It looks like you got lucky. 
You're gonna be fine. 
My head... feels wet. 
Just relax. Try and relax. 
Just put your head down. 
OK. 
I gotta make a phone call, OK? 
I'm not goin' anywhere. Stay with me. 
Come on. 
 Almeida. 
 It's Jack. Hewitt's been hurt. 
I need medical assistance on the roof now. 
There's no EMT on the chopper, but there's a med kit. Can you handle it? 
I don't know. I hope so. 
Look, I gotta get back to this. 
 Wait. 
 What? 
You may not be able to contact me after this. 
 Why? 
 Chappelle became a problem. 
I had to take him out of play, and they're onto me. 
 They'll take me out soon. 
 Who do I contact if I need help? 
Michelle is setting up an off-site station. 
She'll do what she can by remote access. 
She'll be on her closed cell, channel B, node 12-12. 
 B, node 1212. I got it. 
 Good luck. 
Thanks. 
Alex, how you doin'? 
This'll get you into the van. 
 How will I breakthrough the firewall? 
 This has a range of a few blocks. 
It's Huffman encoded. It'll get you in. 
Give me a call when you're set, all right? 
 Michelle. 
 Hi. 
 Where are you going? 
 I'm going out to my car. 
 Are you leaving? 
 No. 
I'm just getting something. 
Is there a problem? 
 Have you seen Chappelle? 
 No. 
I've looked everywhere and I can't find him. 
If I see him, I'll tell him you're looking for him. 
And if you don't see him? 
What's that supposed to mean? 
My job is to monitor communications around here. 
 You don't think I know what's goin' on? 
 Why don�t you tell me, Carrie? 
You called Chappelle in to see Rudin. 
I just talked to Rudin. 
 He doesn't know anything about it. 
 Well, of course he told you that. 
His system wasn't loaded properly and it was your fault. 
He wanted to see Chappelle to complain about you. 
Stay out of my business, Carrie. 
You'll do a better job. 
Brian. How did you find out about me? 
The Attorney General said you'd want me for your counsel. 
 What have they told you? 
 You'd been removed from office under the 25th Amendment. 
 Is what they did legal? 
 Technically, yes. 
The cabinet can declare the president incompetent without further definition or clarification. 
 That also gives me the right to appeal. 
 Yes, which I will do vigorously. 
 Unfortunately, it's a lengthy process. 
 We don't have time. 
 I don't know how to make it go any faster. 
 None of those legalities matter. 
We're about to go to war based on evidence that I am convinced is false. 
No one outside this room believes that. 
The evidence was manipulated by a man named Peter Kingsley. 
I need you to find out all you can about him. 
Mike Novick's tying my hands. 
Get him to untie them  whatever you have to do. 
Yes, sir. 
 Almeida. 
 I'm in place. 
 Where are you? 
 I'm in the north lot. 
Van 15a. Listen, Tony, Carrie's onto us. 
 She was asking about Chappelle. 
 What did you tell her? 
That I didn't know anything, but we need her out of the way. 
 Keep her occupied. 
 OK, I'll handle it. Get ahold of Jack. 
I gotta go. Hammond's here. 
 Mr Hammond. 
 Tony. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I told you on the phone. 
I think there�s a problem here. 
Where's Ryan Chappelle? 
 I haven't seen him yet, sir. 
 I see. 
Two of you take this side. 
I want this section covered. 
 What are you doin'? 
 I'm locking you down. 
We're in the middle of preparing a domestic response to this war. 
That's not what I heard. I heard you were 
supporting a rogue agent against orders. 
 Where'd you hear that? 
 One of your people. 
Let's go. Cover every square inch of the place! 
 I'm aware of that. 
 That flyover space is critical. 
 Will David help us? 
 I don't know. 
Mike. 
I don't see us having much success with him. 
 We need this, Mike. 
 Yes, sir, I'll try. How is he? 
David is convinced his decision to hold off on the bombers was correct. 
He'll appeal his removal from office. 
 The 25th Amendment gives him that right. 
 We'll prove we're being manipulated and that the Cyprus recording was falsified, plus we now think we know by whom. 
 I'm listening. 
 A man named Peter Kingsley. 
He's got ties to oil interests both here and abroad. 
Have you found anything to connect him to the Cyprus recording, or the bomb? 
No. We won't be able to without 
access to the Intelligence database. 
David's locked down until we've gone public with the military action. 
 By then it'll be too late. 
 I'm sorry. 
Mike, wait. Just hold on a second. 
I remember when you signed up for David's first run at the Senate over 20 years ago. 
That's... that's a lot of history 
to just throw out the window. 
Come on, Mike. 
I know you just did what you thought was right, but let him try to prove his case. 
You owe him that. 
I'll have Colleen set up a computer station for you. 
You won't be able to transmit outgoing messages. 
That's fair enough. 
 What's in here? 
 A holding room. No one's in there now. 
All right. 
 And this? 
 The other holding room. 
It shouldn't be locked. 
 What's wrong? 
 Someone must have reconfigured the lock. 
Come on, Alex. Keep talking to me. 
Everything's... a little blurry. 
What's happening to me? 
Nothing. You just banged your head. 
It's gonna be all right, OK? 
You just hang in there. 
Alex, I can hear 'em. They're coming, OK? 
Help's on the way. Just hang in there, OK? 
I've located the CTU chopper that Tony Almeida sent to Jack Bauer. 
They're landing. 
Would you like them to detain Bauer? 
No, I don't wanna waste any more resources on him. 
Just get the chopper back here. 
Mr Chappelle wants you to come back now. 
 We're about to land. 
 I know. 
 I can see him... 
 Just do it. 
What are you waiting for? 
 I'm putting her down. 
 No, cancel that. 
Land the chopper now! 
What are you doing?! 
Land the damn chopper! 
My witness is gonna die! Land! 
Your orders are to pick us up! Pick us up now! 
Damn it! 
 Dessler. 
 The chopper won't pick us up. 
 Hammond's locked us down. 
 I don't give a damn! 
Get me that chopper back! Hewitt is dying! 
Alex. 
 Want me to deal with Almeida? 
 No, Brad, thanks. I'll take care of him myself. 
 Michelle, it's me. 
 Jack, where are you? 
Going back to Hewitt's loft. Set up and 
be ready to interface with his computer. 
 What about Hewitt? 
 He didn't make it. He's dead. 
I'm sorry. 
Call me when you're ready. 
 Yes? 
 I need to speak with you. 
It concerns national security. 
As I am not the commander in chief any more, that's irrelevant. 
We have a problem with the Turkish government. 
Our Stealth bombers are nearing their airspace, but one of their fighter patrols spotted them a few minutes ago. 
Ask the prime minister for the flyover. 
He should agree. 
The secretary of state has spoken to him. 
 He'll grant us this under one condition. 
 What's the condition? 
He wants a personal request and assurances from the president. 
The prime minister doesn't know I've been removed from office. 
He couldn't be told before the American people. 
That wouldn't be right, would it, Mike? 
Now that the bombers have been spotted, it's critical that they get to their targets quickly. 
Any detour will take them over unfriendly skies. 
You want me to speak to the prime minister, under the pretence that I'm still the president? 
Yes. 
This mission is going to continue regardless, sir. 
This phone call, no matter how distasteful, could prevent those planes from being attacked. 
We only have minutes, sir. 
Why did you leave me like this? 
I've been stabbed! 
Let me look at it. 
Be careful. 
You're lucky. The wound's superficial. 
The bleeding's already stopped. 
I'll get you a clean bandage for it. 
 Where's Alex? 
 He fell. He's dead. 
Oh, my God. What happens now? 
You are going to help me. 
Just put this right here. 
 Help you do what? 
 We got one last play. 
 To deliver Kingsley. 
 No. 
He's far too dangerous, and you'll never get close to him. 
You're right. I won't, but you will. 
Kingsley doesn't know Hewitt's been killed. 
If you say you can deliver him, that should get his attention. 
Kingsley has evidence that will implicate me. There is no way... 
Mrs Palmer, you... 
What? 
It's nothing. I'm fine. 
Don't tell me it's nothing. What's going on? 
My heart stopped when Kingsley's men were interrogating me. 
Your heart could be damaged. 
You need to get to a doctor. 
We need to get Kingsley first. 
Mrs Palmer, you are going to help me. 
I'm not gonna give you another choice. 
You wouldn't dare hurt me. 
Make no mistake about it. 
I will do what I have to do. 
What do you want me to do? 
Tell Kingsley you'll exchange Hewitt for any evidence that incriminates you. 
He'll want proof that I have Hewitt. 
 He'll get it. 
 How? 
Hewitt's gonna talk to him. 
At this point, we can assume the chip containing the source recordings has not landed in government hands. 
Did you intercept the federal agent who was in possession of the chip? 
No. But since the bombers are still on course, 
we can assume that he wasn't able to deliver it to the president. 
Which leaves Hewitt as the last remaining loose end. Where are we on finding him? 
I have several teams out looking for him. 
He cannot be allowed to talk. 
Not now, nor ever. 
Hewitt will be found, and he'll be eliminated. 
Clean this up, Peter. 
Go over it again, even if you need to pull a couple of agents in to help you. 
I don't need to tell you you're under arrest. 
 Where's Michelle Dessler? 
 She knew nothing about this. 
She called me to the room where you drugged me. 
She didn't know what I was gonna do. 
I need to issue a warrant. 
Contact local police, issue a memo. 
 I can find her. 
 How? 
This whole thing's been about helping Jack Bauer. She's doing that somewhere off-site. 
 How do we find her? 
 Track her access code. 
See if she's logged onto the CTU computer network. 
 Then do it. 
 Right away. 
Put him in Holding 2. 
 Yeah? 
 I'm connected to his computer. 
Press "escape" and I can take control. 
 Done. 
 What did Hewitt tell you? 
He had a program that could recreate anybody's voice. 
With a voice sample, he could get it to say anything. 
He kept all the audio files in a main file. 
All right, I think I've found it. 
I've never seen this. 
Samples connect through an integrator. 
 I need anything with Hewitt's voice on it. 
 All right, hold on. 
I'm gonna need Berkeley and Wilkerson at that lunch. 
 Is that him? 
 No, damn it. 
There's hundreds of files. Hold on. 
Mrs Palmer, when did you call Hewitt? 
 Last night, around midnight. Why? 
 He might have recorded it. 
Michelle, can you filter the audio files by time and date? 
Let me see... Yeah. 
Find an audio file that was recorded late last night or early this morning, around midnight. 
This must be it. 
 Hello? 
 Alex Hewitt? 
 Who's this? 
 That's him. 
 Sherry Palmer. 
 We have to let it run. 
What are you calling me for? 
I know all about your relationship with Peter Kingsley. 
I don't know him. 
I also know you had all his phone conversations recorded. 
Let me ask you. Was that to protect 
yourself or to blackmail him? 
It's OK, Alex. 
 I'm here to help you. 
 Who says I need help? 
Peter thought you�d die in Los Angeles with everybody else today. 
Now that you haven't, he's gonna come after you. 
So listen to me, and I can protect you. 
We have enough material to create a phonetic template. 
 Good. What do we do? 
 Open up a.gen file 
and type in the phrases we want voiced. 
What do you mean, open a.gen file? 
He created a separate module for playback. 
We have to find what menu it's under. 
 What am I looking for? 
 It's not here. 
Try a subroutine called Prologue. 
 It's this one. 
 They've found me, Jack. 
It's loading. What am I looking for now? 
A playback graphic interface. 
They're almost here. 
 Come out of the van! 
 Hold on, Michelle. Hold on. 
 Ma'am, hands off the keyboard. 
 I've got it. Michelle! 
 Do we take her in? 
 Michelle! 
Affirmative, Central. She's in custody. 
 Hello, Heather. 
 Mr President. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's all right, Heather. 
 Mr President, we're ready. 
 David. 
I realise how awkward this is. 
I hope Mike has told you how much we appreciate your help. 
Make no mistake. I believe 
you're making a gross and tragic error. 
I'm doing this for the men in those planes. 
We're ready here. Patch in the prime minister. 
 Mr Prime Minister. 
 Hello, Mr President. 
I've been trying to reach you for some time. 
Kim? 
Kim! 
Hello? 
Hello? 
Kim? 
Kim? 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Kate Warner. 
Your father sent me to come get you. 
How do I know that? 
OK. 
You shot a man who came in here to attack you. It was self-defence. 
Your father, Jack Bauer, called me, asked me to come get you, take you to CTU. 
How else would I know all of that? 
How do you know my dad? 
Do you work at CTU? 
No. My family was involved 
with what happened today. 
Why would my dad send someone he'd just met to come get me? Huh? 
He trusts me. 
Come on, Kim. 
It's OK. 
The sooner we leave, the sooner you and your dad can be together, OK? 
What do you think they�ll charge us with? 
They could push for treason if they wanted to. 
Think they will? 
Depends on how big of an example they wanna make of us. 
Look, Michelle... 
no one can prove that you knew what I was gonna do to Chappelle. 
I'm gonna tell them that you were helping Jack under my orders, all right? 
No. 
What do you mean, no? 
I did what I thought was right. 
I still believe that. 
And I won't let you lie for me. 
David... 
Thank you. I know how difficult 
it must have been for you. 
How much longer will Prescott keep me here? 
Until after the press conference. 
I've requested you be released sooner, but there's only so much I can do. 
I spoke to Brian. He requested some 
low-security access on your behalf. 
I wanted you to know I granted it. 
So what's going on with you and my dad? 
Excuse me? 
Out of everyone he could have called, he called you. 
There's gotta be a reason. 
I don't think he trusts very many people. 
He trusts you. 
 Is it true you guys just met today? 
 Yesterday really, but yeah, it is. 
I don't resent it or anything. 
I just... want him to be happy. 
It's been a long time. 
Since you lost your mother? 
Yeah. 
I lost my mother too. 
When I was about your age. 
I really don't think I can do this. 
You'll do fine. Just tell him everything 
I told you to say. Make the call. 
Understood. 
Still no sign of Hewitt. 
Yes? 
It's Sherry Palmer, Peter. 
 Are we on a secure line? 
 Of course we are. 
I want the tapes that you made of our conversation, the original DATs. 
 Why would I give you those? 
 Because I'll give you Alex Hewitt in return. 
 You've found Hewitt? 
 That's right. 
Where is he? 
Don't insult my intelligence. 
Agree to the exchange, then you can do whatever you want with him. 
I want to talk to him. 
You'll have to hold on. My bodyguard 
has him restrained in the next room. 
All right, Alex, you can talk. 
It's not what you think. They came in here 
with guns and threatened to kill me. 
I didn't tell them anything about you, I swear, please. 
Who's been there, Alex? 
Who have you told about this? 
 Do we have a deal or not? 
 Not until I know what's going on there. 
Give me Alex back. 
I'm not gonna keep this call going on so that you can trace it. Is it yes or no? 
Look, this is an ultimatum, Mrs Palmer. 
You put Alex back on, or this conversation is ended. 
You force my hand and I'll make sure Hewitt tells his story to as many people as possible. 
It's your final chance, Mrs Palmer. 
Then it's goodbye, Peter. 
Fine. 
Let's do this. 
 Neutral ground. 
 All right. 
LA Coliseum, gate 18, 30 minutes. 
 Just you and Alex. 
 All right. 
Very good work, Mrs Palmer. Let's go. 
Sherry Palmer has Hewitt. 
What does she want? 
I get this feeling I'm being set up. 
Hewitt's just the bait to draw me out into the open. 
So what are you gonna do? 
I don't have any choice. 
I have to play this out. 
Scott'll have shooters in place. 
Sherry Palmer and whoever else she's involved with in this won't leave there alive. 
And then... I'm heading outta the country. 
Time to roll things up around here. 
Now. 
Is there anything I can do for you? 
You've already done so much. 
I'll see you in Lisbon next week. 
I am enormously grateful. 
 What support will you get from CTU? 
 As of now, none. 
Wait. You don't expect to take Kingsley down 
by yourself? That's insane! 
When Kingsley incriminates himself, CTU will help. 
 By then it'll be too late. 
 Sorry, that's how it's gonna be. 
Kingsley will have people with him who will kill us when they realise we don't have Hewitt. 
 You OK? 
 I'm fine. 
 No, you're not. Pull over. 
 We don't have time. 
We've gotta keep moving! 
Jack? Jack! 
 Agh! 
 Jack! 
Jack Bauer just called with some new information. 
He has evidence the Cyprus recording is counterfeit. 
I'm calling off the attack. 
Stopping and restarting military action could cost tens of thousands of American lives. 
An acceptable risk if the alternative is waging war against three innocent countries. 
What do you know about Section 4 of the 25th Amendment? 
If the majority of his Cabinet feels he's unfit to fulfil his duties, the president could be removed from office. 
And the vice president becomes acting president. 
As far as I'm concerned, it's Prescott who should be charged with treason. 
 I was afraid you'd say that, Lynne. 
 Mike! 
Until you hear from me, do not let her out. 
I can lure them away from here. 
You and Kate get the chip over to CTU. 
Meet me at Moorpark and Vineland. If I'm not 
there in 15 minutes, get it to Tony Almeida. 
Yusuf! Behind you! 
He's a damn towel head. 
Stop it! 
We got the evidence that proves the Cyprus audio was forged. 
It's a memory chip containing the original source recordings. 
Do not kill him until he talks. 
Jack, I need the chip. 
It's not for sale. My answer's final. 
When Ronnie's finished, you'll give me another. 
The chip, Jack. 
He's dead. 
If you are just joining us, the White House has confirmed the blast in the Mojave Desert that occurred four hours ago at10.59pm PST 
was in fact a nuclear explosion. 
We'll stitch you up and get you out of here and on your way. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Looking for epinephrine. 
This is a treatment room. I have a patient... 
 Where's the epinephrine? 
 Storage room. 
Let's go. 
Clear. 
Nothing. 
Go again. Increase the joules. 
You are not gonna die on me, you son of a bitch. 
 That's Kingsley. You talk to him. 
 Yes? 
 Let me talk to Stark. 
 He's a little busy, sir. 
 Did Bauer give you the chip? 
 No, sir. Not yet. 
What's taking so long? 
It's under control. 
What am I hearing in your voice? 
Answer me, Raymond. 
Stark pushed Bauer too far. 
He's flat-lining. 
Whatever he broke, he'd better fix. 
And if Ronnie can't handle it, do it yourself. 
 Where's the epinephrine? 
 The doctor's got it. 
 If you don't revive this man, you're dead. 
 I need your men to put him on the gurney. 
Put him up on the gurney. 
Give him as much as he can take. 
Let's go! Let's go! 
What are you waiting for? Do it! 
Give him the paddles. 
Clear. 
Still in v-fib. 
Hit him again! 
Clear. 
 It's too late. It's not gonna work. 
 Hit him again! 
Clear. 
Come on. Come on. 
I got a sinus rhythm. 
I need a Baxter set and a bag of normal saline. 
What did Kingsley say? 
He said I just got promoted. 
Hey, Jack. 
You thought death would save you. 
You're not gonna die until I kill you myself. 
Now, where is that chip? 
We'll be convening the Cabinet within the hour. 
Does the president have any idea what's going on? 
 I don't think so. 
 It's critical he doesn't find out. 
It's not going to be that easy. 
Lynne Kresge was about to warn him, but I was able to intervene. 
Where is she now? 
I had to put her under guard. 
I know it's difficult. It's difficult for all of us. 
 I just hope we're doing the right thing. 
 Mike. 
Do you think these are the circumstances in which I wish to assume the presidency? 
You know me better than that. 
This country was attacked, with a nuclear weapon. 
And the president will not commit to a military response. 
I hope you're not wavering yourself. 
No. I'm not. 
Good. 
So, your responsibility is to make sure that the Cabinet votes to remove him from office. 
I have a responsibility to make sure the vote takes place, not to manipulate the outcome. 
Poor choice of words. 
But my point is the same. 
You're doing the right thing, Mike. 
History will recognise that. 
 Anything from Jack Bauer? 
 Not that I've heard. 
Mike... 
I know you think delaying a military response is the wrong call. 
Only because you're relying on a single source. 
Jack Bauer says he has evidence that we're being manipulated into this war. 
I have to give him the opportunity to produce the proof. 
If there were anything I could say to make you change your mind... 
There isn't. 
Look, Mike, I know this is an unpopular decision. 
And even though you don't agree either, your standing by me means a great deal. 
Send Lynne into my office. 
She's drafting my statement. 
 I'll see if I can find her. 
 What do you mean? 
She wasn't feeling well. She took 
a few minutes' downtime last I heard. 
That's fine. Let her rest. 
I'll go over it with Jenny. 
Please open this door. Whoever you are, 
you are conspiring against the US president. 
Do you have any idea what that means? 
Hello? 
You have no idea what's at stake here. 
Please open the door! 
Hey, get his wallet. 
 How much? 
 A couple of hundred. 
 Come on. 
 Let's go. 
 What's this? 
 Let's get out of here. 
 Come on! 
 Just take it. Let's go. 
 Get in the car. I'm driving. 
 The chip... 
Wait. Wait! 
You took something from him. It's mine. 
Why are you with him anyway? Only thing 
worse than these bastards is people like you. 
No. No, no, it's not like that. I just need 
that plastic case you took from him. 
 This? 
 Yeah. 
This? What is it? 
It's got information on it. It's not worth 
anything. Please, come on. Give it to me. 
What'll you give us for it? 
I'll pay you. I've got money. 
 How much? 
 It's not here, it's at my house. 
Forget it, Marcus. Let's just go. 
 Where's your house? 
 Hancock Park. 
It's not that far from here. 
Come on. 
Come on. 
Yeah, let's do it. Let's go get your money. 
 First I'm gonna put him out of his misery. 
 No. No! 
 This is for messin' with our country. 
 Oh, please! 
 No! 
 Marcus, man, come on. 
Come on, let's go. 
I'm sorry. All circuits are busy. 
Please try your call again later. 
 Give him more epinephrine. 
 He's already had too much. 
He's strong. He can handle it. 
 Now prepare a syringe of beroglide. 
 Beroglide? It'll collapse his lungs... 
Just do it. 
Now, this beroglide stuff, it's amazing. 
This will paralyse your diaphragm, and you'll slowly suffocate. 
You'll feel like you're drowning, until you tell me where the chip is. 
I already told you, I don't know where the chip is. 
Kingsley wants to talk to you. 
I'll be right back. 
 Help me loosen the rope. 
 What? 
 Help me undo the rope. 
 I can't do that. 
He's on the phone. The other guys are far 
away. They'll just think you're working on me. 
 Please. This is the only chance we've got. 
 He'll kill me. 
He's gonna kill you anyway. 
These men were willing to kill millions of people earlier tonight. 
I am the only chance you've got to get out of here alive. 
We don't have any time. Come on. 
Do it. 
Feed it through the bottom. Hurry. 
Hurry. 
He's coming. 
 What are you doing? 
 I had to disconnect his IV first. 
 Get the beroglide. 
 Yes, sir. 
Start him off with 2cc. 
 Mr Chappelle. 
 Hi. 
 Is Tony in his office? 
 He went to IT. He'll be a minute. 
 What's the status on the phones? 
 Grid's down in most of the city. 
 How about wireless? 
 Cell service is pretty much out too. 
 Are you using Satcom? 
 Yeah. 
Save Satcom for your highest priorities. We're 
sharing it with half a dozen other agencies. 
OK. 
Tony. 
Hey, Ryan. 
Good work. 
Good work on what? 
I know Bauer's trying to change our position on the Cyprus audio. 
 That's not exactly true. 
 Whatever. You don't have to explain. 
I'm just glad you're not letting the tail wag the dog. 
Ryan, uh... 
Jack may not be wrong about this. He's... 
Wait. Wait. I don't wanna hear that. 
We're about to bomb the Middle East into next Wednesday. 
We're supposed to be processing intel to support that. 
 I've got most of my people on it. 
 I want all your people on it. 
Don�t you think we need to eliminate doubt about the authenticity of this recording? 
Your department has already authenticated that recording. 
Don't make me the bad guy here, Tony. 
Mason may have recommended you to direct CTU, but you�ll need my blessing to stay on. 
I assume that's what you want. 
What I want is to do what's right in this situation. 
What's right is to follow the chain of command. 
Put everyone on domestic response. 
No! 
 God damn it! 
 Calm down. 
What do you mean, you can't get through to him? 
 Unreachable? I want him now. 
 I'll try again, sir. 
Aaron? 
 Yes, Mr President? 
 Close the door, please. 
 How many presidents have you worked for? 
 I came in on Reagan's second term. 
I haven't been able to establish contact with my vice president in the last half-hour. 
What do you make of that? 
I wouldn't know how to respond to that, Mr President. 
I just pulled our bombers out of the air, against everyone's recommendations. 
Now my vice president suddenly is unreachable. 
 Should I draw any conclusions? 
 Sir, I'm not qualified to give an opinion... 
Aaron, you've been doing this nearly 20 years. 
You know how the system works. 
Is Prescott planning something behind my back? 
 I'm going 2010, please cover position three. 
 Roger that. 
For what it's worth, I think the choices you've made today have been the right ones. 
 That's not what I asked. 
 There are always those in the administration who feel that delay is a weakness. 
 If enough individuals share this view, then... 
 Aaron. 
Is Prescott coming after me? 
I'm not sure. 
But you have good instincts, sir. 
I'd listen to 'em if I were you. 
 Thank you, Aaron. 
 Yes, sir. 
Max is very unhappy. 
Max can be unhappy. 
We're all entitled to our feelings. 
Peter, spare me your usual metaphysical observations. 
Our entire project depends on military action the president just suspended. 
 For now. 
 Now is all that matters. 
Now you're being metaphysical. 
Peter... 
Palmer won't be able to stand the political pressure from his own administration, let alone the will of the people. 
He's not gonna have any choice but to respond to the nuclear weapon. 
You're assuming that this man Bauer hasn't already delivered proof to his people that the Cyprus audio was false. 
Bauer won't be a problem. 
 Tell me where the chip is, I'll make it stop. 
 You'll kill him. 
No. But he'll wish he'd stayed dead. 
I'm all done playing games with you. 
Now tell me what I wanna know! Tell me! 
 They'll hear you upstairs. 
 Then shut up and close the door! 
Fill the syringe and double the dosage. 
I'll tell you where the chip is. 
Where? 
Again. 
It's in... 
It's in a p... 
What did you say? 
They're taking the chip to... 
They're taking it where? 
Stay down. 
How much longer has he got before he's dead? 
As long as 15 minutes. 
You tell me who was on the other end of that phone, and I'll make it quick. 
Peter... Kingsley. 
 You wanted to see me, sir? 
 Yes. Close the door, please. 
Have a seat, Mike. 
I've been feeling a little disconnected from my people in the last hour. 
I've been managing the Joint Chiefs and Homeland Security. If you want me closer... 
Not you, Mike. Back in Washington. 
 Who? 
 Prescott. 
I think he's avoiding me. 
With what we've gone through in the last 18 hours, he's just being pulled in ten different directions. 
We were, and in some ways still are, on the brink of war. 
I'm the commander in chief. 
When I call, there's only one direction. 
Absolutely. I'll get him 
on the phone right away. 
Do that. Oh, and Mike? 
This statement that Jenny made a pass on, it's not working. 
 What's the problem? 
 The facts aren't updated. 
And I don't think Jenny's been apprised of everything. I want Lynne to go over it. 
Why don�t you give it to me? I'll get it to her. 
Thank you. 
Prescott. 
It's Mike Novick. Can you talk? 
Yeah. 
 Are you going forward or not? 
 Of course. Nothing's changed. 
 The sooner you can execute, the better. 
 We're going as fast as we can here. 
David Palmer is not a stupid man. 
He knows something is going on. 
It won't take him long to figure out what it is. 
 How does he know? 
 For one thing, you haven't returned his calls. 
 I'll call him now. 
 I think that�s a good idea. 
Mike, I'm counting on you. You gotta keep 
him busy until I can get everyone together. 
 How much longer? 
 A halfhour. 45 minutes tops. 
The sooner the better. 
I'm all alone out here on this. 
He's asking about Lynne. 
I can't keep up the act much longer. 
You won't have to. Just hold your mud, Mike. 
 CTU. Dessler. 
 It's Jack. I need to speakto Tony. 
J... Jack? 
Michelle, I don't know if you can still hear me. 
Kate and Yusuf have got the chip. 
I'm going to Vineland and Moorpark, just in case they're still waiting for me there. 
Michelle? 
Damn it. 
Jack? 
Tony? 
 What's up? 
 Call just came through from Jack. 
 What'd he say? 
 We lost the signal. 
 You try him back? 
 Yeah. I put an autotrace on the number. 
See if Dispatch picked it up in the log. 
Find out if it was a cell or land line. 
OK. 
Yes, sir. 
What's that all about? 
Jack Bauer tried to contact us. 
We lost connection. 
I said I don't want Bauer distracting you or your resources. 
Whatever he's doing out there is irrelevant. 
I'm not so sure it is. Jack says he's got proof 
that the Cyprus audio was fabricated. 
 He's bringing it here within the hour. 
 If he's got proof, let him produce it. 
But I want you to keep your eye on the ball, Tony. 
Jim, we both know you've been one of the most outspoken opponents to my decision to call off this attack. 
Any criticisms I may have had have been expressed behind closed doors, out of reach of any public scrutiny. 
I know we haven't had a chance to talk one-on-one since all this began. 
So if you have something to tell me, go ahead. 
There's nothing, sir. 
My door is always open, Jim. 
If you have something to say, I would expect you to bring it to me first. 
 Of course, Mr President. 
 Thanks for getting back to me. 
 I still don't trust him. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 Sorry to interrupt, sir. 
 What is it? 
Lynne Kresge is injured. 
She fell down some stairs. 
 What happened? 
 We're not sure. 
It appears she may have been running from a fire in an upstairs room. 
 Is she OK? 
 Onsite physician says she's critical. 
Show me where. 
So, what'd you find out from Dispatch? 
Well, Jack called me from a cell. Came from 
somewhere between Encino and Studio City. 
OK, so he was in an urgent care centre right around here about two hours ago. 
 To get to CTU he'd take the 101 or the 5. 
 Do you want me to pull up the satellite? 
No, that would raise a red flag with Chappelle, which is the last thing I need. 
What about police channels? If he couldn't 
contact us, maybe he tried someone local. 
Can you monitor those without being detected? 
Yeah. 
 All right. Focus on the downtown precincts. 
 OK. 
Yusuf! 
Jack, they took the chip. 
What are you talking about? Where's Kate? 
They took her to her house. Hancock Park. 
She offered to exchange money for the chip. 
 Come on, let's get you out of here. 
 Jack, I'm not gonna make it. 
 Go and get the chip, Jack. 
 Yusuf, just hang on. Just hang on. 
Yusuf, come on. Yusuf, hang on! 
Yusuf! 
Yusuf, I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
All right, let's go. 
Everybody, be cool. 
 You live here? 
 Yes. 
 By yourself? 
 Yes. 
Damn. 
I don't have my keys. 
 Is this really your house? 
 Yes. 
There's a spare key under the pot. 
 Get inside. Get in here! Shut it off. 
 She's setting us up, man. 
I said, shut it off. Shut it off! 
 What's the code? 
 51224. 
51224. 
Show us where the money's at. 
Doctor, what's her status? 
She sustained neurological damage. We won't 
know the extent till we get her to the hospital. 
 Will she live? 
 It's too early to say. 
 Can I talk to her? 
 That may not be a good idea. 
 I asked the doctor a question. 
 You can try. 
But she's slipping in and out of consciousness. 
Lynne. 
Lynne. 
Lynne, it's me. David Palmer. 
I'm so sorry. 
We're getting you to the hospital, but I need you to tell me how this happened. 
Sir, she took a severe blow to the head. 
She has a concussion and she's not coherent. 
 She's trying to say something. 
 D... D... D... 
It's OK. I'm here. I'm listening. 
What is it, Lynne? 
What is it? 
It's all right, Lynne. 
They're going to take good care of you. 
 We need to get her to the hospital. 
 Go. 
Come on, Tony. Pick up the phone. 
 I'm sorry. All services are busy. 
 Damn it! 
 Chappelle's going to find out. 
 What are you talking about? 
He said not to waste time looking for Jack, but that's all you and Michelle are doing. 
Why aren�t you working on the field intel? 
Don't shine me on. 
I'm trying to help you keep your job. 
Really? By doing what? 
 Not saying anything. 
 OK. 
Then don't say anything. 
Um... 
I want something in return. 
 And what would that be? 
 Michelle worked for me at District. 
Things worked much better that way. 
She's not qualified to be my boss. That's why 
things have been so messed up here tonight. 
So, uh... 
you want Michelle's job. 
Is that what this is about? 
Yes. 
And I assume you wanna keep yours. 
Yeah. 
Mr Chappelle, could you come over here a second? 
What do you need, Almeida? 
Carrie's got something she wants to tell you. 
What is it, Carrie? 
Well? 
Carrie tried to extort a promotion out of me by promising to keep her mouth shut. 
That about right? 
Mouth shut about what? 
He and Michelle are still trying to find Jack Bauer. 
I was trying to give Tony the courtesy of a warning. I was gonna tell you, Mr Chappelle... 
That's enough, Carrie. Get back to work. 
Yes, sir. 
Thought I made myself clear, Tony. 
We're past Bauer. 
No, sir. You are. I'm not. 
I'm director of CTU. I'm allocating resources 
to ensure we have all the facts. 
If you're not comfortable with me making my own decisions, relieve me of my duties. 
That won't be necessary. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Don't thank me. 
I just don't have anyone to take your place right now. 
I don't like insubordination. 
Come on. 
You better hurry up. 
It's there. 
 What the hell is this? 
 There's at least 20,000 euros. 
 Euros? 
 It's European money. 
 I look European to you? Where's the cash? 
 That is cash. It's as good as dollars. 
We want cash money. You understand me? 
Marcus? 
 You think this is real? 
 No, they keep the fake ones locked up 1500. 
 That's it? 
 That's it. 
Now what do we do? 
Look, just take it all. 
Just gimme the chip. 
She knows what we look like. 
She knows our names too. 
 We had a deal. 
 He's right. We can't just leave you here. 
Take everything! I won't tell anyone. 
I won't tell the police, I promise. 
Just give me the chip! 
Don't do this. Let's take the stuff and go. 
The second we walk out of here, she's calling the cops. I can't get locked up again. 
No! 
 No! 
 Gimme that! 
 Kate, are you all right? 
 Yeah. They've got the chip. 
 How many rooms at the end of the hall? 
 Two. Bedroom and bathroom. 
Stay down. 
All I want is the chip! 
My name is Jack Bauer. I'm a federal agent. 
All I want is the chip, and then I'll let you go. 
You shot my friend, man. 
You expect me to believe you? 
Right now you don't have a choice. 
You come in here and I'm gonna smash this thing. I'll put it right under my foot. 
We're looking for Jack Bauer. He was on 
a cellphone between Encino and Studio City. 
We need to find him as soon as possible. 
I need everyone to make this priority one. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we can begin. 
I'd like to thank you for assembling at such short notice. 
I'm sure you're all wondering why I've asked you here, why I've asked you to keep the news of this meeting to yourselves. 
Excuse me, Mr Vice President. 
Shouldn't we wait for the president? 
President Palmer will be joining us later. 
I'm not sure I understand you. 
The first part of this meeting will be a closed session. 
 Closed to the president? 
 I'm afraid that's the point of the meeting. 
To some of you this will come as a surprise. 
For most of you, though, I hope it comes as a relief. 
But it is my sincere belief that, based on his response to today's events, David Palmer is unfit to continue as president of the United States. 
Hey, what are you doing there? 
Max! 
Joshua! 
How'd you get here? 
Did anyone see you? 
It's OK. He's a friend. 
Yeah, sure. 
You just threw me back there, that's all. 
You're Joshua, right? 
Joshua. Right. 
Original Cindy. Good to meet you. 
I'm makin' breakfast. You hungry? 
I was gonna come by and bring you some stuff. 
 Come to find Father. 
 Father? Who's Father? 
Sandeman. He made us. 
He's gonna make Max better. 
Your love-bug thing where you can't touch Logan? 
Well, get on it, boo. 
I'm tired of seeing you mopin'. 
This virus bitch has gotta go down so that you can get busy with your man. 
Max and Logan getting busy. That's the plan. 
The plan is we're gonna find Father. 
Logan's tracking down some leads. 
In the meantime, you gotta lay low. 
You can't be walking around out there. 
Don't mope. I'm on it. 
You want some more? We got more food. 
Down. 
OK. 
Eight dollar. 
Chill, Pop. It wasn't me, I swear. 
Somebody call an ambulance. 
Somebody call an ambulance! 
They designed her to be the perfect soldier, a human weapon. 
Then she escaped. 
In a future not far from now, in a broken world, she is haunted by her past. 
She cannot run. 
She must fight to discover her destiny. 
So then I ran a search of university records. 
So then I ran a search of university records. 
Figured if Sandeman was the genius behind Manticore, he'd probably have some sort of degree in genetics or biochemistry or something. 
 Anything turn up? 
 A couple of PhDs but nothing in sciences. 
 And what about the house? 
 His name wasn't on it. 
Mortgage held by an offshore corporation and the taxes paid from a numbered account. 
If you're splicing genes for a secret government agency, gotta make sure you cover your tracks. 
In May of '08, the bank repo'ed the property after six months of non-payment, and it's sat there empty ever since. 
 Looks like Sandeman just disappeared. 
 Maybe he retired someplace sunny. 
Or he ran for his life. 
We're talking about Manticore. 
The place wasn't exactly known for job security. 
Yeah, well. 
If he had time to pack his bags, he probably would've taken this. 
The Manticore symbol. 
We're sure he's one of the good guys? 
Joshua's sure. That's enough for me. 
Maybe we could check it for prints or DNA. 
 I don't know. After ten years? 
 Worth a shot. 
We got nothing on this guy. 
Not even a first name. 
I'll call Matt Sung. 
See if he can get the police lab to do it. 
We're gonna find him, Max. 
And we're gonna beat this. 
I just want things to be the way they were. 
You know, when we could hold hands without you keeling over on me. 
 Asha. 
 I just got this close to getting busted. 
 Listen... 
 They ran my papers on the computer. 
I knew they were onto them being forged because they took forever. 
So I just got the hell outta there. 
 That's a smart move. 
 All I wanna do is go home and take a bath. 
 Now I gotta find a new fake ID. 
 I can probably help with that. 
We gotta talk about Manticore. 
I'm glad your friend Max and her furry little friends got outta there, but it's really... 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
What I meant was we... My group, that is... 
The S1Ws, the political organisation I was... 
Yeah. Government's saying Manticore was 
just a VA hospital you guys burned down. 
Sorry. From me and all my furry little friends. 
I gotta get to work. Have fun. 
"All I wanna do is take a bath." 
All I wanna do is drown her in one. 
Don't get mad. It's not her fault 
everything handcuffs you to Manticore. 
But what is up? 
Is someone trying to tell me something? 
 Rafer? 
 Lie still. 
 I'm OK. 
 I don't know. You went down pretty hard. 
 That was you? 
 Sorry. You came out of nowhere. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Relax. I'm a paramedic. 
 You deliver pizzas. 
 That was just part time. 
We spent a night together and you think you know me? 
Lie still. 
I gotta check for broken bones. 
Next time you wanna cop a feel, hit me harder and make sure I'm out cold. 
No damage. Just a scratch! 
Max. 
 Matt, did you get it? 
 Yeah, just arrived. 
Listen, I appreciate you doing this. 
No problem. 
I'll send the results as soon as I can. 
No problem. 
I'll send the results as soon as I can. 
Great. 
Biochemist. I'm a scientist. 
I'm sure you got a great team of scientists working at the precinct. 
Hello. The boy that died today 
in Chinatown, I was there. 
I may have been exposed to something. 
The coroner's still investigating. 
We'll have her report tomorrow. 
 I would like to see a copy of that. 
 File a request with the ME's office. 
 This is totally unacceptable... 
 Just follow him. 
 Sung. 
 Yeah? 
You had a sketch artist working on something? 
Yeah. Rumours flying around Chinatown 
about some strange guy in an overcoat. 
I'll say. 
The eyewitness says his face was bleeding. 
Could be the dead kid was exposed to what he's got. 
Could be. 
Let's keep this under wraps until the autopsy comes out. I don't want to start a panic. 
You haven't been in Chinatown lately. 
There's already a panic. 
What happened to you? 
Where you been? 
Been paging you all morning. 
I lost my pager when I got hit on Charles Street. 
 But I'm OK, thanks for asking. 
 Here, hot run. Sector Nine. 
 Can I borrow... 
 No. You're not covered on company bikes. 
If you so much as break a fingernail, we both know you'll sue. 
Let's go! Bip-bip-bip! 
It's called Jam Pony, not Jam Clydesdale. 
Hey. 
OK, you are a paramedic. You trying 
to make me feel bad for not believing you? 
No. I came by to give you this. 
And to see if you wanted to have lunch. 
My way of making up for our little run-in. 
 Listen, I'm really sorry about... 
 Forget about it. 
How can I? I put my foot so far down 
my mouth, I got teeth marks on my knee. 
She must hate me. 
Really, forget about it. 
Eat something. 
I'm not really hungry. 
About what happened that night... 
 I'd rather just forget about that night. 
 Me too. 
I was in a really weird head space. 
I just broke up with my girlfriend, like, three weeks before. 
Anyway, if I came on too strong I'm sorry, cos I'm not like that. 
It's OK. 
I came by a couple of times and no one knew where you were. 
I had to deal with family stuff. 
It's complicated. 
 Family stuff's always complicated. 
 You have no idea. 
Thought maybe you had a boyfriend somewhere. 
That's complicated too. 
Which has gotta be the understatement of the century. 
Max and I danced around each other for almost a year. 
When we finally figure out what's going on between us, this virus thing happens. 
 We can't be together. 
 What do you mean? Why not? 
It's hard to explain. It's like... 
It's too intense. 
Sometimes I think maybe we're just not meant to be. 
Sometimes I think maybe we're just not meant to be. 
I mean, if it's right, why does it have to be so hard? 
I don't know. 
Logan's probably just better off without me. 
I just want you to be happy. 
He'd be lucky to be with you. 
Anybody would be. 
I should go. 
 I'd better get back to work. 
 Yeah, me too. 
You don't have ID. Asha! 
See you around. 
This is your bus ticket, sir. 
Yeah, that mutant. I saw it here yesterday. 
Grabbed a pigeon, bit its head off. 
Looked at me like I was next. 
 It's worse than I thought. 
 What? 
Mutant infestation. They're here as well. 
Were you born dumb or do you put in work? 
Ambulance, we gotta get an ambulance. 
22, all Chinese. 
 What did the ME say? 
 If it's what killed the kid yesterday, it's some kind of pathogen. 
She's never seen anything like it. 
 I mean, is it some kind of toxin or what? 
 She's running tests, trying to figure it out. 
 You see Eyes Only's hack about Manticore? 
 Yeah. Why? 
The government says it never existed, but the word on the street is the place burned down and a bunch of genetically-engineered whatsits got out. 
 Those are just rumours. 
 There's a rumour one's hiding in Chinatown. 
Supposedly deformed, bleeds through his skin. 
 You think they're connected? 
 I don't know. Eyes Only might. 
 Can you talk to him for me? 
 I'll try and get to him. 
 I appreciate it. 
 Sure thing. 
Listen. I'm sorry, Matt. 
 I know this is close to home. 
 Yeah. 
 It was horrible. 
 Those poor people. 
The news said anybody there should get checked for infection. I'm scared. 
Can I talk to you? 
Five minutes, then I start docking. 
Even if there is a screwed-up transgenic, it doesn't mean he's got what killed the people. 
When you were at Manticore, were you aware of any experiments that involved exposure to virulent bacteria or pathogens? 
 No. Why are you jumping to conclusions? 
 Because the guy's been seen in the area. 
If this is linked to me and my furry little friends, why are all the victims Chinese? 
 Manticore's big on equal opportunity. 
 Could be that it takes prolonged exposure. 
If this guy was downtown, maybe it'd be rich white people dying. 
Ever think it was something they ate? 
Or they got bit by the same mosquito? 
Or some bug got loose from a lab? 
Come on, Max! 
This is nothing new to Manticore. Look what 
they did to you and me, for God's sake. 
Just because I'm poison doesn't mean we all are. Your five minutes are up. 
Hold it right there. 
 I love what you've done with the place. 
 Laying low. 
Good, cos it's dangerous out there, especially these days. 
Like it here. Father's books. Father's house. 
Yeah. Listen, about Father. 
Logan's come up empty. 
He's still working on it. 
He'll find Sandeman, just as soon he's done saving the world... 
from us. 
Max and Logan. That's the plan. 
I don't know. 
I'm starting to think there is no plan, and if there is I'm not clued in at all. 
Father ever talk to you about fate? 
You know, like whether some things just weren't meant to be? 
Canine with human DNA not meant to be, then Joshua. 
Max and Logan not meant to be, then getting busy. 
 We'll see. 
 You'll see. 
This virus bitch going down. 
It's him. 
 Hello. 
 If you're calling to apologise... 
I'm not but I will if that's what it takes. 
Spit it out. 
 Asha was heading home and... 
 She left already? 
 Asha was heading home and... 
 She left already? 
Yeah, and she got arrested by sector cops. 
I need your help. 
 You want me to save her? 
 I don't know who else to ask. 
 Try Sung. 
 I did. He's not answering his page. 
 Smart man. 
 If they run her prints and see who she is... 
 Yeah, yeah. Where is she? 
 Sector Four headquarters. 
We'll meet you at Crash in an hour. 
Look, I told you. I left my ID at work. 
I can bring it in tomorrow. 
Your prints came through, Ms Barlow. 
We know you're with the S1W. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
I want the names and addresses of everyone in your group. 
This is crazy. 
This department does not take terrorist activities lightly. 
The S1W are not terrorists. 
Tell me what I want to know or this is going to get ugly. 
I'm gonna kick your ass! 
I'm gonna kick your ass! 
I'm gonna kick your ass! 
It's my thing. Come on. 
You know a girl named Max? 
Hangs out here a lot? 
Yeah, hard to miss but hasn't been in tonight. 
 I'll have a beer. 
 Take that one. 
You know Max? 
 Yeah. You? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. You? 
 Yeah. 
 Rafer. 
 Logan. 
Right. 
Listen. Thanks. 
I know you didn't have to. 
It was a favour to Logan. 
Besides, it wouldn't be right for you to take the rap for something you didn't do. 
You going in? I'm just gonna get 
my ID from Logan and go, so... 
 You're waiting here for Max, right? 
 Yep. 
 That's my cue to go. 
 You don't have to. 
 Things with Logan are screwed up just now. 
 Yeah, but he's crazy about you. 
She digs you, man. I'm just gonna back off. 
Have a seat. 
I don't know how things are gonna play out between us, so I'm gonna go. 
I wouldn't want to mess anything up for her. Neil! 
Yeah? 
 You know Asha? 
 Yeah, I know Asha. 
 I'll give it to her. 
 Great. Thanks. 
See ya. 
Good night. 
Help! Help, help! 
Help! 
Help, help! 
What are you doing here? 
I told you I'd call you. 
 He's clean. 
 Clean? 
Not a trace of the pathogen. 
Let me take a look at that. 
What is that? 
Looks like a tattoo. 
Why do I get the feeling you guys aren't tellin' me something here? 
 What's goin' on? 
 You killed an innocent man. 
That's what's going on. 
 Looked like he was hurting the kid. 
 We know, Matt. 
 Something killed all those people. 
 Lab tests came back today. 
It's not an infectious agent. 
They were exposed to the pathogen directly. 
 Where'd it come from? 
 Don't know. I can tell you this. 
Mother Nature didn't cook this thing up. 
The pathogen's genetically engineered. 
If the pathogen's man-made, then either it escaped from a lab or somebody's exposing people to it on purpose. 
No, don't worry. I got my hands on 
a copy of the ME's report. 
They're chasing their tails. 
I'm ready when you are. 
All I need is a test subject. 
I'll be expecting you. 
He was downstairs people. 
Didn't turn out so good. 
Lives in the basement in case Manticore needs to cut him up for spare parts. 
Finally gets out in the world, and they shoot him dead like he's an animal. 
This is why I'm always on you because it's not safe out there. 
People get real scared when things are different. 
Yeah, but what I forgot to tell you is, when they get scared, they can get really mean. 
I'm sorry. 
There's a rumour going around the black market about a new kind of bio-weapon, capable of distinguishing between population groups. 
A nasty trick no one's been able to pull off before. 
Maybe some kind of anti-Asian hate group. 
Maybe. Maybe what's happening 
is some kind of field test. 
 Why do you say that? 
 No one's claimed responsibility. 
And look at the way it's playing out  starting with a single victim, then a handful in a narrowly targeted area. 
I'm not sure what's worse. 
Somebody's out to kill me and mine or that they're using us as guinea pigs. 
 Got anything else for me? 
 I'm working on some leads but it's slow. 
Internet's been crashing all day. 
 Do what you can. 
 Talk to you later. 
Hello. 
Hey. I just wanted to call. 
 I never got to thank you for springing Asha. 
 No big deal. 
And because you were right. 
I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. 
Whatever it was that killed those people had nothing to do with transgenics. 
Guess our thing has just got me a little spun, you know? 
Yeah, me too. 
Is that me or you? 
Think it's me. Hold on. 
 Logan? I'm at Crash. Come over. 
 Max, come over. I'm at Crash. 
 I don't think so. 
 Not tonight. 
I have someone on the other line. 
 All right. 
 OK. See you. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 So. 
 Anyway, I just wanted to say... 
sorry about everything. 
Yeah, me too. 
 Good night. 
 Good night. 
 Hey, Max. 
 Hey. 
What delays? 
I told you three steps were gonna be involved. Did I not? 
Step one, target the pathogen to a single individual. 
Expose him to it via airborne dispersal, make sure he's the only one it affects. 
Went off without a hitch, did it not? 
Excuse me. 
Could you not put that there, please? 
It is a very expensive piece of equipment. 
Thank you. 
Step two. 
Target the pathogen to a specific race of people. 
The Chinese at the bus stop. 
I used gene expression on the base pair for the epicanthic fold. You know, the eyelid? 
Worked perfectly. No one died but them, yes? 
Your technology is very impressive. 
But let's move on to step three. 
I'm ready. You see, 
it was easy with the Chinese. 
I had specific gene sequences that I could target. 
But the kids you're targeting... 
Wow, that was tough. 
Because they're just a little bit of everything. 
 In the end... 
 Cyril. 
...I targeted 
their immunological surveillance cells. 
Cyril! Action is character. 
Show me some. 
 I showed you, didn't I? 
 Yes. 
 I showed you, didn't I? 
 Yes. 
I paid you half upfront. 
I gave you everything that you asked for. 
Now it's time for you to show me. 
This is your test subject. 
No problem. 
We can do it right now if you'd like. 
No, I wanna do it in the field. 
I wanna know for sure. 
Well, you're the boss. 
How does tomorrow sound? 
Assuming it all goes according to plan, how soon can you ramp up pathogen production? 
Well, I can manufacture enough to blanket the entire western seaboard by Friday. 
How you disperse it is, of course, up to you. 
These are good for small areas, but they're expensive and very hard to get ahold of. 
 We'll use helicopters. 
 Well, that sounds like a plan. 
By the weekend, there won't be a transgenic left alive from here to San Diego. 
Good. Maybe I'll play 
a round of golf on Sunday. 
Matt, I think I may have a lead. It said 
in the police reports that, both times, when the boy died and at the bus station, people thought they heard fireworks. 
 Yeah? So it's Chinatown. 
 No, listen. 
There's a type of bio-agent dispersion cartridge. 
It's fired from a hand-held launcher, triggered by an altimeter. 
According to my source, a buyer just shelled out for three of them, 20 grand apiece. 
Took delivery last week. 
 Tell me you got an address. 
 Have I ever let you down? 
 Three steps are gonna be involved here. 
 Why am I not surprised? 
Step one. We take the test subject 
into the target area. We release him. 
Step two. 
We use this to disperse the pathogen. 
There's enough to kill any transgenic in a two-mile radius. 
That's ample to cover Sector Four. 
 What if he escapes the kill zone? 
 No, that would be impossible. 
It takes a minute for the plume to hit ground level and four minutes to dissipate. 
There's no way on earth he could make it out alive. 
Step three. 
We track him and we retrieve the body. 
I have a correction to step three. 
You track him and retrieve the body. 
I'm staying away from here until this is done. 
What if you messed up and got a couple of base pairs wrong? 
We could end up with a sector full of dead people. 
 You don't trust me? 
 Make a believer out of me, Cyril. 
You'll get the rest of your money. 
You have a nice day, now. 
Matt. 
What is it? 
Max, it's me. We got a problem. 
You're free to go. 
You can run but you can't hide. 
What the hell are the cops doin' here? 
Son of a bitch. 
Drive. 
Units three and four, move into position. 
Units three and four, move into position. 
They're gonna test the pathogen on an X5. 
He busted out of a van on Mercer, took off down 11. 
 I gotta get him out. 
 In a minute, it'll hit ground level. 
The sector will be toxic for four minutes after that. 
 I'm going in. 
 Max! 
Jam Pony messenger comin' through. 
 Max! Max! 
 Hold up. Passes only. 
No, wait! 
Lady. 
I have no idea who you are, but you just cost me five million dollars. 
Thanks for letting him stay the night. 
He's had a rough couple of days. 
Logan's gonna help me get him over the border tomorrow. 
Killing us all, that was the plan. 
It still is. We just got lucky this time. 
See you first thing in the morning. 
You lay low, little fella. 
You too, big fella. 
Convinced Sung to let me hang on to everything we found in the guy's lab. 
Didn't want whoever hired him to get their hands on it again. 
 He's a good guy, Sung. 
 Yeah, he is. 
He's got a lot of questions. 
Not sure what I'm gonna tell him. 
As little as possible is usually a good idea. 
I'll do my best. 
Did I mention I was sorry for jumping to conclusions? 
Yeah. 
 Anything turn up on Sandeman's cane? 
 Nothing but traces of Rodentia calcium. 
The rats tried to eat it. 
 Another dead end. 
 Yeah. 
Listen, about the other night at Crash. 
Didn't know you were gonna be there. 
Same with me. 
I just needed to get out. 
I know the feeling. 
So. 
Anyway. 
Rafer. 
Asha. 
 Why are they asking Dad questions? 
 You started a witch hunt in our family. 
 What did you accuse my father of? 
 I didn't. 
You're pointing at him to cover yourself! 
He says Bob Warner had dealings with Syed Ali. 
Bring them in. 
We'll separate them and turn up the heat. 
I need help. I have to get into 
my father's private records. 
Who is the man in Visalia?! 
The man in Visalia is Mamud Faheen. 
He also thinks I'm in prison. 
 You make him believe you got out. 
 I need to see Mamud. 
 Should we go? 
 Not until I have confirmation it's Faheen. 
That's it. Everybody go! 
 We have to talk about Ron Wieland. 
 Does anyone know he's sequestered? 
No, but soon they'll figure out the last person they saw him with was you. 
I've invoked executive privilege and granted Sherry provisional security clearance. 
Seems every time I turn around, somebody advises me to send you away. 
Why don�t you? 
You may be able to get information nobody else can. 
 Damm it! Just play it cool. 
 Cool? We're in a stolen car. 
Step out of the car, please. 
And open the trunk. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Carla! 
 Oh, my God! He killed her! 
 Put your hands behind your head. 
 So whose car is it? 
 It's her father's. 
 Did he give it to you? 
 Not exactly. 
 Then what, exactly? 
 We took it without permission. 
 You stole this car? 
 I can't believe he killed her. 
Gary Matheson, the man Kim works for, beat his wife and was starting to hurt his daughter. 
Kim called me to help get Megan away from him. 
If that's true, why didn�t you go to the police? 
Why do I find you 20 miles outside of LA? 
I thought so. 
You have the right to remain silent. 
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. 
You have the right to an attorney. If you can't 
afford one, one will be appointed for you. 
Do you understand these rights? 
Is it safe in here? 
Stay away from cordoned areas, you'll be all right. 
 This building was bombed this morning. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 You got the rooms ready? 
Yeah. They're a little messed up, 
but good enough for interrogation. 
 How we doing here? 
 Final tally... 30 dead, 17 wounded. 
Davidorff and Lindauer are critical. 
What about Paula? 
Could you do me a favour and take them back to the rooms? 
Follow me, please. 
Listen, can I talk to you alone? 
Stay with them. I'll be there in a minute. 
 Find anything new? 
 No, just what I told you on the phone. 
The two men are contradicting each other. 
There's definitely a tie to Syed Ali. 
Looks like Ali is at the centre of this. 
I hope it brings us closer to finding the nuke. 
 Just tell me how hard I can push him. 
 Hard as you have to. 
Stick bamboo shoots under their fingernails. 
Get what they got. Time's running out. 
Call Henderson at FBI. Set up a conference 
call with him and the Attorney General. 
 Lynne. You have a sec? 
 Sure, Roger. 
I understand that Sherry Palmer has been given provisional security clearance. 
Yes, that's right. The president 
has invoked executive privilege. 
You OK with that? 
 It's different. 
 Yes, it is. 
I've weighed in about it. 
If I feel that she's becoming a problem, I'll let the president know. 
She's his ex-wife. 
That's a problem all by itself. 
No. Sandra, thank you. I'll get back with you. 
 Tell me about Ron Wieland. 
 What about him? 
I just got off the phone with Sandra Ivany at the network. 
She said no one's heard from him since he met with you this morning. 
David? You didn't detain him, did you? 
You are here today to help me, not question my judgment. 
And I am trying to help. 
What's going on with Wieland? 
 He was gonna go public with a rumour. 
 About the bomb? 
I cannot afford a panic. 
You can't keep him locked up indefinitely. 
People are already asking questions. 
We're holding him at the OC. 
When the crisis passes, I'll let him go. 
Well, meanwhile you've got a problem. 
His disappearance could raise questions you don't want to answer. 
 I put Armus on it. 
 Apparently it hasn't helped. 
 The word is getting out. 
 What do you suggest? 
Give him an on-air exclusive when this is over. 
I offered that to him. He didn't want it. 
Then let me talk to him. 
David, one talent you know I have is dealing with the media. 
And I know Ron. He likes me. 
No. You're here to gather information. 
And to help. You said so yourself. 
And today you can't afford to ignore that. 
Let me try talking to Ron. 
What would you say to him? 
I'll make it worth his while not to say anything. 
 Kim, I'm scared! 
 It's OK, Megan. 
You're gonna be OK. It's gonna be fine. 
Where are you taking her? 
She can't go back to LA. 
 Why not? 
 It's not safe. 
 Why didn�t you tell him? 
 My dad said not to tell anyone. 
He didn't know you'd be charged with murder. 
 I'm gonna tell him. 
 No. You can't. 
I'm telling you, Miguel, my dad said no one can know about this. 
I think you should tell him who your dad is. 
Let them call him. Let your dad explain 
why we're trying to get out of town. 
Come on, let's go. Come on. 
My father works at CTU, the place that got bombed this morning. 
His name is Jack Bauer. Please call him. He'll 
explain why it's not safe to be in LA today. 
You can call your father after you've been processed. 
Nina: "Who are you working with in LA?" 
Faheen: "I'm not going to give you any information." 
Faheen: "It's too late. Don't waste your time. 
The operation will be done." 
 This is not working. 
 It will work. 
 I just need a little more time. 
 No, you're done. 
 Jack, don't do this! 
 On your feet. 
 We're going back. 
 Did he talk? 
 No, he wouldn't talk to her. 
 What do we do? 
Have Division set up a white room. 
We'll handle it in LA. 
Wrong move. The deeper you bring him in, 
the more he'll shut down. 
 We'll see. 
 Rick, give me more time with him! 
You've had enough. 
Make sure Faheen gets to the airport. 
 And you? 
 I'll be right behind you. 
 You see what he's doing? 
 Jack, you can't take her. 
I have a document signed by the president! He can't do this! 
 My orders are to stay with you and her. 
 Forget that. All they need is Faheen. 
Don't push this. 
I can't leave you alone with her. 
 It's got nothing to do with you. Back off. 
 Step away from the car, Bauer. 
 Paul Koplin. Nice to meet you. 
 Thanks for coming. Come in. 
No problem. I spoke to Ralph, he told me 
what files we're going to have to get into. 
 The ones that linked Reza to this terrorist? 
 Yes. That's Syed Ali. 
The company computer is networked into this house. 
I'll have to hack some passwords. 
I assume you're authorising me to do that. 
 Yeah. Yeah, of course. 
 Is this it? 
I don't know why they dragged my family in for questioning on my sister's wedding day. 
I'm a little surprised about that, too, but it's a whole new world out there now. 
I'm sorry that happened, but as private investigators we're required by law to report any terrorist-related information to Homeland Security right off. 
Here it is. I accessed the monthly statements 
but I couldn't get into any detailed records. 
All right. Let's see what we can do. 
Armus? Where are you going? 
I'm taking Mrs Palmer to one of the conference rooms. 
 Does she have clearance? 
 Excuse me. 
But you don't need to speak about me as if I weren't here, Mr Stanton. 
I'm sorry, Mrs Palmer. Roger Stanton. 
I know who you are, Roger. 
It's just a highly restricted area. 
Yes, I know. However, 
I have been granted access. 
 Why do you need to be here? 
 That you�ll have to ask the president. 
 Armus. 
 Excuse me. 
My apologies, Mrs Palmer. It's just we're very 
careful about the flow of information today. 
There's no need to apologise. 
I would assume that you�re careful about the flow of information every day. 
Thank you. 
 Sherry Palmer. 
 Hello, Ron. 
Just when I thought this day couldn't get any stranger. 
I can imagine you're not happy about all of this. 
 I'd like to know what "this" is. 
 I don't exactly know myself. 
I don't believe you, Sherry. 
But unless they kill me I'm gonna have the story of the year. 
I was kidnapped by the leader of the free world. 
That's not necessarily true, Ron. 
There actually has been precedent for this kind of executive action. 
If you're here to shut me up, you're wasting your time. 
I sensed I was onto something. 
That they locked me in here only confirms it. 
I'm coming out of here with a story. Deal with it. 
Hm. 
 Mind if I sit down? 
 Of course not. 
We'd like to release you, Ron. 
And we will. 
But we need assurances you won't go public with the rumour you threatened to broadcast. 
In return for what? I get an exclusive with 
the president on some watered-down story? 
Not a watered-down story. Something else. 
You go out there, let everyone know that you are not missing. 
Don't say anything about this morning. 
The president will let you inside of the OC to report first-hand. 
No journalist has ever been inside there. 
Why did he send you down here to make this offer? 
In fact, what are you even doing back inside David Palmer's circle? 
Take the deal, Ron. 
In a couple of hours they'll brief you and then you'll know more than I do. 
Hey! Guys, you need some help? 
Yeah. 
Nina: "The only way out of this is to cooperate with them." 
Nina: "Mamud, it does your case no good if you end up dead." 
"Think about it, Mamud. 
We're on our way to Los Angeles." 
Faheen: "I'm not afraid to die." 
Nina: "How big is the bomb?" 
"What time is it supposed to go off?" 
Faheen: "You betrayed me. 
You betrayed us all. Traitor." 
Bring her back here now. 
Come on. 
We are out of time. If you want to 
live through this, be straight with me. 
 When was this planned? 
 Six months before I was arrested. 
 And Faheen approached you? 
 Yes, but through an intermediary. 
 He didn't tell you about the nuke? 
 No. 
I didn't know what the endgame was. 
I just knew it was something big. 
 Is there another way around Faheen? 
 No. 
Is he really willing to die? 
Yes. 
Jack, what are we gonna do? 
Take her back. 
Don't drive too long on that spare. 
There's not a lot of tread left. 
 Yes. Thank you very much, sir. 
 Why not follow me to Ventura Boulevard? 
 There's a tire store there. 
 No, no, no. We'll be fine. 
All right. You're all set. 
 Here. Please. 
 Don't worry about it. 
You know anybody who needs pool service, give 'em my card. OK? 
Of course, of course. 
 Thank you. Thank you, sir. 
 See ya! 
The kid said it was dangerous and to stay out of Los Angeles. 
This one told me a similar story. 
No details, though. 
 Do you think it's true? 
 I don't think so. 
 What, then? 
 They're telling stories. 
 Want me to call it in? 
 Wait until we get back, OK? 
 I'll see you there. 
 Yeah. 
 Your friend's got quite an imagination. 
 What did he say? 
That you were leaving town because some bomb's supposed to go off in LA today. 
That what you meant when you said it wasn't safe? 
Please, just call CTU and try and reach my dad. 
You need to get Megan, the girl that was with us. Keep her out of the city. 
LA Dispatch, this is 621. Put me through 
to Frank Reed over at FBI Local. 
I've been unable to reach anyone at the FBI for 45 minutes. 
 Unable to reach them? Why? 
 Lot of traffic on their lines for some reason. 
Keep trying. 
Give me a call when you get through. 
Copy that. 
What the hell is going on? 
 How did it go with Wieland? 
 He's not gonna play ball. 
He thinks he's got the upper hand. 
He knows we have to let him go eventually. 
Whether there's a legal precedent for this or not, he has a hell of a story. 
I'm so sorry, David. 
I thought I could charm him. 
OK, Sherry. That'll be all. 
David? 
Why are you treating me like this? 
It's not about you. I just have more 
important things to deal with right now. 
You know, you've always been able to forgive. 
Always given everyone a second chance, but not me. 
I came here today to tell you that you were right. 
Right to kick me off the campaign, right to file for divorce. 
Where's all this coming from? 
A place of honesty, of realisation. 
I was too caught up in the power. 
 And you're not now? 
 Of course. You know I love it. 
But now I am aware of what I can and can't handle. 
So what are you asking for? 
Let me help you. 
If what I bring to you can be useful, then you can consider it the start of a new confidence. 
All right. But I promise you 
absolutely nothing in return. 
OK. 
All right, there are the transaction records. 
On the week of the 23rd, Reza made four withdrawals from the company's discretionary account. 
$175,000, $150,000, $50,000, another $50,000... 
 That's almost a half a million dollars. 
 Yeah. 
 What did he do with the money? 
 Let's see. 
He wrote a check to Syed Ali for $475,000 in return for "consulting services." 
So what? Maybe they were doing business. 
Syed Ali's only business is bankrolling terrorists. 
What about my father? 
What's his connection to all this? 
Reza convinced CTU your father authorised these transactions, or maybe he just did them on his own. 
I'm speculating. 
My father is not involved in terrorism. 
The government made a mistake. 
We have to find it and clear him. 
All right. Let's try 
and get into his personal calendar. 
Let's see what he did the days the checks were written. 
Fine. 
OK. 
Here's your father's schedule for that week. 
 Nothing here, either. 
 Of course not. 
My father has nothing to do with any of this. 
I shouldn't have called you. 
This is a waste of time. 
 Wait a minute. 
 What? 
There's a file in his personal directory that's accessed almost daily. 
It has a resource tab on it, which means it's a government file. 
 My dad has government clients. 
 Whoa! 
 What? 
 It's an autodelete program. 
 Can�t you do something? 
 Yeah, I'm trying. 
 This can't be right. 
 What? 
The data on this volume has a comsat grid. 
You see, these are addresses. CSG14877. 
 That's an encoded coordinate. 
 I don't know what you�re getting at. 
The only people who have files like these have government security clearance. 
 Why would my dad have that? 
 I don't know. 
 Why have I been kept waiting here like this? 
 Sit down, please, Mr Warner. 
 I have some information. 
 Sit down! 
What information do you have? 
I'm not supposed to talk to anybody about this, but under the circumstances... 
I am a consultant for the CIA. 
There's the contact code for my liaison. 
Call Langley, they'll verify. 
 Why didn�t you tell me this at the house? 
 Come on. You know the drill. 
I'm not supposed to talk to anyone about this without clearance. 
What's your l-3 protocol? 
I was approached about five years ago because of my international investment work. 
They asked me if I'd like to help my country and I said OK. 
What do you do? 
My corporation is used as a conduit to pass information back and forth. 
 To whom? 
 I don't know. 
That is the truth. 
Now you listen to me, Mr Almeida. 
I am not an enemy of this country. 
I am a patriot. I love my country. 
I don't know any Syed Ali, nor why there is a record of me doing business with him. 
Well, if that's true then you have nothing to worry about, do you? 
But there is a connection between your company and Syed Ali. 
And I'm gonna find out what it is. 
So in the meantime, sit tight. 
I'm gonna check this out. 
 Kimberly Bauer? 
 Yes. We need to talk to Jack Bauer. 
 He's not here. What's this about? 
 His daughter is in custody. 
It's important we speak to him immediately. 
Hold on. OK. 
Laurie, I need you to call downstairs... 
George, Bob Warner just told me he does deliveries for the CIA. 
CIA? Did you check it out? 
No. I was about to call his liaison, but it 
looks like he's got a legitimate contact code. 
If that is the case, then Reza's lying to us. 
I don't know. I pushed Reza pretty hard. 
 I think he's telling the truth. 
 We have to push harder than usual today. 
So dig in and see what you can find out. 
Let me know. 
Mr Mason? It's the sheriff in Newhall. 
They're holding Kim Bauer. 
 Why? 
 She's been charged with murder. 
Call Jack. This is George Mason. 
Who am I speaking to? 
Bauer. 
 It's Michelle. 
 What? 
I don't know how to say this. 
We're on the line with the sheriff in Newhall. 
 They're holding Kim. 
 For what? 
 She's being held on some criminal charges. 
 What are you talking about? 
She's on the line. 
Should I patch her through? 
 Yes. Get Mason on this. 
 I'm on with the precinct. We're working on it. 
There's a mistake. I need you to 
straighten it out and get Kim out of LA. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 Daddy? 
 Kim, what happened? 
 I was leaving the city, like you said. 
I was with Megan and my boyfriend, Miguel. 
And the CHP pulled us over for speeding. 
They found a body in the trunk. Carla's body. 
 Carla? The woman you work for? 
 Yeah. 
We took her husband's car. He must've done 
it this morning and put the body in the trunk. 
 Oh, my God, help me. 
 Just relax, we're gonna straighten this out. 
He beat her up. That's why I needed 
to take Megan. He was hurting her, too. 
CTU will send someone. 
They'll get you out of there now. 
I don't want them to send someone else. 
I want you to help me. Can�t you do that? 
They think I killed Carla, Dad. 
Dad, I need you here now. 
Hold on a second. Michelle, are you there? 
 Yeah. 
 What is Faheen saying now? 
Nina told him that US forces have been sent to his village, that they're rounding up his family. 
Faheen called her a liar. 
 Dad? 
 Kim, hold on. 
She just told Faheen that she has the power to save them. 
 Dad? 
 Kim, hold on. What are they saying now? 
 We can't pick it up. The audio's too low. 
 Are you there? 
Yeah. George, I need you to help Kim. If you 
have to supersede local authority, do it. 
 Get her out of LA. 
 Done. 
Nina, what did he tell you? 
Everything. 
 No! She just slit his throat! 
 Hello? 
I got her! Get him on the floor! 
Get him on the floor! 
Can't stop this. 
Dad! 
 You got him? 
 We're losing him. 
Son of a bitch! 
 Jack... 
 Secure her! 
I know where the bomb is. 
Take the plane to San Diego. 
I want civilian transport to Sao Paolo. 
I'll tell you everything when we're down. 
 George, are you getting this? 
 Yeah, I am. 
 He's gone! 
 This is your call. 
We're out of time. 
I don't like being dicked around. 
We can bring her into CTU and press her there. 
 No. It'll take too long. Take her to San Diego. 
 Fine. 
 Tell the pilot to go to San Diego. 
 You got it. 
This is how it works. We land, 
you tell me where the bomb is. 
We're gonna hold you until we get a result, you got that? 
Got it. 
Sir? I may have found something 
in the Faheen recordings. 
 What'd it say? 
 A name. 
Marko Khatami. Listen. 
...Marko Khatami. 
 Did you try crossreferencing? 
 Yeah, he's connected to Syed Ali. 
 Mr Naiyeer? 
 What? 
 Who's Marko Khatami?! 
 I have no idea! 
Who is he?! 
Get off! 
 Somebody help me. 
 You're crazy! 
 You're mad! 
 Just cool it! Cool down! 
Let me go. 
 Are we being released? 
 No. You're being transferred. 
 To where? 
 I don't know. 
Someone from CTU called. Said they were 
coming to pick you up and take over the case. 
What about Megan? 
You brought her back here, right? 
 What's gonna happen to her? 
 It's none of your business. 
You can't take her back to LA! 
You listen to me. 
I checked you out. Your father works for CTU. 
You tell me, what did he tell you would happen today in LA? 
I can't say anything, but you can't take Megan back. 
Just tell me what's going on. 
It's a nuclear bomb. 
They didn't say anything because they don't want to start a panic. 
OK. 
 Did you get anything else off the recording? 
 It's 99%noise. 
 You OK? 
 Just running on empty. 
 Then why don�t you get something to eat? 
 No, I'm fine. 
Your neck's bleeding here. 
It's somebody else's blood. 
Michelle, why don�t you take a few minutes, get cleaned up and changed. You'll feel better. 
Hey. 
We're gonna survive this day. 
All right? 
Come on, get changed. Come on. 
Mr President? 
These are the updated guidelines Stanton sent to local law enforcement and the FBI. 
 I understand Sherry ran into Stanton. 
 I didn't hear that. 
Has he said anything to you about her being here? 
 I don't think he's very happy about it. 
 Do you have a problem with her? 
 I know you think she's useful to you. 
 That's not what I asked. 
I welcome help wherever we can get it. 
If you feel she performs a function here... 
 Sir, you better come out here. 
 What is it, Mike? 
I've confirmed that there is an imminent threat to national security and public safety. 
While I cannot confirm the target or nature of the attack, it may come from Middle Eastern terrorists, but terrorists in the US may also be involved. 
How did he get out? 
What I find troubling about this story is our president knows about this threat and isn't saying anything to the public. 
 Who was controlling that room? 
 Armus. 
I want to see him now. 
It doesn't make sense. If my father 
really does work for the government, which is impossible to believe, wouldn't he know if Reza did something illegal? 
I'd think so, especially if terrorism was involved. 
If he knew about Reza, what does that mean? 
My guess is your father was aware that Reza was involved in some kind of illegal activity. 
 He was monitoring him for some reason. 
 But that doesn't make sense either. 
My father would not let someone he was investigating marry Marie. 
He got upset if anyone made any critical remark about Reza. 
 He treated him like a son. 
 I know Agent Almeida at CTU pretty well. 
I'll give him a call and see if we could find out... 
Go! Go! 
The Sunday before you killed my wife, Teri and I went down to the boardwalk in Venice. 
Just watching all the rollerbladers and musicians, laughing at the crazy people... 
Just spending time together. 
And Teri sees this snow-cone stand. 
She giggles like a kid, she takes off running and she wants to get in line, she wants one. 
I remember I was watching her... 
I couldn't help myself. 
She was talking with an old lady in line behind her. The two of them were laughing. 
I remember thinking to myself "How the hell does she do that?" 
"How does she strike up a conversation with an absolute stranger?" 
And they just started laughing like they'd been friends forever. 
That's a gift. 
I remember thinking "God, I wish I could do that." But I can't. 
That was Teri. 
My wife. 
That's what you took from this world. 
That's what you took from me and my daughter. 
I just wanted you to know that. 
We got a man down! 
Vice president's on the line. 
Jim, I have reason to believe the Cyprus audio was fabricated. 
I thought we proved it was real. 
CTU LA is in the process of obtaining intelligence that may show otherwise. 
With all due respect, it's too late for second thoughts. 
 Come out with your hands on your head. 
 I killed a man! 
If you turn yourself in, they'll consider that. 
If I see you coming in, I will kill her! 
Go, go, go! 
 He wasn't working alone. 
 What? 
Baker was keeping an eye on Kate. 
Michelle distracted him. 
 Did you help Jack take Kate Warner? 
 Of course not. 
Put a filter on all of Michelle's communications. 
Let me know when Jack tries to contact her. 
 What's going on? 
 Ten minutes ago a man called me. 
Said he had proof the evidence the president was basing his decisions on was forged. 
He'll give me more info if I bring you to him. 
I got what you need. I won't give it to you 
until you give me Kate. 
How does the evidence prove the recording was forged? 
I have the source recordings. 
Why did you follow me from CTU? 
When you broke out, you isolated yourself. 
You'll need help. 
They're coming at us from both sides of the alley! 
The roof! 
Fire escape! 
Give me the keys! 
 Here! 
 Yusuf, give me cover! 
Kate, get out of the trunk and stay down! 
 Left! On the left! 
 Go for the door now! 
Kate, come with me. 
Get down. Stay down! 
 Who are these guys?! 
 Followup team sent by my employers. 
 Figured out they didn't get me. 
 How'd they know you were here? 
Beats the hell out of me. 
 Jack, you there? 
 Yusuf, are you OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Where are you? 
I've managed to get to the vehicle and rearm. 
 What's out there? 
 Three down that I know of. 
There's three more. I don't have their 
positions. I'll find a better vantage point. 
We'll figure out what we're gonna do in here. I'll get back to you. Stand by. 
 Have him cover us. Let's get out of here! 
 We don't know how many are out there! 
 I'll call my person at CTU. She can help. 
 Negative. You're not calling anybody. 
The only way you get the proof Palmer needs is if we do this my way. We go now! 
They're trying to kill us. 
Doesn't it prove something? 
Not to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in DC. 
 Call Yusuf, let's shape an exit strategy! 
 Jack. 
 Yusuf, go ahead. 
 Sounds like another Humvee just arrived. 
Son of a bitch. Stand by. 
We're surrounded. 
You've gotta let me make this call. 
I've got someone on the inside that can give us infrared satellite. 
I guarantee you, I will not jeopardise your identity. 
 Off line? 
 Yes. 
Do it. 
 Dessler. 
 It's Jack. Are we secure? 
My cell's scrambled, but don't call on agency numbers. I'm being monitored. 
You were right, Ali's recording was fake. 
The president's about to invade the Middle East based on falsified evidence. 
 Do you have proof? 
 Not yet, but I can get it. I need your help. 
It'll be difficult. Tony's been breathing 
down my neck since I helped you. 
 Work around it. I need infrared satellite. 
 Where are you? 
 Get the coordinates off our connection. 
 What are you looking for? 
We're surrounded. 
There's three of us inside. 
I need to know how many men are outside. 
I got a friendly at the end of the alley, behind the dumpster. 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 Thanks. 
 Yusuf? 
 I'm here. 
We're gonna be a few minutes. 
We're waiting on satellite. 
It's gonna take a while. 
We should secure our position. 
Come on. 
 Is Mr Garcia gonna be all right? 
 He'll live. 
I'm gonna put down that you claim the shooting was an accident. 
It was. 
He'll still have to explain to the DA what he was doing going into the store with a gun. 
 It wasn't his. 
 What's that? 
The gun, it was mine. 
What are you doing with a gun? 
Someone gave it to me earlier tonight. 
Look, my name's Kim Bauer. 
This afternoon, I escaped from police custody. 
And I'm a suspect in a murder. 
While most Americans are asleep and haven't heard the news about the nuclear detonation in California, many are up and are starting to react. 
That reaction is taking many forms, and in some cases violence is erupting. 
We're still awaiting a statement from the White House on who is behind the attack. 
 That's enough. 
 We hope... 
 The alert status of the National Guard? 
 They're ready in metropolitan areas. 
 What about outside the big cities? 
 We may have to get help from the military. 
Local law enforcement might not be able to do the job. 
Call General Bowden, tell him to put troops on standby. 
The army? We can't do that. 
 You're worried about posse comitatus. 
 Exactly. 
We can't use army or air force on American soil. Only navy and marines. 
No, the navy can't help us. And there are 
not enough marines on standby. 
 I'll deal with the consequences. Call him. 
 Yes, sir. 
 The status of our bombers? 
 They're proceeding to their targets. 
 Where are they now? 
 South of Greenland. 
They should enter Middle Eastern airspace in four hours. 
Thank you. 
What are you doing on the satellite? 
Just checking on something. 
Prepped the files for the next shift? 
Yeah, I'm almost done. 
I'm gonna go see if Tony needs some help. 
 Hey... what's up? 
 You asked me to keep an eye on Michelle? 
 Yeah. 
 She was accessing a modsat screen. 
That's not unusual. 
We've been on mod-sat all night. 
She received a call that wouldn't lock onto our log. 
 It was open? 
 Yeah. 
 It might have been Division. 
 It might have been. 
All right... find out what she 
was looking at. Let me know. 
Yusuf, what's happening out there? 
I think they�re repositioning. 
We're still waiting on satellite. 
I'll get back to you. 
With CTU's help, we're gonna get out of here, I promise. 
What does Wallace want with me? 
 He needs you to get out of the country. 
 Needs me? How? 
With your father's CIA connections, his company has a special travel dispensation. 
They wouldn't let him on board as a passenger unless... 
I was on the plane with him. 
I know. 
Kate. 
I will not let you get on that plane. 
Is there any way I can find out how my boyfriend is doing? 
I don't know about that. 
Wait till we get to the station. 
There was also another officer. 
His name was Brown. 
 He was in the accident as well. 
 I don't know him either. 
Look, miss, you're under arrest. 
So, take my advice, don't say any more. 
It doesn't matter anyway. 
You can make a phone call at the station. 
Who am I gonna call? 
My dad was the one who was flying the plane, the one with the bomb in it. 
I don't have anyone any more. 
 Almeida. 
 She's looking at infrareds. 
She's been collecting data. 
Pull coordinates off what she's looking at. 
If it's for Jack, that's where we'll find him. 
 I tried that. 
 What's the problem? 
She's covered her tracks. 
She's pulled 100 quadrants. 
I have no idea which one she's interested in. 
I'll tell you what, I'll deal with this, Carrie. 
All right? Thanks. 
 Yeah? 
 I don't have a lot of time. Are you ready? 
Give me one sec. 
 OK, I'm ready. 
 I count11, including your friendly. 
I'm sending you their positions on an infrared map. 
They're all stationary except for one. 
Jack, he's roving. 
 OK, send it. 
 OK. 
 You got it? 
 Yeah, I got it. 
How much longer do you need to stay anonymous? 
 I don't know, why? 
 Tony's watching me. Gotta go. 
 How are you holding up? 
 All right. 
 I've got so much to do. 
 I know. 
You always take a phone with you to the bathroom? 
 Where's Jack? 
 I don't know. 
We've been monitoring all communication coming in and out all day. 
 If you're breaking protocol... 
 I'm not. 
All right, then I'll ask you again. 
 Where's Jack? 
 I don't know. 
But you have to call President Palmer. 
Tell him not to act on the recording until Jack finishes the investigation. 
 So you have talked to Jack? 
 I didn't say that. 
Listen carefully, Michelle. 
 You don't work for Jack, you work for me. 
 Get past your ego... 
Ego? You don't like the way 
I'm doing my job, that's your problem. 
But if you know anything about Jack Bauer, you'd better tell me about it right now! 
I have no information. I'm not helping Jack. 
I hope you're not lying to me. 
She counted nine, plus one roving. 
If I was a sniper, I'd cover the building from here. 
 Yeah, looks right. 
 We'll have to build a corridor. 
 Which exit? 
 This one right here. 
Go between here, let 'em fire at each other. 
It'll give us ten seconds to get to the car. 
With just us firing? 
We don't have another way. 
Jack, I know how to shoot a gun. 
Take this. You stay right behind me. 
 Yusuf, this is Jack, do you copy? 
 Yeah. 
We're getting ready to make our exit. 
 Let me give you positions. 
 Go ahead. 
We've counted nine, plus one roving. 
We got two shooters on the balcony right above me. Three in the building adjacent. 
I just got off with the secretary of defence. 
He wants to know how much longer you'll give Jack Bauer to disprove that tape before we fail-safe the orders. 
Jack Bauer will have up until the time the planes start releasing bombs. 
From the secretary's point of view, that's tying the DOD's hands. 
The longer it takes for your decision, the less flexibility he has, and he may want to launch a prestrike... 
There will be no prestrikes on this mission. 
We're gonna utilise every moment we have to be thorough. 
 He won't like that. 
 That's his problem. 
I understand. 
Sir, there's a situation that requires your immediate attention. 
What, Mike? 
Civil unrest is starting to tip up and down the East Coast. 
The area I'm most concerned about is outside of Atlanta. 
What's going on there? 
Some ad hoc militias have joined forces and they're getting very aggressive in one of the suburbs. 
 Is this racially motivated? 
 Yes. 
The demographics of the area are predominantly Middle Eastern. 
What do you hope to accomplish here? 
We want Washington to know we consider ourselves at war. 
We want these people interned. 
And if they won't do it, we will. 
Who do you want interned? Most people 
in this neighbourhood are US citizens. 
They weren't born here. 
Some of them don't speak English. 
They memorise answers to 50 questions, take the test, then we let them vote. 
How do you respond to claims that these people have no more to do with the bomb than you or I? 
If we'd locked down our borders 20 years ago, none of this would have happened. 
What's eerie is, even though the crowd has been here for half an hour, there are only a few police cars. 
Why? I thought we ordered 
the National Guard. 
Some are on their way, some are at other flash points. 
 Want me to call the FBI and the army? 
 And tell them what? 
 They've had their orders. 
 The problem is resources. 
We just don't have enough bodies to cover everything. 
Where's the media heading right now? 
It's happening all up and down the East Coast. 
But this city, Marietta in Atlanta, seems to have the most traction with the press. 
All right. This is what we're gonna do. 
We may be short on manpower, but it doesn't have to appear that way. 
Send all the Eastern Georgia National Guard to Marietta. 
And tell the media that this is where something's going to happen. 
What's going to happen, sir? 
If this is what the people are going to be watching, let's show them how we're going to respond. 
I want them to see how we protect our citizens. 
We will not put up with racism or xenophobia. 
If this is where it's gonna start, this is where it's gonna stop! 
All right, I'm all set up here. 
Start laying down the smoke. 
We're ready to go. 
Copy that. Go in on the smoke. 
You take the men on the left, I got the ones right above us. You ready? 
Smoke's in place. I'll draw fire 
and go pick up the vehicle. 
Go! 
 Kate! 
 Jack! 
Kate, get down! 
Kate. Come on, we gotta keep going. 
Keep moving! 
Get in the front seat and stay down! 
Get down! 
Stay down! Go, go, go! 
Let me look at it. 
No exit wound. 
We gotta get you to a hospital. 
 No. LAX, cargo departures. 
 You will not make it. 
I'll make it. Just stop the bleeding. 
Kate, in the glove box, there's a first-aid kit. 
Get me all the gauze, pads and wraps. 
Hold on, hold on. 
Put pressure on it now. 
It's a surreal scene in Marietta. 
It's 4.30am and normally people 
would be at home, asleep. 
Yet today a showdown is in the making. 
The riots have escalated all over the city. 
Fires and looting are reported to be widespread. 
The National Guard continue to roll in, as do the angry citizens, who are taking out their frustration on this peaceful Middle Eastern community. 
You got what you asked for. 
It's on all the news channels. 
Manski of the National Guard wants to know what tactical rule-set you wanna follow. 
 What are they on now? 
 Containment only. 
Unacceptable. I want the law enforced. 
Tell him to start making arrests and taking people in. 
Sir, if you declare a curfew you can start pulling every one of them in  before this thing gets out of control. 
 That a good idea, do it. 
 Tell him we're not afraid to take action. 
 Yes, sir. 
What will help more than anything, sir, is your voice. 
You need to talk directly to the people. 
I know. 
Tell Jenny I'll be down in a few minutes. 
 Murphy speaking. 
 This is Novick. I need Jenny Dodge. 
 Carrie. 
 Yeah? 
LAPD said there was automatic-weapon fire in Studio City. 
Police are finding bodies and military-spec weapons. 
We got the address. Check it against 
what Michelle pulled off the satellite. 
Right away. 
Is that the location, Michelle? Huh, is it? 
The police just got there, they already got four bodies. So let's talk! 
 Yeah, that's it. 
 We gotta call him. He may need our help. 
Jack made it clear that the only way to get proof is if CTU stays out of it. 
We don't even know if he's still alive! 
He's on an open channel. You won't be able 
to trace it, but you can talk to him. 
 Michelle! 
 No, Jack, it's Tony. 
Tony, trust me, stay out of this! 
 What's going on? 
 The president asked me for proof that the Cyprus recording was fake. 
I'm trying to do that. 
The man who can provide proof will only deal with me. He won't cooperate with CTU. 
 That's why I left in that way. 
 How do we know he's not using you? 
Cos ten commandos tried to kill him to stop him from making a deal with me. 
 What's he want? 
 He wants to disappear. 
We'll deal with him here. 
He will not cooperate with us under those circumstances. 
I understand, but this country's about to go to war over this. 
This is too big for one person to handle. Even you. 
Keep going straight! 
Sorry, I can't do it. 
He's still bleeding bad! 
Hey, Bobby. 
Is this Kim Bauer? 
 I'll take her. 
 What about processing her? 
It's OK. Go fill out the report. 
Come with me. 
We'll go in here. 
Have a seat. 
Looks like you've had quite a day. 
 Yeah. 
 You took Megan Matheson from her home. 
 She was being abused. 
 Got into a fight with her father. 
Then, you took Megan again, this time from the hospital. 
 You stole Gary's car and fled the city. 
 I had to. I knew about the bomb. 
Understood. But then you were stopped 
by CHP Officer Raymond Brown, who discovered the dead body of Carla. 
 I didn't kill anyone. 
 I know you didn't. 
We know Gary killed his wife. 
We're looking for him. 
There was a witness, and we found his prints on the murder weapon. 
 You did? 
 Yes. 
You're off the hook for everything that happened this morning. 
Thank God. 
There's still the matter of you and your boyfriend's attempted escape from custody. 
Officer Brown was badly injured in the accident. But he's gonna make it. 
And we now know that you were telling him the truth about the bomb. 
So I'm free? 
You should have somebody from CTU call the DA's office on your behalf. 
But yes, you'll be free to go. 
I know my father usually does this, but I have clearance. 
An officer of the company has to be on the flight. 
 I'll be on it. Can you hold on? 
 Certainly. 
 Where are you going? 
 Jakarta. 
Surprised I'm giving up my destination? 
No. You'll just change it 
once you're in the air. 
Prep a cargo transport to Jakarta, Indonesia. 
Give us clearance so we can leave tonight. 
Who else will be flying with you? 
What name should I give them? 
 Passport, in my pocket. 
 I got it. 
 William Patterson. 
 One moment, please. 
Come on, stay with me. 
He's losing consciousness! 
Wallace, we can't take this chance. 
Tell me where the evidence is, and I give you my word, I'll get you out of the country. 
You know what, Jack? You were a real 
badass back there at the warehouse. 
Son of a bitch. 
No. 
 I'm losing him! Damn it! 
 What are you doing? 
I wanna see if there's an urgent care centre in the neighbourhood. 
Come on! 
Four blocks. Four blocks, make a right. Go! 
I want ID's on the bodies. 
See what traces are on the weapons. 
 Bauer's actions are CTU's responsibility. 
 We won't run from this. 
 Let's find out who they are. 
 Send in forensic teams? 
 Yeah. 
 NSA and field units? 
Yeah, that's fine. 
Mr Almeida, Kim Bauer on line four. 
 Kim, where are you? 
 At a sheriffs station in Santa Clarita. 
 What happened? 
 I won't be charged for murder, but... 
 Look, I still might need some help. 
 Sure, what do you need? 
They were taking us back to LA, and my boyfriend and I tried to escape. 
And we got into a car accident. 
A police officer was injured. 
 I'll call the DA's office, see what I can do. 
 Thank you. 
I'm sure you'd rather be talking to your dad about this, but I know they probably told you he's not available right now. 
 What are you talking about? 
 He's in the field. 
In the field? You mean, he's alive? 
Oh, my God, Kim. 
You still think he died in the plane. 
 He didn't? 
 No, no. George Mason took over. 
He was able to get out in time. 
Oh, my God. When can I talk to him? 
Not for a while, Kim. 
Come on, come on, get him! 
 I need to see the doctor! 
 You can't do that. 
 Open the door! 
 I will call the police! 
 Lady, I am the police. Now, open the door! 
 Let him in. Let him in! 
 We need you! 
 What happened? 
He's been shot. I'm a Federal Agent. 
He has information vital to national security. 
I need you to stop the bleeding and keep him alive. 
This is a clinic. He needs a hospital. 
We don't have time. You've got to do 
what you can now. Doctor, please. 
All right. Clara, get me suture kits, lidocaine 
with epi, and a crash cart. Now, now! 
The wound's right here. 
He's got a bullet lodged in his back. 
 Hello. 
 Miguel, it's me. 
 Kim. Are you OK? 
 I'm fine. How are you? 
 I'm OK. 
 Yeah? 
Look, it's so weird, but the police know Gary killed Carla. 
We're not gonna be charged with anything, except maybe the escape. 
But I think we're OK there, too. 
 That's good. 
 Good? It's great. 
Yeah. 
 How about you? 
 I'm fine. 
Are you sure? I mean, you don't sound... 
I don't sound what? Excited? 
Gee, Kim, I'm really sorry. 
Miguel, what's wrong? 
Why are you acting like this? 
 I shouldn't have let you talk me into it. 
 Yeah, but it worked out. 
For you. I'm the one 
that's here in the hospital. 
 You just said you were fine. 
 I am going to be fine. 
 I'm just gonna be fine without you. 
 What? 
 I don't wanna see you any more. 
 Why not? 
 There's no "why not", it just is. 
 No. 
Miguel, what is going on? Are you OK? 
 I'm coming to see you right now. 
 Kim, I said no. It's over. 
You mean that? 
Yeah... I mean it. 
I know the rules. 
I know that I work for you. 
And if you fire me, I wouldn't blame you. 
This isn't about me firing you, Michelle. 
This agency is supposed to be supporting the president and this country. 
If I can't account for our actions, we've got chaos. 
Jack is in an impossible situation. I was 
helping him get proof the audio was fake. 
Yeah? Well, where's the proof? 
We don't have any proof. 
We don't have Jack, he doesn't want to be found. 
What do you want from me, Michelle? 
I just wanted to say I'm sorry. 
Yeah, well, you've said it. 
Now, if you don't mind, I got work to do, all right? 
Our planes are over the Atlantic. 
They will be reaching their targets in three hours. 
 The pilots' communication posture? 
 Comm is open to them. 
The planes can be ordered back at any time. 
Good. 
I don't know if anyone's told you, but the sooner we can lock this mission down, the more comfortable the Joint Chiefs will be with it. 
My job's not to make the Joint Chiefs comfortable. 
Thank you. That'll be all. 
Yes, sir. 
Mr President. There's been 
a development in Marietta. 
The National Guard took on a more aggressive posture at our request. 
But the disturbance got to be more than they could handle. 
What happened? 
Two people were killed, sir. 
The National Guard started shooting rubber bullets, and there were two fatal hits. 
One of the victims was a leader of the dissent, and... 
 And? 
 And the other was a young boy, sir. 
He was Middle Eastern, and he was from one of the families that we were trying to protect. 
What's going on now? 
They've made some arrests, but the crowd is still unruly. 
Now, we might want to think about taking a step back. 
Maybe the presence of the National Guard is making matters worse. 
If we step back now, those families are left completely unprotected. 
Yeah. 
A young boy. 
What was his name? 
The boy? 
 I don't know, sir. 
 The boy had a name. Find out. 
Indeed I will, sir. 
It was a tragic accident. 
Tell the National Guard to hold their ground. 
I want that neighbourhood protected. 
I want order restored. 
Yes, sir. 
There's the bullet. It missed the jugular, 
but still caused damage. 
 What can you do? 
 I might be able to tie off the bleeders. 
 You can't get the bullet out without surgery. 
 We don't have time for that. 
I don't feel comfortable with this. 
They can shut me down. 
I'm not authorised for this procedure. 
I guarantee that won't happen. 
I need you to do this now. 
 At least tell me what this is all about. 
 It has to do with the bomb that went off. 
I'm sorry, I can't tell you more than that. 
 All right, I'll see what I can do. 
 Thank you. 
 Give him some Versed. 
 No, don't sedate him. 
I need him to be able to talk. 
Just numb the area around the wound. 
Don't worry, beautiful. 
I've been worse than this. 
 He's gonna die. 
 We better hope he doesn't. 
OK, so we'll depart at 3.45? 
That'd be great. Thank you. 
 Is he on? 
 They gave us a departure time for 3.45. 
Good. 
He won't give you information till we're off the ground. 
I told you, I'm not letting you get on that plane. 
All he wants to do is get out of the country. 
Soon as we get him to the airport, he'll give us the information. The rules have changed. 
Hold still, almost there. 
Stop. It's done. 
It's not done. Now, sir, please lie still 
or I'll have to sedate you. 
 I said, I'm done! 
 Push the Versed now. 
 Wait! 
 Jack. 
 What? 
 Jack, I'm not gonna make it. I can feel it. 
Just tell me where the evidence is now. 
It's on a memory chip. 
Two AIF files. 
The source recordings prove the Cyprus audio is a fake. 
Where is the memory chip? 
It's in... inside... 
 Inside what? 
 Inside... 
Inside where? Come on, Wallace. 
Inside where? Doctor! 
 He's in Vfib! 
 Excuse us. We need to get in here. 
 No pulse. 
 We're at 200 joules. 
Here you go, Doctor. 
 Charging. 123, clear. 
 Clear. 
 Still in Vfib. Charging, 123, clear. 
 Clear. 
 Still in Vfib. Charging, 123, clear. 
 Clear. 
He's dead. 
Jack, what are we gonna do? 
I don't know. 
I don't know. 
What are you doing? 
What are you doing?! 
We got it. 
There's a link between Stanton and the mercenaries that shot down Bauer's plane. 
Stanton won't be easy to break. You may 
need to expand the limits of how far you'll go. 
Mr Stanton, by order of the president, I'm placing you under arrest. 
This falls outside the parameters of your charge. 
What would you like me to do, sir? 
I don't know what you�re talking about. 
 Where is she now? 
 She ran off after the accident. 
Maybe she was trying to avoid the local police or trying not to get brought back to LA. 
Just find her, George. 
Ow! 
Marie, we have a problem. 
Basheer and Marko are dead. 
 What do you need me to do? 
 They were gonna pick up the trigger. 
 Where is it? 
 The place Marko worked. In his locker. 
You must gain access to this locker and bring the trigger to Omar. 
I'll take care of it. 
I've earned the right to know what's going on. 
Syed Ali is at the centre of a terrorist attack. 
We need you to identify him for us. 
He's in there. Syed Ali. He's in there. 
Damm it! 
He's dead, Jack. 
These clothes don't belong to this man. 
Maintain secure exits. 
Ali is still in the building. 
Step outside until we get the situation resolved. 
 Agent Bauer told me to stay. Talk to him. 
 As soon as you step outside. 
She stays with us. She's gotta make 
the final identification on Ali. 
This was in the pocket of the man Ali set on fire. 
 It might be a document Ali was carrying. 
 Photo it, send it to CTU. 
Are you trying to protect this man? 
No, I have no misplaced loyalties. 
If the man has murdered an innocent, he is as guilty in the eyes of Islam as he is in yours. 
The man that I'm looking for set in motion a plan today to detonate a nuclear weapon in Los Angeles. 
 Are you certain? 
 Yes, we're certain. 
We estimate between one and two million people will die if this bomb goes off. 
That, sir, is why we need to find him now. 
Thank you for informing me, but I can be no more honest with you than I have been. 
But if you find this man, perhaps I can talk to him in a way you cannot. 
Persuade him. 
Agent Bauer? 
Thank you. 
We found something I think you should see. 
We found this trap door. It's not on 
any of the schematics you gave us. 
Open it. 
 I go down... I'm going down alone. 
 I know this is your operation... 
Listen to me. We just lost one of Ali's men 
to a cyanide capsule hidden in his tooth. 
We have to assume Ali's willing to take his life the same way. He can't see us coming. 
Have your men assemble at the base of the ladder. Await my instructions. 
Have you got your baton with you? 
Let me have it. OK. 
 Hello? 
 Marie. 
 There has been a change of plans. 
 Why? What's going on? 
Just go to the rendezvous point. 
If I'm not there within one half-hour of the time we have planned, then you know what to do. 
 You remember what I said, yes? 
 I remember. 
I've got the suspect! 
Engage the room! Engage the room! 
Get his legs! 
 That's him! That is Syed Ali! 
 Get her outta here! Get her outta here! 
Get her outta here! 
I got the cyanide. Get him ready. 
Baker! 
Find out who he was talking to. 
It's hard not to sit here and think that there must be some mistake, even with the evidence you have. 
It's black-and-white, Bob. Your daughter 
killed Reza and two of our agents. 
And I need you to help us understand what her connection to Syed Ali is. 
If I'd known she was involved, I would have done something. 
And now that you do know, does it help explain any strange behaviour? 
Anything you can tell us will help. 
Well... 
Marie went to college in London while I was working there. 
That's when her mother died, and it hit her hard, hit us all hard. 
And? 
She ran away for a while. 
How long? 
Three, maybe four weeks. 
We got the police involved, but... 
she sent us a letter saying that she was fine, that she was travelling and she just needed some space. 
And when she came back... 
I was so grateful to see her that I stopped asking questions. 
No sense that anything had changed? 
Any fundamental difference? 
She had become less politically inclined. 
Marie had always flirted with causes, respectable causes. 
Like save the wilderness or abolish the death penalty. 
She stopped talking about all that. 
That's precisely what happens when you're radicalised. 
Handlers train you to stop talking about anything, keep it to yourself, so you're better able to blend in with the background. 
Marie had handlers? 
Hey, can it wait? I'll be right back with this. 
This scan came in from the mosque. A burnt 
paper fragment found in Ali's clothing. 
The only thing visible is in the lower left quadrant. 
It looks like a piece of a number. 
A six or an eight. 
Are all our forensics people out in the field? 
We got Murdoch on loan from San Diego. 
He's an expert with computer imaging. 
If anyone can see this, he can. 
 How are you doing? George Mason. 
 Hey, man. Randy Murdoch. 
 Pleased to meet you. 
 Good to meet you. 
 Any way to accelerate the process? 
 My CPU's faster than anything you got. 
Parallel processing could take too long to set up. If there's anything there, I'll get it. 
Great. Where's Tony 
and the satellite feed Jack wants? 
In progress. 
 Thank you. Keep it up. 
 All right. 
 Who else knew about the bomb? 
 I don't know what you�re talking about. 
Jack Bauer is interrogating Ali as we speak. 
We'll be informed of his progress on a minute-by-minute basis, but nothing yet. 
We're certain he knows the location of the bomb? 
 Jack Bauer is. 
 Make sure he has all the resources he needs. 
Yes, sir. 
The pain's only going to get much, much worse. 
You can stop it. 
Agent Simmons tells me that Roger received the same training of resisting interrogation he did. 
 I'm increasing the voltage. 
 But everyone breaks eventually. 
You have an entry point? 
She entered the forest somewhere between 8-3 and 8-4 on the topo map. 
 And heading? 
 No. No idea which way she was headed. 
 Keep me posted. 
 What are you doing? 
 Getting more men looking for Kim. 
 I told you to divert resources to the bomb. 
The satellite feed is happening. 
I was telling the sheriff to look for her. 
You're a resource. Don't split your attention. 
I promised Jack I'd do everything I could to look for Kim. Just like you did. 
Kim is outside the blast radius. 
The rest of Los Angeles isn't. 
Stay focused on the bomb, Tony! 
That goes for everybody! 
 LA County Ranger Station. 
 This is Tony Almeida at CTU. 
I'm trying to track somebody who went into the forest. 
Hold while I transfer you. 
Hey, somebody there? 
Hello? 
 Who are you? What are you doing here? 
 Me? What are you doing here? 
I got into a car accident. 
I started running, and before I knew it, I was out here. I had no idea where I was. 
I got stuck in this stupid thing. 
Look, all I wanna do is get back to the highway and get outta here. 
Why were you running from the highway in the first place? 
I told you, I was scared and panicked. 
Damm it. 
Oh, God. Thank you. 
Coming through here. 
We're moving into position now. Baker out. 
I know who you are. 
I know everything that you�ve done. 
Where is the bomb? 
Where's the bomb?! 
You are wasting my time. 
When is the bomb gonna detonate? 
You're the one wasting time. 
I woke up today knowing I will die. 
I can make you die with more pain than you ever imagined. 
Then I will have that much more pleasure in paradise. 
Right. 
We gotta figure out how to get you to the nearest ranger station. 
No, that's OK. I don't wanna go back there. 
The same reason you ran from the highway? 
Here, I got it. Thank you. 
The highway is a couple of miles that way. 
But the terrain's too rough to follow at night, and there's cougars up in that area. 
My place is a half-mile that way. 
I could put a roof over your head for the night. 
I am the imam of this mosque. 
Do you deny these men's accusations that you are planning to explode a bomb that will kill millions of people? 
The Koran clearly forbids the killing of innocents and non-combatants. 
You know this as well as I do. 
We have different interpretations of the Koran. 
You are misguided. 
Someone has twisted the words of the prophet. 
Allah does not love aggressors. 
Listen to me. The murder of one innocent, let 
alone millions, will not get you into paradise. 
We will continue this debate when I see you there, Imam Al Fulani. 
I want the images from this computer transferred to these monitors. 
I have talked to men who misuse our religion to channel their hate, but I have not known anyone who would act on their impulses. 
Can you make an appeal that'll make any difference? 
 I will try again, but I don't think so. 
 We don't have that kind of time. 
Please, I want to try again. 
You can't be involved with what's gonna happen next. 
Please escort the gentleman upstairs. 
 Agent Bauer? 
 Yeah. 
We recovered the last number Ali dialled on his cell. It's a 310 area code. 555-2130. 
 We're doing a workup on it now. 
 OK, good. 
Wait. What was that number? 
555-2130. 
No, that's not possible. 
That's my sister's cellphone number. 
What's going on? 
What are you not telling me? 
Why don�t you give us a minute? 
Reza and two of our agents were found shot to death in your father's building about an hour and a half ago. 
 What? 
 Your sister Marie was with them. 
 Marie? Is she OK? 
 They don't know where she is right now. 
When were you going to tell me? 
When we had confirmation that she was the person that pulled the trigger. 
What? That is ridiculous. 
How could you even think that? 
Because we have video tape on her. 
She was the only person seen leaving your father's building in the last hour and a half. 
She was probably trying to escape. 
She could have been hurt. 
You don't know if she picked up. 
The phone could have been stolen! 
You really believe your sister has nothing to do with this? 
Yes, I really believe it. 
There's one way you could prove that to me. Phone her cellphone. 
But if she picks up, you have to keep her on the phone so we can find her. 
That's the deal. Can you do that? 
OK. 
OK. 
OK. 
I'm gonna be right back. 
Baker? 
We need to trace a cellphone call. 
But manipulate the caller ID. 
We need to make it look like it's coming from Kate Warner's phone. Get on it now. 
Our equipment will make it look like you're calling from your cellphone. 
Tell her you're worried cos you haven't heard from her. 
We're linked into the cell-provider network. 
Once we lock, we can track the phone. 
OK, good. Let's make the call. 
What if it's not her? 
What if it's someone else? 
That's what we need to find out. 
Finding your sister right now could save the lives of millions of people. 
Please make the call. 
Hello? 
Hi. 
It's me. 
I haven't been able to reach Dad. 
He's not back yet. 
What's going on? 
Just taking a drive... to clear my head. 
I can understand. 
I'm so sorry, Marie, about everything. 
Yes. 
Do you want to meet back at the house? Grab a bite? 
Can you? 
They've found Reza, haven't they? 
They know what's happened. 
I don't know. I don't know what happened. 
Oh, Marie. 
Tell me, please, what happened? 
You wouldn't understand, Kate. 
You killed Reza? And those agents? 
People have to die for things to change. 
We're locked. 
You couldn't have done this. They forced you. 
You didn't know what you were doing. 
We tracked it to a ten-block section of Sylmar. 
Tell CHP to shut down that ten-block radius. 
Send vitals on Marie Warner. 
 Tell them to find her. 
 Got it. 
You don't know who she was with! 
They could have been forcing her. 
You don't know! 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 Any word back from the ranger station? 
 Nothing yet. They mounted a search. 
Tony. I just sent this to Jack 
over at the mosque. Check it out. 
This paper has a very irregular pulp pattern. 
The final step in the process is to take samples from various points, to create a CGI algorithm of what the paper looked like without any of the writings or other impressions on it. 
We then subtract that from what we've actually got, and what we get... 
is a representation of anything that interrupts that pattern. 
There it is. OK. This is only a partial. 
There are a few more markings. 
Letters or numbers to the right of these. 
But I need time. They're more obscure. 
Do we have any contacts whatsoever as to what these numbers and letters refer to? 
They photographed the paper on both sides. 
That's the only area with any information. 
All right. Good job. 
Michelle, get anyone we can spare on that sequence of letters and numbers. 
Check VIN numbers, licence plates. 
Also get crypto to see if that's a code. 
I'm on it. 
 Agent Bauer? 
 Yeah. 
This just came in from CTU. 
Open the door. Open the door! 
N34, what does that mean? 
What does that mean? 
You screwed up, Ali. 
We're gonna cross-reference that number in our database. 
Marie Warner is being picked up as we speak. 
The pieces are starting to come together. 
No matter what, we'll find this bomb. 
So you can either tell me now or I can make you suffer. 
You wanna suffer? 
I already told you. I'm not afraid to die. 
The only way you're gonna die today is if I kill you. Your bomb's not going off. 
 We have a live feed. 
 Patch it through. 
Go. 
Those men will kill your family if you don't tell me where the bomb is now. 
I despise you for making me do this. 
They're waiting for my order. 
This is your last chance. Where's the bomb? 
Sir. 
Are you aware Jack Bauer's threatening the lives of Syed Ali's family? 
No. 
 Where is the family? 
 In their own country. 
CTU's been in contact with the security forces there who have Ali's family in custody. 
We just got word that Jack has requested they kill the family one by one till Ali tells us the location of the bomb. 
 Would the security forces do this? 
 They do act against civilians. 
And their government is afraid of retaliation if a bomb does go off. Yes, I think they would. 
Can we let this happen? 
Condone the murder of innocent people? 
The bomb is an act of war and wars result in civilian casualties. 
I don't want a rationale here, Mike. 
I don't know of a war where a president targeted children. 
Compare this to a weapons factory near a hospital - a situation we have faced. 
A bombing would still be ordered on the logic that many more people will be saved by the destruction of the factory. 
The numbers are even more compelling here. 
A few people may have to die to save millions. 
How could it have come to this? 
Your wife's been writing you letters every day. 
She doesn't know where to send them. 
Your son Asad wants to grow up and be just like you. 
Turns 12 next week. 
I don't think he's gonna make it. 
I know what it's like to lose someone, to watch them get killed right in front of you. 
I don't wanna hurt your family. 
But I will order those men to pull that trigger if you don't give me the information I need. 
I am... 
I am doing Allah's work. 
No. You're going to kill millions of people, 
that's what you�re doing. 
Agent Bauer. 
It's important. It's the president. 
This is Jack Bauer. 
Can't let you do this, Jack. 
Sir, Ali was willing to take his own life to complete his mission. 
His only vulnerability is his family. 
It is not the policy of this country to kill innocent children. 
The action would take place in his country. 
You would not be involved. 
This would be a field decision. 
My decision is final. I'm sorry, Jack. 
Yes, sir. 
I understand, Mr President. 
No, I do not think that there is another alternative. 
I know it's a difficult decision, sir. 
Yes, sir. 
Thank you for your support, Mr President. 
He authorised the action. 
 Roger Stanton isn't available. 
 When can I talk to him? 
That's all I can say, Rich. 
If you have a tactical question, talk to Scott Grant. He's got the NSA playbook. 
 I can use your name? 
 Sure. 
Mike. Can I just have 
a quick word with you, please? 
Yeah, sure, Lynne. 
I don't trust Sherry Palmer. 
She shouldn't be here. 
I'm up to my eyeballs trying to hide this interrogation with Stanton from Washington. 
If you have a problem, deal with it yourself. 
I think you know me well enough to know this is not some battle over turf. 
 This is about Roger Stanton. 
 What? 
I was waiting for the appropriate time to tell you. I wanted to be sure. 
Someone has approached me with evidence of communications between Roger Stanton and Sherry Palmer, and it has been over the last six months. 
Roger said he met her today for the first time. 
Yes. I know. 
My God. 
You've known Sherry for a very long time. 
Is today indicative of how she operates? 
Then this shouldn't be too much of a shock to you. 
Sherry Palmer's a lot of things, but a traitor to this country? 
I don't believe that. 
What kind of communication? Phone calls? 
Yes. Phone calls, emails. Mike. 
Face to face. 
Who's your source on this? 
It's been through an intermediary, but I actually have a meeting with the source in about ten minutes. 
 Where? 
 Off site. 
 Are you telling the president? 
 No. He's got enough on his plate already. 
And he'd want proof, anyway. 
You go ahead with your meeting. 
Let me know what happens. 
 Be careful. 
 I will. Thank you. 
 Shall we proceed as planned? 
 Affirmative. Start with the older son, Asad. 
If that's not successful, move on to his younger son. 
 Copy that. Waiting for your orders. 
 We are a go. 
I can't wait any longer. 
Tell me where the bomb is or I will kill Asad. 
Ali, I know you think what you�re doing is right, but it's my job to not let it happen. 
Please don't make me do this. 
Asad is just a boy. Tell me where the bomb is! 
Tell me where the bomb is! Fine. 
Kill him! 
No! No! 
Tell me where the bomb is! 
 Tell me, and I'll spare your family! 
 I will not tell you! 
Your meeting's changed. Now it's with me. 
No, don't go anywhere, Lynne. 
We need to talk. 
 I don't think so. 
 Yes, we do. 
You think you've connected me to Roger. 
That's exactly what they want you to think. 
 Who is "they"? 
 The people Roger's conspiring with. 
So you're confirming that Roger Stanton is involved? He knew about this bomb? 
Roger's more involved than David could possibly know. 
What the hell does that mean? 
 This conspiracy, what is its goal, then? 
 To take over the presidency. 
These people are feeding you misinformation about me because they're afraid I'll get in the way. 
How did you know about this meeting? 
I don't have to be involved to know the moves. 
If you knew what Roger was doing, why haven�t you said anything? 
Probably for the same reasons you're keeping this line of inquiry to yourself. 
I want to have as much concrete evidence as possible. 
Sherry, you could have said any of this to me back at the retreat. Why come here? 
To make a point. That's all. 
To make a point? 
I think this is a warning. 
I think you orchestrated all of this to show me how powerful you are. 
You have your own and not the president's best interest at heart. 
I will do everything to make sure you don't hurt him or undermine this administration. 
Asad is dead. There's nothing 
I can do to change that. 
You can still save Fareed's life. 
I'll give you ten seconds. Where's the bomb? 
You're running out of time. 
I will tell these men to kill your last son! 
Where is the bomb? 
That's it. Take him out! 
 I will tell you! 
 Hold it. 
 I will tell you. 
 Tell me now! 
 It is at Norton Airfield. 
 Why? What's the plan? 
We were going to fly over downtown and detonate it. 
It is true. It is... it is true. 
 Dessler. 
 It's Jack. Get me Mason. 
It's Jack. 
What do you have? 
The bomb's at Norton Airfield. 
They're planning to fly it over the city. 
Norton's a medium-size airfield. 
They do cargo, private aviation. 
Every plane's tail number begins with the letter "N". That's probably what this refers to. 
OK. We're on our way. 
We're moving units Bravo, Echo and Lima to Norton Airfield, where we believe that the bomb is located. 
Call FAA and have them ground flights in or out of Norton. 
If they do get the plane in the air, we wanna have two F-16s at the ready to intercept. 
We'll get bomb units and SWAT teams over there as well, so just move. 
And, remember, the "no unnecessary contact" rule remains in place. 
Put Miss Warner against the wall. 
You killed my boy! 
You killed my boy! You killed my boy! 
I will get you for this! You will die for this! 
How could you? You're worse than they are. 
Reroute the satellite back to normal feed. 
I want confirmation. 
Rerouted satellite. 
You should have live picture now. 
Thank you. 
Hold this for me. 
We're gonna come in from the north. 
Set up our men coming in from the south from these two gates. 
He's alive. 
It was all an act. 
Kate, come with me, help me talk to your sister. 
What? Where? 
Norton Airfield. It's where the bomb's located. 
 Do you really think she's there? 
 Yes, I do. 
 Please, Kate, we don't have much time. 
 OK. 
Come on. 
Here you go, sir. 
Wake up. Stay with me, Mr Stanton. Wake up. 
There we go. Who else knew 
about the bomb, Mr Stanton? 
I need to speak with the president. 
They can't diffuse it. We'll have to fly it out. 
Ground zero has to be a precise location. 
A pilot will have to go down with the plane. 
It's a suicide mission. 
 Who ended up flying the plane? 
 Jack Bauer. 
 Get Air Force One ready as soon as possible. 
 Do you mind if I ask where you're going? 
Los Angeles. 
 Who's he? 
 His name is Yusuf Auda. 
His government assigned him as a liaison. 
They helped us get the hard drive from Ali. 
It's a recording of a conversation that took place four months ago. 
 Conversation between who? 
 Ali and highranking government officials. 
These countries not only knew about the bomb,  but they bought it and supplied it to Ali? 
 Yeah. 
 Kim? 
 Daddy. What's that noise? Where are you? 
I'm in a plane. We found the bomb. 
We needed someone to fly it over the desert, so when it exploded nobody would get killed. 
 That someone turned out to be me. 
 No, Daddy. 
I love you more than anything in the world. Goodbye. 
 George, what the hell are you doing here? 
 Brought something for ya. It's a parachute. 
I already told you, I'm taking this plane in. 
You still got a life, Jack. 
What's left but going straight and level and taking it into a dive? Am I right? 
 You really think you can do this? 
 Jack, I'm supposed to do this. 
Oh, Dad. 
Agent Bauer. 
 My orders are to take you back to CTU, sir. 
 That's affirmative. 
Lieutenant, I need you to get ahold of Tony Almeida over at CTU. Tell him that I made it. 
He needs to get ahold of my daughter, tell her I'm alive. 
Radio transmissions are a no-go, and cell sites are down for miles. 
 You'll have to wait till we get there. 
 Copy. 
Would everyone gather around, please? 
This will just take a minute. 
George Mason asked me in advance to thank you all for your dedication. 
Thanks to his sacrifice and your hard work, millions of lives were saved. 
And that's a result that we can be proud of. 
To say that this has been a long day would be an understatement, and I know you're all tired, but this isn't over yet. 
We still got a lot of work to do. 
The Cyprus recording is our primary focus. 
And that's critical to any military response that Washington's considering. 
So let's get back at it, huh? 
Mr Almeida? 
I'm supposed to update my office right now. 
But I've got nothing to report except that I've been excluded from this investigation. 
Look, I'll tell you what I can when I can. 
My country permitted your operatives to raid Ali's apartment on condition that I would be involved in this investigation. 
I understand your frustration, Mr Auda. 
You can call your office and tell them anything you like. 
But we've got work to do here. 
You're simply not authorised to be part of it. 
 He doesn't look too happy. 
 Yeah. Are the audio guys ready? 
They're waiting for you. Where's Michelle? 
 Interrogating Ali. 
 Why? 
To see if he can shed any light on the recording. We have a meeting. 
The president's waiting for confirmation on the recording's authenticity. Take care of it? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
This tape was recovered from the hard drive in your apartment. 
It's a record of a meeting you had with these three men on April 5 in Cyprus. 
They're all high-ranking officials from three Arab countries, one of them your own. 
The tape proves you conspired with these men to detonate a nuclear bomb on US soil. 
Were there others present who didn't speak? 
You'll tell the interrogators in Guantanamo, under much less comfortable circumstances. I'll ask you one more time. 
 Tell me what you want me to say, I'll say it. 
 I want the truth. 
What does the truth matter when you have this... recording? 
 Explain what that means. 
 I never spoke to any of these men. 
Are you denying that the meeting took place? 
There was never a meeting. 
I was not even in Cyprus in April. 
 Where were you? 
 Berlin. 
They'll find out the truth in Guantanamo. 
Why would I lie about this, when I told you the truth about the bomb? 
To protect your country. 
The bomb was a Second Wave operation only. 
I have never met those men. 
Agent Gibson, your team has finished the analysis of the Cyprus recording? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Could you walk us through it, please? 
We began by obtaining voice samples for Ali and the three government officials. 
We deconstructed sound waves and isolated unique qualities. 
The voices on the Cyprus audio are in fact those of Syed Ali and the three government ministers in question. 
The recording could have been created by putting pieces of conversations together? 
Yes, but reconstruction always leaves artefacts, mismatched acoustical signatures or altered cadences. We found no such artefacts. 
Is there any chance that it could have been doctored in a way we couldn't detect? 
Anything's theoretically possible. 
But I can say with absolute certainty that the finest experts, using the best equipment, cannot find any evidence that this recording is anything but a genuine and accurate record of an actual conversation. 
A conversation in which these four men sat in the same room and conspired to detonate a nuclear bomb on US soil? 
Yes, sir. 
I just finished talking with Ali. 
He claims that he's never even spoken to any of the men in the recording. 
He says it's a complete fabrication, and that he was in Berlin on April 5, not Cyprus. 
 He could be telling the truth. 
 He still thinks we killed one of his sons. 
He's trying to save his family by denying that his country's behind the nuke. 
I agree he has a motive to lie, but if there's any possibility he's telling the truth,  I think we need to investigate. 
 But he's not. 
 I mean, it's obvious. 
 It's not obvious to me. 
The evidence versus the word of an attempted mass murderer? It's clear which wins. 
 Carrie. 
 And, no offence, Michelle, but your experience as an interrogator is limited. 
 That's enough. 
 I sat three feet away from him, and I believe he is a broken man without the strength or resolve to lie. 
I'll tell the president what Ali said when I call him to pass on Agent Gibson's findings. 
Now, if we don't have anything else here, I think we're finished, right? Thank you. 
CTU managed to detonate the bomb within a few metres of the coordinates. 
I'm going over the field report now. 
I'm not seeing any casualty estimates. 
We expect zero direct casualties, or close to it. 
Hmm. 
I want to give Bauer's daughter personal condolences. 
You won't have to, sir. 
Bauer wasn't on the plane at the time the bomb was detonated. 
 Do we know how this happened? 
 Another man ended up piloting the plane. 
We're still getting the details. 
Sir? We just got word from CTU. 
They finished their analysis of the Cyprus audio. 
It's real. And we have proof that Syed Ali, 
the man behind the bomb, was given support from the three different countries. 
Here's the transcript of their analysis... 
including margins of error. 
Do we have any reason to doubt the veracity of this? 
Ali is denying it, but I suppose that's to be expected. 
 Are the Joint Chiefs ready? 
 General Bowden has them on standby. 
Given the evidence, we don't have the option of not responding. 
I don't see any way around this. Do you? 
I want to issue a statement that there was a nuclear weapon, but there were no casualties. 
I will alert the networks, sir. 
And contact the Hill. 
Let them know I'll be calling for an emergency session of Congress. 
During which, I'll be asking them for a formal declaration of war. 
Chappelle wants to see your report. 
I'm ordering more data points. 
I need another 15 minutes. 
Fine. 
 You all right? 
 Just a little tired, like everyone else. 
No, I mean, about before. 
 It got tense between you and Carrie. 
 I can handle Carrie. 
You don't have the training or the experience to read a guy like Ali. 
 I shouldn't have put you in that position. 
 We should press him. 
 They will in Guantanamo. 
 It may be too late. 
We're sending him now. I'm heading over 
to make sure the hand-off goes as planned. 
OK. 
General Bowden, my understanding is it'll take between eight and ten weeks to call up reserve troops and redeploy forces for a full-scale ground assault. 
We have the resources in place to initiate a rolling start immediately. 
Rolling start? 
Surgical strikes against early-warning radar and anti-aircraft installations, followed immediately by bombing of targets that will degrade their military and telecommunications capabilities. 
Can these first strikes be underway by the time I address the nation this morning? 
 When are you scheduled to go on the air? 
 Six hours from now. 
We'll be ready, sir. 
Mr President. 
Gentlemen, ladies, would you hold, please? 
Deputy Prime Minister Barghouti is calling. 
It's his second call since the bomb was detonated. 
We're well past the point of words. 
We're about to invade his country. 
But he doesn't know that yet. If you don't 
take his call, he may read between the lines. 
 Mr Deputy Prime Minister. 
 Thank you for taking my call. 
The Prime Minister wanted me to express his outrage for what has occurred. 
 Thank you. 
 That you found the bomb is truly a miracle. 
I'm not sure I believe in miracles, sir. 
 My people are good at what they do. 
 Indeed they are. 
I'm sure you're aware that we've arrested one of your citizens in connection to it. 
 Syed Ali. 
 An outlaw. He has eluded us for years. 
Expect our full cooperation with his punishment. 
I would expect nothing less. 
I realise we've had our differences, and today has been an especially trying day, but we are both fighting the same battle. 
My government remains dedicated to the destruction of Second Wave, as well as any other terrorist organisation that may have been responsible for this atrocity. 
That's good to know. 
I understand you will be under a great deal of political pressure to respond to what has happened. 
I'm confident that you have the strength to resist. 
Don't be concerned about a rush to judgment. 
We're merely gathering evidence. 
 I appreciate your candour, Mr President. 
 And I appreciate your solidarity. 
 Of course. 
 You'll hear from me soon. 
Come on, let's go. 
 Hey, Jack. I'm glad you're OK. 
 Thanks. 
I'll get out of your way. 
How can I get ahold of Kim? 
I spoke to a Sergeant Griggs with the San Jose Sheriffs Department. 
He sent a man to your sister-in-law's to meet Kim. That's his number. 
OK, thanks. 
 George told me he put you in charge. 
 Yeah. How about that, huh? 
Trial by fire, right? 
 You're gonna do great. 
 Look, we'll catch up later, all right? 
Yeah. 
 Sheriff's Department. 
 Is Griggs there? 
 I can help. 
 I need to speak with him. 
 He's not here. 
 Is this not his personal line? 
 What is this regarding? 
 I'm Jack Bauer. 
 It's regarding my daughter. 
 Sergeant Griggs isn't available. 
If your daughter is in any danger, let me assist you. 
No, she's not in any immediate danger. 
Listen, ma'am... 
Fine, just give me the number. 
 Same area code, 5559464. 
 OK. 
 I'm glad you're OK, Jack. 
 Thanks. 
I know Tony's running things, and I don't want to speak out of turn, but... 
 I don't know who to talk to. 
 About what? 
The president's planning military action based on a recording from Ali's apartment. 
It links officials from three governments to the nuke. 
The problem is... Ali claims it was a fake. 
 And you believe him. 
 I don't know. 
We ought to be sure before we retaliate against them. 
That's Tony's call. 
I'm trying to get ahold of my daughter. 
I understand, but you�re the one who broke Ali. 
You can read him better than anyone here. 
Please, Jack, before Ali is gone. 
Only he can prove whether the recording is real. 
Fine, I'll talk to him. 
See if you can get ahold of this Sergeant Griggs. Tell him it's regarding my daughter. 
 Sheriff's Department. 
 This is Michelle Dessler over at CTU. 
 I'm looking for Sergeant Griggs. 
 Please hold. 
There you go. 
Bring him out. 
I just wanna talk to him before they get him to Guantanamo. 
Gentlemen... hold up. 
Let me have a word with the prisoner. 
I want you to know we didn't kill your son. We staged it. 
When you get to Guantanamo, they'll let you speak with your family. 
I need to know something. 
The Cyprus recording, is it fake? 
What I told the woman was true. 
Thank you. 
We got shots fired on the north roof! 
Get back here. He's dead. 
You got a radio on you? 
Tell them inside, Syed Ali has just been shot. 
We've got a shooter on one of the southwest roofs. Tell 'em now! 
This is Primary Escort. We have 
a prisoner down and a sniper on the roof. 
Would you take care of that for me? 
 LAPD say the perimeter's set up. 
 How'd anybody know we were moving him? 
Intelligence knew we had him. 
The leak could have come from anywhere. 
Shooter's gotta be connected to a country implicated on the recording. 
 Maybe. 
 They had the most to lose by Ali talking. 
 Who else would it have been? 
 Ali might have been telling the truth. 
 You talked to Michelle. 
 No, I talked to Ali. 
 Captain Raskind from LAPD for you. 
 One minute, please. 
You're taking Syed Ali's word over every expert we have? 
Tony, Ali was killed for a reason. 
Find out if it was cos he could prove the recording was fabricated. 
 Our best people have verified it. 
 Fine. 
 Keep the door open, assign men to it. 
 I don't have any men to spare. 
We're processing intel from nine countries, and I think this is a dead end. 
 Captain Raskind wants to know... 
 Could you give me a minute? 
Thank you. 
Tony, the president is gonna make some very, very serious decisions based on the information that he got from that recording. 
If it's not genuine, you have a responsibility... 
You're gonna lecture me on responsibility? 
We both know how you work. You consider 
going against the grain some kind of a virtue. 
 Why are you talking to me like this? 
 I got a job to do, I don't wanna be told how. 
I'm just trying to help. 
I don't need your help, Jack. 
Don't get me wrong, I appreciate everything you've done for us today. 
But I think it's time you go get your daughter, let us handle the rest of this. 
Yeah, fine. 
 Thanks. Yeah. 
 Mr Almeida... 
All circuits are busy. 
Please try your call again. 
Some kind of problem? 
Can I just use the bathroom? 
 Please, I'll be quick. 
 All right, come on. 
In the back, on your left. Watch your step. 
Casualty estimates for the initial air campaign are minimal. A dozen at most. 
 And the ground campaign? 
 There are numerous scenarios, depending on how long the campaign lasts, if chemical or biological weapons are deployed against our troops. 
Which, frankly, I think they will be. 
OK, take that all into account, then give me a number, General. 
A simultaneous ground assault against the three countries, which lasts five weeks, will result in ten to thirty thousand American casualties. 
And if China and Russia enter the conflict against us? 
There's no upper limit to that number, Mr President. 
But it's unlikely. They'll want to insinuate 
themselves into control of the oil fields. 
 Yes. 
 I have Jack Bauer. It's an emergency. 
One moment. 
Sir, it's Jack Bauer for you. 
Excuse me again. 
It's good to hear your voice, but I'm in a meeting with the Joint Chiefs. 
I felt this was important enough to interrupt you. 
Syed Ali has just been assassinated. 
CTU was transferring him over to Guantanamo when it happened. 
 What are you talking about? By whom? 
 We don't know yet, sir. 
I think it has to do with the conversation recorded in Cyprus. 
Mr President, I don't believe it's genuine. 
 That recording was authenticated. 
 Sir, authentication is never 100 per cent. 
Do you have evidence? 
Ali said he was in Berlin when the conversation took place. 
 He said the recording was fabricated. 
 OK, I'm aware of his denials. 
Mr President, I'm worried that someone is trying to manipulate you into taking the kind of military action I assume you're about to take. 
Look, the fact that Syed Ali was killed does not prove that the recording was fabricated. 
No, sir. I know that. I know it doesn't. 
But I feel a responsibility to tell you I believe he was assassinated because he was in fact telling the truth. 
Do you have any hard evidence, Jack? 
Aside from Ali's denials, no, sir. 
Nothing concrete. 
Listen to me. I don't wanna initiate a military 
action based on erroneous information. 
 But I can't stop it based on conjecture. 
 I understand, sir, I do. 
If I were to get you proof, how much time would I have? 
Our military response is only hours away, Jack. 
 You better do it soon. 
 Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr President. 
We don't have any updates. As soon 
as we do, we'll patch them through to you. 
 This is Dessler. 
 Michelle, it's Jack. 
I want you to keep this information between us, OK? 
I talked to the president. He will not halt 
any military action unless we provide proof. 
Ali was our only proof. 
There's gotta be another way to establish Ali's presence at that time. 
Other foreign agencies must have been tracking him. 
 An official from a target country is here. 
 What? Here at CTU? Why? 
We struck an agreement earlier today. 
He's the one who escorted evidence from Ali's apartment. 
 Think he knows something? 
 He might. 
Tony doesn't want him talking to anyone. 
 OK, fine, what's his name? 
 Yusuf Auda. AUDA. 
I'll pull up his CV and run a background check. I'll get back to you. 
 Jack? 
 Kate. 
I didn't think... 
I thought you weren't coming back. 
I didn't think I was either. 
 How? 
 It's a long story. 
But everything's OK, right? 
They said the bomb was detonated safely. 
No. Everything's fine. It's gonna be fine. 
How are you? Are you OK? 
Yeah. My dad's still a little shaken up. 
I'm sorry. 
 Miss Warner. 
 I have to go. 
 She needs to be debriefed. 
 OK. We'll see you in a little while. 
 I'm really glad you're OK. 
 Thanks. 
The Joint Chiefs are revising down their material estimate between 10 and 20 per cent. 
 That's good news, sir. 
 None of this is good news, Mike. 
General Bowden is ready to walk you through the strategy statement. 
 I need a few more minutes. 
 How long should I tell him? 
When I'm ready, Mike. 
What is it, Mr President? 
The telephone conversation with Jack Bauer keeps playing in my head. 
I'm worried that we may be moving too fast. 
Mr President, your ability to analyse a situation is your strongest asset. 
But it's also your greatest liability. 
I don't wanna make a mistake that our children and their children will pay for. 
Sir, we have evidence that's been confirmed by every military and intelligence expert on the payroll. 
Everyone except Jack Bauer. 
It's natural for you to be having doubts. 
I'd be worried if you weren't having doubts. 
But when the public learns what happened, they'll want a decisive response. 
They'll demand it. 
We're not responding to satisfy bloodlust. 
No, sir, we're not. 
We're responding because three countries colluded with a terrorist group to explode a nuclear bomb on our soil. 
 And we have proof. 
 What if the proof is a lie? 
 It isn't. 
 Are you sure, Mike? 
Are you sure? 
I'll tell General Bowden you'll call... 
when you're ready. 
 Mr Auda, my name is Jack Bauer. 
 Don't give me another excuse. 
I need to ask you a few questions about the evidence taken from Syed Ali's apartment. 
How would I know what was found? 
You people refuse to include me. Ask them. 
My colleagues might not be interested in the same questions that I am. 
I'm trying to determine whether or not the evidence could've been compromised. 
Before I tell you anything, tell me what you know. 
Whatever was found, they're keeping it from me, suggesting it incriminates my country. 
I'm sorry. You and I are not even 
supposed to be talking. 
You're asking me to help, offering nothing in return. 
 I know I'm asking a lot. 
 Asking too much. 
This is Bauer. 
 Hello, Jack. 
 Who is this? 
The only person who can prove Syed Ali was not in Cyprus in April, meeting Arab leaders. 
The recording they found, in case you haven't figured it out, is bogus. 
 How do you know that? 
 Because I'm the one who planted it. 
 On April 5, I placed it in Ali's apartment. 
 And I'm supposed to believe you? 
You don't have a choice. That's why I killed 
Ali, so you'd have to deal with me. 
 How do I know you killed him? 
 I almost had to take you out too. 
But you moved. I'm dying to know 
what you two were talking about. 
 What do you want? 
 Kate Warner. 
Why? Why do you want her? 
Get her out of CTU. Bring her to the 
intersection of Meridian and Moorpark. 
There's a warehouse. 
Look for a door under a neon sign. 
 My access at CTU is limited at best. 
 You're resourceful. You'll find a way. 
 You didn't answer. Why do you want her? 
 Don't worry about that now. 
She hasn't been released. 
She's in debriefing. 
You got 30 minutes. 
Bring her to the warehouse. 
30 minutes is not enough time. 
What's the problem? 
You'll have a problem if you don't get out. I'll call the cops. 
It's nothing like that! 
I just need a few things! 
Will you lighten up? My wife's pregnant. 
Here's some money. 
 I'll be quick. 
 Keep moving. 
 You have to help me. 
 Sorry, I can't do anything. 
 I'll pay you, all right? How much? 
 I don't... 
 Don't walk away! 
 Just find another store. 
How hard would it be to open up for one minute?! 
There's another store ten miles down the road, west on Route 14. 
 No, we're going to the mountains! 
 I'm closed. I'm not gonna tell you again. 
 Don�t you know what's going on?! 
 I'm calling the cops. 
 Look, I have cash. I'll pay you double. 
 I already closed out the register. 
Please, tell him to let me in. 
My wife's pregnant. She can't be here. 
 Look, open the damn door! 
 That's it. That is it. 
 Come on! 
 911? 
Some guy's trying to bust into my store. 
 Is the store open? 
 No, but he's threatening me. 
 What's your location? 
 It's King's Liquor, Soledad Canyon Road. 
Officers are on their way. 
They always come out at night. 
All kinds of crazy people. 
 It's starting. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 Don't give me that. 
"It's starting." What the hell's 
that supposed to mean? 
No! Stop it! 
Stop! 
You should have let me in. 
I told you to let me in! 
Let go of him and get up! 
I said, let go of him! 
Now get out of here! 
I didn't mean for this to happen. 
I'm just trying to get to the mountains. 
I said, go! 
Give me the gun. 
 I'm not gonna hurt anyone, I promise. 
 Just go. 
Go! 
 Michelle Dessler. 
 Hey, it's me, Jack. 
 Was Yusuf Auda helpful? 
 No, not yet. He's got some trust issues. 
I'm right behind you. 
I think there�s another way to prove that the Cyprus recording was faked. 
But I'm gonna need your help  you're gonna have to trust me. 
 Yeah, whatever you need. 
 OK, I'll get back to you in a minute. 
You should have let me in when I asked you. 
My wife is seven months pregnant. 
 I didn't want to hurt anyone. 
 Just go. 
After I pay. I told you I had money, 
I didn't come here to steal. 
 I said, I wanna pay! 
 All right, all right, all right. 
I'm not a criminal. 
Turn on the TV. 
Speculation has continued to grow around the explosion spotted by two commercial aircraft and a weather satellite. 
While a statement from the president is forthcoming, one source suggested that the blast could only have been caused by a nuclear explosion. 
It's true. My brother works 
at a USGS station in Palmdale. 
 He overheard a scientist talking. 
 You knew about this, didn�t you? 
 Keep your hands where I can see them. 
 Hey, leave her alone! 
Give me the gun. 
No. 
Put the gun down and come out with your hands up. 
I said, put the gun down and come out with your hands up. 
How long did the two men talk? 
Just for a few minutes at a time. 
And it was mostly in Arabic, which I understand a little bit. 
They didn't seem... 
too much in a hurry about anything. 
Do you think that they knew each other well? 
 Yeah, like they were partners. 
 Baker? 
 Yeah. 
 You did the Macauley interview last week? 
I did. 
A page is missing from the transcript. 
Have a copy of the original? 
 Yeah, but I have another hour here. 
 Can't wait. Division wants it right now. 
 I'm glad I doublechecked before it got sent. 
 Sorry, I'll be right back. 
OK. 
I need you to come with me now. 
I'm still with Baker, then I have to deal with my father. 
 This is urgent. 
 What's going on? 
You said everything was fine. 
It's not. I'll explain in the car. 
 Almeida. 
 Yeah, it's Carrie. 
 What's up? 
 Unless I'm misreading the situation,  Jack is trying to remove Kate from CTU. 
 I'll be right down. 
Oh, God! 
 Come on. 
 I didn't mean to! He came at me! 
Please don't let him die! 
Look, I didn't mean for this to happen! 
It was a mistake! 
I was just trying to protect my wife. 
 Lower level, space eleven. 
 Thanks, Brian. Come on, Kate. 
 Where the hell you going? 
 I don't have time to explain. 
 Let's find the time. 
 What are you doing? 
Kate, you stay against the wall. 
Tony, put down the gun. 
Not till you tell me what you�re doing, Jack. 
I'm sorry, I can't. 
Who do you think you're kidding? You're 
not gonna shoot me. Put the gun down. 
Put the gun down. 
Kate, come on, we gotta go. 
Now. Let's go. 
Jack! Jack! 
You may not be able to contact me. 
 Why? 
 Chappelle became a problem. 
I had to take him out of play and they're onto me. 
 They'll take me out soon. 
 Who do I contact if I need help? 
Michelle is setting up an off-site station. 
 You're under arrest. Where's Dessler? 
 I can find her. 
Affirmative, Central. She's in custody. 
Kim? Hello? 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Kate Warner. 
Your father sent me to come get you. 
Why would my dad send someone he'd just met to come get me? 
He trusts me. 
The sooner we leave, the sooner you and your dad can be together. 
The Attorney General said you'd want me for your counsel. 
 What have they told you? 
 You've been removed from office. 
The evidence was manipulated by a man named Peter Kingsley. 
I need you to find out all you can about him. 
 What happens now? 
 We got one last play. Deliver Kingsley. 
He's far too dangerous, and you'll never get close to him. 
You're right. I won't, but you will. 
Kingsley doesn't know Hewitt's been killed. 
If you say you can deliver him, that should get his attention. 
I want the tapes that you made of our conversation. 
I'll give you Alex Hewitt in return. 
All right. LA Coliseum, gate 18, 30 minutes. 
 What support will you get from CTU? 
 As of now, none. Ow! 
Jack? Jack! 
 You OK? 
 Yeah. 
Come on. 
Damn it. The car won't start. 
We gotta get out of here. 
My seat belt's jammed. 
Mrs Palmer, I'm gonna need your help. 
Mrs Palmer, please don't do this. 
I'm sorry, but I have to take care of myself. 
When I'm free I'll call an ambulance. 
 You can't do this! 
 I don't have a choice. 
You're a very impressive man, but you see everything as either good or bad, just like David. 
 The world is so much more complicated. 
 No, it's simple. 
There's a war about to start and you're the only person who can help me stop it. 
 What about the president? 
 He turned away from me. 
After 25 years of building a life together, a family, he turned me away. 
Eventually they will connect you to this conspiracy. 
That bomb was never supposed to go off. 
None of this was supposed to happen this way. 
I know. I believe you. 
You can put an end to it now. 
If you help me get Kingsley, your husband will get his presidency back. 
That will be because of you. 
Mrs Palmer, please. 
God damn it! 
What do you want me to do? 
There's a knife in the glove box. 
Help cut me out. 
Come on in. 
This is much better. It's simpler. 
We gotta be able to explain this thing. 
 I need to talk to you, Mike. 
 I'll be down in five minutes. 
Mike. 
It's important. 
Excuse me. 
What is it? 
It's a file on Peter Kingsley. 
They pulled it up a few minutes ago. 
Peter Kingsley, the man Jack Bauer thinks is behind the bomb. 
There's a record of phone calls he made, as recently as six hours ago, to a soldier named Jonathan Wallace. 
Wallace was a member of the Coral Snake brigade. 
He apparently killed his own men. 
I know who Wallace is. 
The planes have passed over their final checkpoint and will reach their targets within the hour. 
Our primary targets are all military, but one includes a command-and-control centre inside a residential area. 
As smart as our weapons have become, there may be some collateral damage. 
You mean civilian casualties. 
Yes, sir. 
 There's no way to avoid these? 
 I'm afraid not. 
Then it's something we're just gonna have to live with. 
Ryan Chappelle. 
 Ryan, this is Mike Novick. 
 How can I help you, sir? 
I know there�s been some confusion today about the veracity of the Cyprus audio. 
Not really. Our teams came 
to the same conclusion as Langley. 
Do you know if Bauer's still trying to find evidence that the recording was fabricated? 
Yes, but he's operating outside our authority. 
I want you to assist his investigation. 
 Sir, I don't even know where he is. 
 Then find him. 
I'm not sure why you're asking me to do this. 
I was told we're at war and to proceed accordingly. 
We're not at war yet. 
You have 30 minutes to report back to me the findings of Bauer and your efforts. 
 But sir... 
 That's a direct order, Ryan. 
You have my channel. 
Call me back on this line. That's all. 
 I'll be on the plane in an hour. 
 Why the delay? 
The bomb detonating in the wrong location created a little extra work. 
Nothing to worry about, I hope. 
Not at all. I won't bore you with the details. 
Bore me. 
I still have to take care of Alex Hewitt. 
Hewitt is the only one who can bring this whole thing down. 
 You told me you'd have him by now. 
 I wasn't able to find him. 
But I'm taking care of it. Don't worry. 
Sit down, both of you. 
You don't need Michelle here. 
She was acting under my orders. 
 I can defend myself, Tony. 
 I said sit down. 
I need you to get me in contact with Jack Bauer. 
Oh, I see. Jack got some support above you 
and now you're being squeezed, right? 
Can you do it or not? 
What's goin' on? 
Bauer's evidence might actually have some relevance. 
 Which means we were right. 
 No. You damn near put me in a coma. 
That's assault. 
I'll tell you what. 
You drop the charges against us... 
and we'll help you. 
Come on, Ryan. You of all people 
know that�s your best move. 
 Fine. 
 In writing. 
All right, in writing. 
Just get me in touch with Bauer. 
 Shouldn't we call for help? 
 I'm not working under CTU's authority. 
 To them I don't exist. 
 So we're out on our own. 
Completely. 
 Are you all right? You need some help? 
 He got hurt. 
 Can you get us to a hospital? 
 Uh, yeah, yeah, sure. 
 Mrs Palmer, you need to drive. 
 What do you mean? 
 Sorry, but we need your car. 
 Hey, easy, all right? Go ahead, take it. 
Thank you. 
They're ready, sir. 
 Miss Warner. Hi. Carrie Turner. 
 Hi. Kate. 
 You must be Jack's daughter Kim. 
 Where's my dad? 
He's still in the field. Wait here. 
I'll tell Ryan Chappelle you're here. 
 I'll handle this. 
 I thought you were in custody. 
I was released. 
Kim, I heard what happened to you. 
Are you all right? 
Yeah, I guess so. Look, I just wanna see 
my dad and make sure he's OK. 
No, he's not here right now. 
He won't be back for a couple of hours. 
 Does he know I'm here? 
 No. We'll tell him when he phones in. 
 Jack insisted we call as soon as we get here. 
 He's just not reachable now. 
I'll have Carrie take you back and get you situated. I'll be there in a minute. 
Hey. 
It's gonna be OK. 
OK. 
Miss Warner? 
I don't know if you're aware of this but... 
your father came back here after we released him. 
Why? 
He wanted to talk to your sister before she was taken away. 
 They brought Marie back here? 
 Yeah. 
You lied to me? 
You killed Reza? 
You tried to kill your own sister? 
You were willing to set off a nuclear bomb in a city with ten million people? 
You tell me why. 
Because I need to understand. 
Tell me that they forced you to do it, that they brainwashed you, that they threatened you. 
You can tell me that you didn't know what you were doin'. 
There must be a reason. 
There is no reason, Dad. 
I can't accept that. 
I couldn't either. 
Until I looked into her eyes and she pointed a gun at me and started to pull the trigger. 
Trust me, Dad. 
She's not gonna give you any answers. 
She can't. At least, nothing 
that we could ever understand. 
Dad... 
Come on. Let's go. 
Kate. 
You think you'll be safe out there. 
You won't be. 
 Jack, it's Tony. 
 Tony, you back in play? 
Yeah. Jack, Kim's here at CTU. 
 She's safe. 
 Thank God. Don't tell her what's going on. 
 Just say I'll be back as soon as I can. 
 I will. 
 Jack, this is Ryan. We need to talk. 
 You son of a bitch. 
You stopped that chopper picking up me and Hewitt. 
 Hewitt's dead. I hold you responsible. 
 Listen, things have changed. 
You got full support. 
Give me your mission profile. 
I've set up a meeting with Kingsley. 
We're gonna meet him at the LA Coliseum, gate 18. 
Mrs Palmer will wear a wire and make him confirm that the three countries had nothing to do with the nuke. 
Stand down until you get some support. 
Our people will be there soon. 
We don't have time. Kingsley's 
expecting the meet to go down now. 
You need backup. 
If you wanna help me, get me voice prints of Kingsley and Mrs Palmer for authentication. 
Done. 
 And a live audio feed to the White House. 
 You want an audience with the president. 
Yes. 
All right. Keep the line clear. 
 Copy. We're pulling into the Coliseum now. 
 We need to get a SWAT team to his location. 
Pull over there. 
Wait here for me. 
Come on. 
Let's get you wired. 
Take your jacket off your shoulder. 
This is a wireless transmitter. 
They won't know to look for it. 
They won't be able to trace it. 
 This is crazy. We shouldn't do this alone. 
 We don't have another choice. 
Remember, Kingsley doesn't want to leave here without Hewitt. 
That's gotta be to our advantage. 
OK, say something. 
I'm scared. 
OK, it's working. 
 Yes, Mike. 
 Mr President, I am against any delay in our military actions. 
I have been from the start. 
But there is a good chance we'll receive evidence soon the Cyprus recording is false. 
We know Second Wave brought the nuke into the country and we know they're sponsored by these three countries. What am I missing? 
I don't have all the details, but I just learned about a possible link between Second Wave and a man named Peter Kingsley. 
Who is he? 
He's apparently part of a consortium of oil interests with contracts in the Caspian Sea. 
An oil consortium's behind the nuke? 
Bauer believes he can get a confession from Kingsley. He's set up a live audio feed. 
Our bombers are due to drop their payloads in less than 20 minutes. 
Bauer's meeting Kingsley any minute. 
This is the live voice print. 
And this is the voice file we have on record which will prove that it is, in fact, Sherry Palmer. 
 It's confirmed. 
 The one below is Kingsley? 
 Yeah. 
 Are you guys getting this? 
 We're good here. 
 How far out is our backup? 
 They're 11 minutes out. 
 That's too long. We've gotta go now. 
 Just wait. 
 We can't. 
We're already ten minutes past the meeting time. Is Prescott ready? 
Tony's on with the White House. 
They're setting up a live audio feed. 
OK, good. We are set to go. 
How are you doing, Mrs Palmer? 
What's to prevent Kingsley from shooting me? 
He won't do anything until he gets Hewitt. 
But the moment he realises we don't have Hewitt... 
I'll be covering your back. 
That's not very comforting considering the condition you're in. 
I may not make it out of this. 
I'm not gonna lie to you, Mrs Palmer. 
That's a possibility. 
I'm doing this for David. 
You know that, don�t you? 
Yes. 
Will you tell him that? 
In case something happens. 
I'll take care of it, Mrs Palmer. 
You've gotta go now. 
 Mike. 
 Yes, sir. 
We just finished setting up the feed. 
I hope this isn't gonna be a waste of our time. 
Believe me, Mr President, so do I. 
What's going on, Mike? 
The president and I thought you should be part of this. 
Along with Prescott and the Attorney General, we will be listening to a live feed. 
 Of what? 
 A sting operation against Peter Kingsley. 
It appears he was the architect of today's bombing and the delivery of the Cyprus audio. 
 Bauer found Kingsley. 
 Yes. 
But... it won't be Bauer 
who'll be talking to Kingsley. 
What difference does it make as long as we get him to incriminate himself? 
What is it, Mike? 
It's Sherry who'll be talking to Kingsley. 
I don't understand. 
It seems that Kingsley recruited her some months ago. 
She was part of this. 
Sherry was working with this man, Kingsley? 
It appears that way, sir. 
To detonate a nuclear bomb and start a war? 
No. 
It's unclear how much she knew, or how deep she was in it. 
We just have to hope she can extract a confession from Kingsley. 
So now Sherry is working with Jack Bauer to bring down Kingsley? 
Yes. And at considerable risk to herself. 
Scott, don't do anything until I tell you to. 
 We need Hewitt. 
 Understood. 
 Where's Hewitt? 
 He's safe. 
Where is he? 
You lied to me. You wanted 
this bomb to go off all along. 
You used Roger Stanton and you used me. 
Yes, I did. 
Well, now I'm tied to you, and the nuclear detonation. I want safe haven. 
 That's your problem. 
 Well, I just made it yours. 
Because you won't see Hewitt until I'm safe. 
 Don't horse trade with me. 
 Don't insult my intelligence. 
 We got a match on Kingsley's voice. 
 Ryan, you got it. 
You're not going anywhere till I have Hewitt. 
That doesn't work for me. 
I'll call you on this line to give you Hewitt's location after I'm safely away. 
You don't need to know where I'm going. 
 We're not getting what we need here. 
 She'll get it for you. 
 Now there�s the matter of the recordings. 
 They're right here. 
Every phone conversation between you and me. 
No. I want all of them, including Cyprus. 
Why Cyprus? 
You had nothing to do with that. 
 Insurance. 
 Insurance? 
Once the country goes to war, the government will never let that be exposed. 
Hewitt is the only one who can hurt us. 
 Because he forged the Cyprus recording. 
 Right. 
 You got your proof. Let me go ahead. 
 Get it confirmed from the White House. 
 She can't stay much longer. 
 Are you satisfied? 
CTU wants to know if that's enough to prove it. 
Have you confirmed this is live and the voices have been authenticated? 
Yes, sir. 
 So that's it. 
 Yes. 
When I land... I'll call you. 
Hm. 
You're bluffin'. 
You don't have Hewitt, do you? 
 Oh, yes, I do. 
 No, you don't. 
Scott, take her out. 
Kill her. 
Run, Sherry! 
Come on. Come on. 
Mrs Palmer, get out of here. Go! 
Jack Bauer. 
You've caused me a lot of trouble today, Jack. 
You're not gonna give me Hewitt, are you? 
Our bombers are three minutes from the targets. 
Initiating sequence six one tango one. 
Target in view. Weapons lock. 
Are we go for a strike? 
Are we go for a launch? 
We are awaiting command. 
Abort the attack. 
Abort, abort. 
What do you mean, Kingsley's dead? 
How could that happen? 
I warned you not to use him. 
So we did use him and he failed. 
But it won't matter. 
Once the war starts we'll be OK. 
 It isn't going to start. 
 Why's that? 
The president found out about the Cyprus recording and called off the attack. 
There isn't going to be any war, Max. 
Well... we're going to have 
to do this another way. 
 Another way? What are you talking about? 
 You'll find out. 
It'll start today. 
It's me. Go ahead. 
The cabinet has annulled its earlier action. 
I have instructed the Secret Service to resume its charge of serving you as President of the United States. 
I see. 
I've also tendered my resignation, effective immediately, and those members of the cabinet who voted against you have also agreed to resign. 
Jim. 
Gentlemen, ladies... 
we came dangerously close to war today. 
That all of us reacted emotionally to the nuclear detonation is understandable. 
But leaders are required to have patience beyond human limits. 
The kind of action we nearly took should only be exercised after all other avenues have been exhausted. 
After the strictest standard of proof has been met. 
By casting me aside so quickly, you effectively lowered those standards. 
And that was a profound mistake. 
It was not, however, a mistake you're likely to make again. 
Therefore I do not accept your resignations. 
We have a nation to heal today. 
And all of you play a vital role in that healing process. 
Mr President... 
I don't know what to say. 
There's nothing to say. 
We have work to do. 
That'll be all. 
 Jenny, set up a press conference. 
 When? 
As soon as you can. And I want it public. 
I want to speak to the people directly. 
They deserve my assurance. 
Yes, sir. 
Mike, I wanna thank you again for calling CTU in the 11th hour. 
Of course, Mr President. 
But you should have been with me to the end. 
That's what I expected of you. 
That's why I appointed you. 
I'm relieving you of your post, effective immediately. 
Yes, Mr President. 
Thank you, sir. 
I can't take all the credit myself. 
It's a great team George Mason put together here. 
Yes, I will. Thank you, sir. 
Tony. That was District Director Vaughn. 
He's so happy with what we did here today he doesn't know where to start. 
That's great. 
So... what's up, my friend? 
Well, um... 
it's like this. 
Either fire me... 
or get out of my chair. 
The chair's all yours. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
The new shift is here. 
They've been brought up to speed. 
I was thinking I'd get my brother and go home. 
Michelle, um... 
there's a handful of people who made a big difference today. 
You're one of'em. 
You made some tough choices and went up against me. You were right. 
Thanks. 
So, um... why don�t you 
go home and get some rest? 
Michelle. 
See you tomorrow. 
 I'll need to see the contents of your bag. 
 I'm Kate Warner and this is Kim Bauer. 
Excuse me. 
 Hey, honey. 
 Daddy. 
It's gonna be all right. 
I know. 
I love you. 
I love you too. 
Dad? I'm gonna take care of you. 
I urge you in the strongest terms not to indulge any rumours or theories that you may have heard, or may soon hear. 
Once the facts are known, I will present them to you myself. 
Until then, know that we are all safe and that we will continue to be safe. 
The most patriotic thing that we can all do today is to keep living our lives. 
So I urge you all, go back to work, go back to school. 
Because the freedom we enjoy, the freedom that we earn every day, is the very thing that will defeat our enemies and keep us strong. 
God bless America. 
God bless us all. Thank you. 
Thank you very much. God bless you. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
Thank you. Good to see you. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Mr President! 
Hi. 
Excuse me, Mr President. 
Thank you. 
Mr President. 
 Hi. 
 Thank you. 
 God bless you. 
 Thank you. 
 Yes. 
 It's done. 
Thank you. 
Mr President? 
The president's down! 
We need medical assistance. Help! 
Mr President? 
Mr President? It'll be all right, sir. 
We need an ambulance! Help! 
When? 
Today. 
Get me Eric Rayburn, NSA. 
I wish Nicole could have come. 
She loves it out here. 
Yeah. 
What do you wanna do tonight? 
I don't know. Get a movie? 
You came all this way to watch a video? 
How's your mom? 
Who knows? 
She puts on a happy face for everyone, but I know she's hurtin'. 
Yeah. 
OK. Copy that. 
 What is it, Rosser? 
 There's a situation, Mr President. 
OK, try and find me! 
Excuse me. What are you doing in my bed? 
Sh. I'm hiding from Daddy. 
What? 
 Oh, hi. 
 Hey, Kim. 
You haven't seen Megan around, have you? 
 What does she look like? 
 Big wart on the tip of her nose. 
 I do not! 
 There you are. 
Now I'm gonna get you. 
 Let me go! 
 I'm gonna get you now. 
I'm going to hide again. 
How do you keep up with her all day? 
It's not easy. 
Dad, I'm hiding! Try to find me! 
Here I come! 
Rayburn is waiting for us. 
I'll see you back at the retreat. 
Look, son... 
 I'm sorry. 
 Don't be. It's not your fault. 
 I just miss hanging out with you. 
 I know. 
We'll get there. 
 See you later. 
 All right. 
I know you wanna spend time with him. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
 How bad is the situation? 
 I don't know, but I don't have a good feeling. 
To my knowledge, no president's been rerouted by NSA on a morning off. 
Thank you. 
I didn't know how you liked intel presented at impromptus, if you like it chronologically with an alphabetical key, or if you just like separate folders with access tabs. 
 I don't really care. 
 I did it both ways, so you can choose. 
Thanks, Paula. George. 
 Hi, Mr Mason. 
 Yeah? 
I ordered upgrades on all the SIM software. 
I hope you don't mind. 
They just went to production and I thought you�d... 
Paula, stop. 
Right. OK. Thanks. 
What do you need? 
 Division want a meeting next month. 
 For what? 
They wanna see our proposal for the LAX security upgrades. 
Tony, if I'm still here this time next year, take me out to the woodshed and shoot me. 
I should be in DC, not chasing old ladies who set off metal detectors with knitting needles. 
The morning of the 15th? 
That's fine. 
 Mr Mason. 
 What? 
I just got off the phone with Eric Rayburn's office at NSA. 
They've a request, sir. 
They want you to take care of it right away. 
This can't be right. Eileen, get me Rayburn. 
I think he's up in Oregon with the president. 
Put it in my office. 
What was that about? 
NSA wants us to bring in Jack Bauer. 
What? What for? 
I don't know. That's all they said. 
Isn't Bauer inactive? 
Yeah, he's inactive. 
We'll have to reschedule our day. 
What do we have? 
National Wildlife benefit at one, a tour of the new Nike Campus, and your speech tonight. 
OK. Cancel what you have to, 
but I wanna give that speech, announce the new clean-energy proposal. 
 I'm not sure you'll have time for any of that. 
 Eric. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 Thanks, Jenny. 
 What's this about, Eric? 
 We have a domestic terrorist alert. 
 How serious? 
 Very. 
 Has Lynne been informed? 
 She's here. 
Who else? 
Representatives from all branches of the military, some FBI and the CIA. 
Mr President, I've called Mike Novick. 
He's getting on a plane right away. 
Good. Thank you. 
 Gentlemen. Lynne. 
 Morning, Mr President. 
What I'm about to tell you, Mr President, is triple-sourced. 
While crucial details are still unknown, we believe this intel to have high credibility. 
Go on. 
There's a nuclear device, under terrorist control, that's on US soil. 
My God! 
 Where? 
 Los Angeles. 
It gets worse. 
This bomb is going to go off today. 
How do we know this? 
This suicide bomber is Mamud Rashed Faheen, a suspected terrorist who we believe has been associated with fundamentalist groups. 
This is the Valentine's Day bombing in the West Bank? 
This particular attack resulted in 13 fatalities, 26 injured. 
We discovered that the secondary purpose of this incident was to create the impression Faheen was killed. 
 He wasn't? 
 No. 
This was taken five days ago at a small airport outside L�on, France. 
We had the man on the left, Jason Park, under surveillance. 
It was just a coincidence that we caught the very much alive Faheen in the photo. 
We grabbed Park and tried to extract everything we could out of him. 
15 minutes ago he broke and confessed that for the last two years Faheen has been preparing for today's attack on Los Angeles. 
Why didn�t you pick up Faheen? 
This picture wasn't analyzed until after the two had separated. 
I've contacted Defense, CIA, FBI and local jurisdictions. 
 Everything will be run through NSA. 
 Who controls Faheen? 
Relatively new splinter group that goes by the name of Second Wave. 
Government affiliation? 
Officially not recognised by any Middle Eastern state. 
Unofficially? 
 Get me their prime minister. 
 Right away. 
Gary, your breakfast is ready. 
Don't let it get cold. 
I'll be right there. 
I won't be back till this afternoon. I'm 
expecting a package. Keep an eye out for it? 
Sure. 
 Mom, I'm going skateboarding. 
 And what does that mean? 
I know - I have to put on my helmet and my elbow and knee pads. 
And stay close to Kim. 
 Love you. 
 What about Kim? 
She's the best nanny ever. 
 You off? 
 Yeah. 
Coffee's ready, I cut your grapefruit and I bought some scones. 
 Blueberry? 
 Of course. 
 You look good today. 
 Thanks. 
 I'll see you tonight, OK? 
 OK. 
You know, Kim, you've got a great body. 
You work out? 
Not really. I like to swim. 
Yes. 
I have the prime minister on the phone for you. 
 Mr Prime Minister. 
 Mr President. 
I was told you need to speak to me. 
What can you tell me about a terrorist organisation known as Second Wave? 
I've heard of them, but my government firmly rejects its tenets and its methods. 
In fact, we've recently arrested several of its members. 
How do you account for three Second Wave camps operating unimpeded in your country? 
There are no camps in my country. 
Mr Prime Minister, I know two things. 
One: Second Wave is planning an attack against one of my cities today. 
Two: your government supports Second Wave. 
I would appreciate it if you would stop using my people and my country as a source for every threat levelled at the United States. 
What I'm saying is not meant to be a threat, simply a statement of fact. 
If a bomb goes off on US soil today, I will have no choice but to retaliate, with immediate and decisive force, against your government. 
This is an insult. 
We are not planning to attack the United States. 
Insult or not, if you care about the lives of your citizens, you need to hear me loud and clear. 
Mr Prime Minister, if a bomb goes off today, it will hurt us, but it will destroy you. 
Then, Mr President, you will have created an enemy of over one third of the world's population. 
Proceed carefully. 
You as well, sir. 
 You wanna try it again? 
 Yeah. 
Don't fall. You can do it, though. 
All right. Slow... 
 Yeah. 
 Mr Bauer? 
 Who is this? 
 I have George Mason from CTU on the line. 
 I don't work for CTU any more. 
 He said that... 
I'm in the middle of something right now. 
Thank you. 
I'm so proud of you. You did so good. 
 Is there any blood? 
 Let me see. 
No, no blood. You're perfect. 
OK. I wanna go again. 
 All right. Let's go, tough guy. 
 Hey! I'm not a guy. 
You know what? Why don�t you go play 
in the back yard. I'll meet you there. 
See you in a bit. 
Hey, sweetheart. 
 Dad, what are you doing here? 
 I just wanted to say hi. 
You haven't been returning my calls. 
I'm sorry. 
I didn't come to ask you for lunch or hang out. 
I know you just started this job, but I just wanted to see you. I miss you. 
I know. I miss you too. 
 Then why won�t you... 
 Every time I see you, I think of Mom. 
 No, honey, please... 
 Yes, I do. 
If you wanna know, I'm telling you, it's too hard for me right now. 
All I ever wanted was the three of us to be together. 
 It wasn�t your fault. It just happened. 
 Of course it was my fault. 
Dad. 
I'm so sorry, honey. I'm so sorry. 
I love you. 
I'm just... still not ready yet. 
 Then when? 
 I don't know. 
Hey, Kim. Come on. 
 I gotta go. 
 Yeah. 
 Come in, Eric. 
 Mr President, you wanted to see me. 
Yes. This report seems to be 
missing a casualty assessment. 
I'm having those figures compiled right now. 
They'll be ready in about 10 minutes. 
 Thank you, Eric. 
 Mr President, if I may... 
I think you need to have a serious conversation with the Pentagon. 
They need to know how to proceed. 
It's too early to discuss a response. 
We don't even know who to retaliate against. 
 You know the prime minister was lying. 
 He was lying about the terrorist camps. 
But that doesn't mean his government is responsible for this threat. 
 Mr President, I think... 
 Eric, enough. 
Right now, my only concern is protecting Americans. 
Somewhere in Los Angeles, there is a terrorist with his finger on the trigger. 
We've got to get him. 
 Good morning. 
 Hi, sweetheart. 
Hey, you two! Cut it out. 
What? I can't kiss my own wife? 
She's not your wife for at least another 10 hours. 
 Andre is on the phone. 
 Is there a problem with the flowers? 
 I don't know. 
 God! 
Whoa. 
 Sorry. 
 So where are the tables? 
They're not even here yet. I don't know how 
they're gonna get everything set up in time. 
I thought you were picking your cousin up. 
 I sent a car. 
 Cab? 
No, the company car. 
Hey, Bob. How you doin'? 
 There's the groom. 
 Let me get that for you. 
I'm fine. 
I told Marie I'd help her fix the fountain. 
Best get to it. Luis. 
Dad, did you tell Reza he could use the company car to pick up his cousin? 
Kate, honey, please. Not today. 
If it were every now and then, fine, but there's the condo in Palm Springs, the days off... 
Why is it you can't trust Reza? I can't believe 
it's because he's from the Middle East... 
Dad, please. 
You brought me up better than that. 
I don't know. It's... something else. 
What? 
I don't know. Maybe I'm just having 
a hard time letting go of my little sister. 
I do miss your mother so much today. 
She'd be so proud of both of you. 
 Rayburn. 
 Eric, it's George again. 
 What have you got? 
 Not a lot. Haven't reached Bauer. 
 What's this about? 
 Your office will be briefed. 
Just find him and bring him in. 
We're doing everything we can. 
I don't think he wants to be found. 
In his condition, I don't think he'll be worth a damn anyway. 
I'm not asking for your opinion. 
I need this guy now. 
I refuse to believe that given your resources you can't bring in one former agent. 
I'll tell you how you can get hold of Bauer, but you�re not gonna like it. 
 I'm listening. 
 You're with the president right now, correct? 
Yeah, I am. 
This is Jack Bauer. 
Leave your message after the beep. 
Hi, Jack. It's Tony Almeida at CTU. 
I've left messages for you everywhere. 
Could you please give us a call? 
It's very important. 
This is Jack Bauer. 
Leave your message after the beep. 
Hello, Mr Bauer. 
I'm calling on behalf of President Palmer. 
The president needs to speak to you on an urgent matter. Please call us back... 
 Hello? 
 Mr Bauer? Please hold for the president. 
Sir, I have Jack Bauer. 
 Jack? 
 Mr President. 
You've been avoiding CTU's calls this morning. 
 I don't work for them any more, sir. 
 So I hear. 
How's it all going, Jack? 
 It's been difficult, sir. 
 I'm sure it has. 
 I've thought a lot about you this past year. 
 Thank you, Mr President. 
I know this is a bad time, but I need your help. 
I've been inactive for over a year. 
I can't see how I'd be of any help to anyone. 
We are in a grave situation that requires the attention of all branches of our national security. 
My advisors are convinced that you can play an important part in this effort. 
 I'm sorry, but I'm in no condition... 
 Jack, listen to me. 
I know you suffered a loss, I know it's hard, but this is not a routine request. 
Go to CTU, listen to what's happening, and then make your decision. 
Jack... 
You saved my life. 
I trust you as much as I trust anyone, and now I need your help. 
When do they need me? 
Now. 
Carla, why'd you come back? 
I was supposed to wrap a gift for Gary to take to his assistant today. 
 I can do it. 
 No. I have to do it. 
Why? 
Because Gary likes these things done in a very specific way. 
It would take too long to explain it. 
OK. 
Kim... 
I'm sorry. 
Will you take Megan upstairs to play? 
Sure. 
Have you looked at your system? 
No. What's up? 
Langley issued an information flow advisory. 
Whatever's going on will be inter-agency. 
All right. Call Lindauer and Grothy and 
tell them they don't have a day off after all. 
And... start filtering anything that comes in. 
Hey. 
 Something's going on, isn't it? 
 We're not sure. 
 I could do those redundancies. 
 It's OK. 
 I've studied the protocols. 
 Paula, you're trying too hard. 
Just do your job. Everything's gonna be fine. 
Sorry. I waited to get assigned here 
for two years. I just... 
Heads up. I need all department heads 
over here right now. 
We've an active priority. 
I just got off a conference call with NSA and Division. 
It appears there's a nuclear bomb, under terrorist control, somewhere here in Los Angeles, set to go off at some point in the course of the day, so... 
From this moment on, we do not communicate with anybody outside of our secured envelope. 
That means we don't call home, we don't talk to friends, we don't call relatives. 
Our job is to find this device and stop it. 
We do not want to create panic. 
I know this isn't very pleasant, but this is our job, this is what we do. 
So let's do it. 
George. 
 I still haven't been able to reach Jack. 
 NSA got hold of him. 
Is this why they wanted him? I mean, 
he's been out of play for over a year. 
I'm guessing it has something to do with one of his previous covers. 
In this scenario, immediate loss of life would be in the low thousands, relatively small. 
But the dispersal of radioactive debris from a dirty bomb is unpredictable and could multiply that figure many times over. 
I understand that we don't know whether this is a dirty bomb or something bigger. 
Give me the worst-case scenario. 
All right. Worst-case scenario. 
Stolen Soviet nuclear warhead, a properly configured trigger detonated 500 feet above the city. 
Approximately 100 square miles would be irradiated within seconds. 
Apart from the loss of life, this kind of blow would have global repercussions that would last for years. 
Thank you, Eric. 
What would you like to do about the Joint Chiefs, sir? They're waiting to hear from you. 
I'm not ready to speak to them yet. 
Mr President, if I could suggest that you at least start the dialogue. 
At this point, this is not a military operation. 
It is a potential terrorist attack, and that's the way I'm going to approach it. 
Yes, sir. 
Thank you, everybody. 
Paula, I need you to open up another socket for me. 
And Mason wants to see you in the conference room. 
Paula? 
 I don't know if I can do this. 
 Of course you can do it. 
No, I'm just a programmer and I don't think I work very well under this kind of pressure, so maybe they just wanna bring somebody else in. 
Look, Paula, there is no one else. 
You're the best at what you do. You know 
the system inside out. That's why you're here. 
Just take it one task at a time. 
Right now all I need you to do is open up a couple of sockets. 
And then get to the conference room, all right? 
OK? 
OK. 
Thank you. 
Hey, Jack. 
 Hi, Tony. How you doing? 
 Fine. How you been? 
I've been all right. Where's George? 
He's waiting for you in the conference room. 
 You've been briefed? 
 Yeah. 
Jack. 
 Jack Bauer, Michelle Dessler... 
 What am I doing here, George? 
There's a rogue nuclear weapon here in Los Angeles, Jack. 
Intel says it's going off today. 
 How good's your intel? 
 Very. 
NSA have high-probability leads on regional cells that might be involved. 
How close are you to IDing a prime suspect? 
Not close at all. 
That's what you�re here for. 
Where are you going, Jack? Jack? 
George, let me talk to him. 
Jack. 
Just give me a second, Tony. 
Hello? 
 It's me. Listen. This is really important. 
 Dad, I told you today, I'm not ready. 
 Kim, this is not about us. 
 What's it about? 
I'm at CTU. They gave me some information. 
You and I have to leave Los Angeles together now. 
No, Dad. If you're going back to work, fine, 
but you�re not dragging me into it. 
I'm not trying to get back to work. 
Kim, don't hang up on me. 
Hi, this is Kim. Leave a message. 
Honey, it's me. 
If you don't wanna leave with me, fine, but you�ve got to get out of Los Angeles. 
It's not safe for you here. Don't talk 
to anybody. Just go to Aunt Carol's. 
I'm gonna call her now and tell her that you�re coming. When you get there, phone me. 
Sweetheart, please, just do this for me. Please. 
 Jack, wait a minute. 
 I don't have time. 
You were called in because it's a background match. 
You're the only one that can run with this. 
 I don't care. 
 It's not like before. 
We can get to Kim, get her out of the city, keep her safe. I promise you. 
The best thing you can do now is help us find that bomb. 
I trusted everybody here at CTU to protect my wife and I lost her. 
Tony, I'm not gonna lose my daughter. I'm sorry. 
I know, Jack. I was there. 
Tony, look, I know you did everything you could. I do. 
I just can't lose my daughter. 
I'm sorry. 
Carol, it's Jack. I wanted Kim 
to get out of the city and come visit you. 
I'll explain as soon as I talk to you. 
Could you do me a huge favour? 
As soon as she gets there, call me and let me know she's safe. Thank you. 
Great, Almeida. Now what? 
 Back off, George. I did the best I could. 
 I guess your best isn't very good, then. 
Maybe there's another way to find Wald. 
Why didn't I think of that? I bet NSA had us 
bring in a burnt-out agent for the challenge. 
 Anyone could have done the job. 
 Settle down, George, all right? 
Let's sit down, regroup and figure out what we're gonna do. 
What we're gonna do? 
We're gonna call NSA. Now. 
Here's the deal. I want Knoll or Grothy 
to pick up my daughter and take her a safe distance outside of this city. 
Done. 
I wanna be kept up to date on their status by Tony. 
 Sorry, George. I don't trust you. 
 You're gonna have to start. 
What we're up against today none of us can walk away from. 
Tony and I'll both take care of Kim. 
I'll do it now. 
Thank you. 
Tell me about the regional cells. 
The most promising one's headed by Joseph Wald. 
Joseph Wald? 
Wald's been linked to a terror group called Second Wave. 
That's why it had to be you. 
You put in time undercover with him. 
 I put him in jail, George. 
 He's out on appeal. 
And he's actually awaiting trial right now on new charges. 
 If he's convicted, he goes away for life. 
 What's Wald's connection? 
NSA established meetings between him and the group behind the threat. 
 Why didn�t you pick Wald up? 
 We haven't tracked him down yet. 
He's not at any of the addresses in his file. 
Are there are key witnesses against Wald in his upcoming trial? 
 There's one. 
 Marshall Goren. 
 Apparently without him there's no case. 
 Good. Bring him in. 
Here? What for? 
You want me to re-establish my cover with Wald. It takes at least six weeks. 
You want me to do this in under two hours. 
Where's the FBI holding Goren? 
Downtown, right here in protective custody. 
Good. Bring him in. Now. 
 Scott's coming to the wedding? 
 Yeah. He called. 
I thought you knew he wouldn't come. 
I dated him six years ago, honey. 
He's more like a brother to me. 
Is the groom jealous? 
Jealous? It's not a question of jealousy. 
It's a question of what I'm comfortable with. 
My brothers married women that had never been with another man. 
That's what my family expects of us all. 
Oh. 
I see. So, instead, they have to settle 
for Marie, who's what - damaged goods? 
All right, don't let him bait you. 
He's just trying to push our buttons. 
I've got this guy wrapped around my little finger and he knows it. 
Kate. Tel�fono. 
I'll show you the seating chart. 
Thanks. 
 Hello? 
 This is Ralph Burton. Is this a bad time? 
No, Ralph. Can you hold on a second? 
Sorry, Ralph. What's up? 
Didn�t you get my cheque? 
Yes. That's not why I'm calling. 
When you asked for a background on Reza Naiyeer, you were worried about his financial integrity. 
The report you showed me said I had nothing to worry about. Has something changed? 
Not exactly. He's done nothing wrong 
at your father's company, and his financial dealings in the past have been legitimate. 
Great. So what's the problem? 
I was proofing a file on another individual. 
 Reza's name came up. 
 Yeah, so? 
There's a man named Syed Ali. 
He's an international financier with ties to several terrorist organisations. 
What are you saying? 
Reza knows this guy Ali? 
Well, according to this file, they've had dealings. 
Oh, my God. 
It's possible that Reza's business with Ali was legitimate, that Reza didn't even know about Ali's terrorist connection. 
But if you wanna know for sure, I'm gonna need your help. 
What do you need me to do? 
Let's not waste time. I don't want 
my decisions based on speculation. 
Before I read any of the reports, I want the sources and their reliability double-checked. 
Excuse me. 
Did you set up a comm with the Joint Chiefs regarding response? 
No. 
The secretary of state called. They're 
expecting to speak with you in five minutes. 
What? 
 Cancel it. 
 Yes, sir. 
Eric. 
Yes, Mr President. 
Would you excuse us, please? 
I thought I was clear that we're not to burn time and energy on response. 
Of course, sir. 
Then why is there a conference call set up with the Joint Chiefs? 
In case you changed your mind. 
It takes time to coordinate. 
Don't second-guess me, Eric. 
Today's gonna be a very long day, and I don't want my own people working against me. 
Sir, I would never work against you. 
Goren's gonna be here any minute. 
He'll be back in your custody within the hour. 
All right, George. 
Our pals at the FBI aren't too happy. 
Goren's the state's only witness against Wald. 
Get what you want fast cos I want them off my back. 
What's that? 
We're saying you were extradited to Florida on two counts of armed robbery. 
Don't make it armed robbery  that's not how they knew me. 
Conspiracy to transport illegal explosives. 
Got it. 
Are you gonna let me in our your plan? 
And get in touch with a Rudi Collett, a parole officer. 
 Brief him and then put him into my cover. 
 Jack. 
Look at you. You look like a bum 
off the street, you're not talking to me. 
I just confiscated a witness outside of my authority based on your call. 
 Are you gonna tell me what you�re doing? 
 No. 
Are you losing it? I don't have the time or 
the resources to clean up your messes today. 
I'm not losing it. 
Just put him in the chair. 
Thank you, gentlemen. 
Michelle, please excuse us. 
 Don�t you want me to...? 
 No. 
 You are Marshall Goren? 
 Yeah. 
Eight counts: kidnapping a minor. 
Two counts: child pornography. 
First degree murder. 
Yeah. Hey, look. I already made my deal. 
I don't need to hear this noise. 
All I gotta do is testify against Wald, and I walk. 
Get a helicopter and a backup team ready to leave here in 15 minutes. 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 You wanna find this bomb? 
 This is what it's gonna take. 
 Killing a witness? 
People like you want results but you never wanna get your hands dirty. 
I'd start rolling up your sleeves. 
I'm gonna need a hacksaw. 
Look, Kim. Olivia's giving Kristen a haircut. 
 Olivia gave Kristen a haircut last night. 
 Her hair grows really fast. 
Are you a complete idiot? 
I had to leave in the middle of a meeting! 
How do you think that makes me look? 
You cannot possibly be this incompetent. 
Can we go somewhere else? 
I don't like it when he gets like this. 
What do you mean? What does he do? 
Stay there. 
It's gonna be fine. 
Megan. 
Sweetie. 
Megan, are you in there? 
Open the door, sweetie. Now. 
Go in the bathroom. 
 Just a minute. We're in the bathroom. 
 You're what? 
Be right there. 
Sorry. Megan's going through 
a modest stage. No boys allowed. 
 So you guys were in the bathroom? 
 Yeah. 
 You didn't hear anything? 
 What do you mean? 
 Carla had a little accident. She slipped. 
 Is she OK? 
Yeah, she's fine. Just fine. 
 Why don�t you go give her a hand? 
 Well... 
Listen, I need a few minutes with my daughter before I leave, OK? 
 What's the matter, petal? 
 We were... 
 Did I not tell you to get outta here? 
 Mommy! 
 It's OK, Megan. 
 Honey, I'm sorry. 
Daddy's had a bad... I'm sorry. 
Just be quiet. Megan, shut up. 
 Megan, shut up! 
 Leave her alone! 
Stay down, Kim. I will hurt you! 
Shut up, Megan! 
What? Yeah. 
Yes, I said I'd be back in a couple of minutes. 
Yeah. 
Listen, I just have to take care of something. 
I'll be a few minutes.
