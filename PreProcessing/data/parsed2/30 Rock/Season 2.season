Hey. 
How was your summer? 
Hey, Gary. 
How was your summer? 
Hey. 
How was your summer? 
Hey, Jack! 
There's my buddy. 
Walk with me, Lemon. 
You look great. 
I can't believe I haven't spoken to you since your heart attack. 
That's what I wanted to talk to you about. 
Nobody from corporate knows about my cardiac event, and I want to leave it that way. 
I'm back, Lemon. 
I've had the most productive summer of my life. 
Me too. 
All of my summer replacement shows were big hits. 
"America's Next Top Pirate." 
"Are You Stronger Than a Dog?" 
"MILF Island." 
"MILF Island"? 
"25 superhot moms. 
50 eighth-grade boys. 
No rules." 
Oh, yeah, didn't one of those women turn out to be a prostitute? 
That doesn't mean she's not a wonderful, caring MILF. 
Well, I had a great summer, too. 
And, um... 
Did you redecorate, or... 
Sir, I have all the latest "Seinfeld-Vision" promos. 
Oh, wonderful. 
What's "Seinfeld-Vision"? 
Well, I realized that NBC owns hundreds of hours of footage of Seinfeld from his massively successful television series, "Seinfeld." 
So my old tech guys were able to digitally capture Seinfeld, and now we can basically make him do or say whatever we want. 
So for the month of October, all of our prime-time shows will feature a computerized guest appearance from Mr. Jerry... 
Seinfeld. 
If you didn't kill her, why didn't you stay? 
Quit grilling me! 
"Seinfeld-Vision"? 
Save the cheerleader, save the world. 
Yeah! 
That's what I said! 
"Seinfeld-Vision"? 
Deal or no deal? 
I'll take that deal! 
Does Jerry Seinfeld know you're doing this? 
Jerry's in Europe with his family right now. 
But by the time he gets back, "Seinfeld-Vision" will be a monster hit. 
His kids will go to school, and their friends will say, "I really loved your dad on that episode of 'Medium' last night." 
And he's... 
he's gonna love it. 
Uh-huh. 
Well, I had a great summer, too. 
I started a quilt. 
I did yoga twice a week. 
I wore flip-flops in public. 
I really feel like this is gonna be my year. 
"Biggest Loser." 
So, uh, what's up with Floyd? 
Uh, we broke up. 
We agreed that it was crazy to try it long-distance. 
And I feel great about it. 
Oh, come on. 
Lemon, if there's two things I'm certain of, one is you will never finish that quilt... 
I know. 
...and you are not 
over Floyd. 
No, I really am, Jack. 
I'm telling you, this is my year. 
I feel like the show's gonna be great. 
And I'm very positive that I'm gonna meet someone else. 
Lemon, women your age are more likely to be mauled at the zoo than get married. 
Good to see you. 
Bye. 
Glad we're both doing so great. 
Put Floyd's name on that quilt. 
Yo, Ken, I'm gonna use this whole kitchen area as my bathroom. 
Spread the word. 
What is this? 
Mr. Jordan's wife 
kicked him out. 
She froze my credit cards, Liz Lemon. 
And she got custody of Grizz. 
Can I keep my cockatiel in your office? 
No. Go home and apologize 
to your wife. 
What? 
I'm not apologizing. 
'Cause for once in my life, I haven't done anything wrong. 
How many years have you known me, Liz Lemon? 
One. 
So you know I like to minister to transvestite prostitutes. 
I don't think I did know that, no. 
It's true. 
He doesn't mess with them. 
He just tries to get them into computer school. 
So Labor Day weekend, I see this young she-dude at the Dumpster by the 40/40. 
I pull over and I say, "You don't have to live your life like this. 
You can be a freaky-deaky and do data entry." 
Sure. 
"What about court reporting? 
Believe in yourself!" 
Right. 
So as I reach in the trash and pull this dude out, a paparazzo jumps out and takes a picture of me. 
"Tracy Jordan and his wife, Angie." 
Oops. 
So not only are you holding a transvestite prostitute... 
They confused shim with Mrs. Jordan... Yes, ma'am. 
And they think she looks better here than she did at the 2004 Grammys. 
Who's gonna do my banking? 
Who's gonna write my blogs? 
Who's gonna do the cooking on taco Wednesdays? 
Okay, Kenneth, you are now in charge of helping Tracy with any of the nonsexual things that Angie would do for him. 
So he's, like, my office wife? 
Sure. 
Let's go with that. 
Kenneth Parcell, would you take this ring... 
and sell it in the Jewish part of Midtown and use the money to get us a Nintendo Wii? 
Yes. Yes! 
A thousand times, yes! 
Liz, how was your summer? 
Good. 
Floyd and I... 
'Cause my play was amazing. 
There is nothing like the thrill of doing a live show on Broadway. 
You know, Jojo... 
When life keeps handing you anchovies? 
Just cover them up with some extra cheese? 
And make a pizza? 
I'm sorry I missed it. 
It sounds just like the movie. 
What happened to you? 
Do I look fat? 
Liz, I had to eat four slices of pizza onstage at each performance. 
Jenna, that's 32 pieces of pizza a week! 
No. 
That can't be right. 
Liz, it's like I flipped the eating switch, and I can't flip it back. 
You have to help me. 
Well, how am I su... 
Oh, it's worse from behind. 
I'm on it. 
She needs to lose 30 pounds or gain 60. 
Anything in between has no place on television. 
I can't believe I missed you. 
Did Jack say anything about my weight? 
No, he didn't even mention it. 
He's not noticing. 
No one is noticing. 
Oh! Whoa! 
Oh, damn! Yowza! 
Hey, Mr. Michelin, 
I love your tires. 
Okay, everyone. 
Welcome back. 
Some of you may be wondering what happened between me and my boyfriend, Floyd, this summer. 
The answer is, we did break up, but I am doing fine. 
Was Floyd the black guy? 
Okay. 
You don't care. 
I don't care, either. 
So, great. 
I want a packet of 50 ideas from each of you by tomorrow morning. 
What? 
Come on! Oh, boo! 
Hey, I need to ask you guys something. 
Move away from me. 
Don't stand near me. 
Will you guys be bridesmaids in my wedding? 
Oh, that is very sweet. 
But I think I might be past bridesmaid age. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
Is it hard for you because you just broke up with that Floyd guy? 
No! What? No. 
That's... 
You know, I would love... 
We would love to be your bridesmaids. 
Great. We need to go 
dress shopping tomorrow, then. 
So meet me at Les Fesses at 10:00 a.m. 
Yay! 
Yay! 
Ohh. 
Now I have my "something old." 
Rise and shine, Mr. Jordan. 
I couldn't sleep at all last night. 
Angie kept my Sharper lmage white-noise aromatherapy machine. 
She knows I can't sleep without the sound of the ocean and the smell of bacon. 
Well, hurry up and get your second wind, 'cause I've got our day all planned out. 
We'll start at Bed Bath & Beyond and get all the things that you're gonna need in here. 
Then an old friend of mine from college is having her baby shower out on Long Island, so we'll swing by there. 
And for dinner, I thought we could just stay in and have the rest of that soup that I made yesterday. 
I'm not doing any of that. 
Okay. Fine. 
I went with you to your black vampire movie, but I guess I'll just tell my friends that you have a migraine. 
Great compromise, office wife. 
Okay. 
Hey, you know where I could find that Jack Donaghy? 
I got a bone to pick with that guy. 
I don't know which bone I'm gonna pick. 
But he's got some bones, and I'm gonna pick one. 
Really? 
Weddings are so weird. 
This veil costs more than my couch. 
Is that comedy, or do you really have a $300 couch? 
Both. 
What, you never pretended to be a bride when you were a little girl? 
I did. 
I just never romanticized it. 
This is my husband, Sol Rosenbear. 
And this is his son, Richard, from a previous marriage. 
And then he cheated on me with a lamb. 
Oh. 
Liz, this dress is amazing. 
They don't have it in my size. 
Can you try it on for me so I can see how it hangs? 
Yes. You're closer, Liz. 
You do it. 
I mean, I could do it, but... 
Fun. 
This is fun. 
Sir, Jerry Seinfeld is here to see you. 
You told me he was in Europe. 
Does he look upset? 
He looks the way you did when I tried to hold your hand on the jet. 
Stall him a few minutes, Jonathan, till I get my ducks in a row. 
And get Legal on the phone. 
Oh, my God. 
If I cover my good eye, you look just like Courteney Cox. 
This one is really nice, Cerie. 
And it's 40% off. 
Oh, no. 
Aris would kill me if I ever bought a dress on sale. 
I can't. 
It really is nice, isn't it? 
You should buy it and save it for your wedding. 
No, no. 
I'm... I'm single. 
Doing great. 
But don't you think you will ever get married to anyone? 
You are trying to make a sale. 
I know how this works. 
Oh, thank you. 
Hi. Jack? 
No, of course I'm at the office. 
Yeah. 
Stall who? 
This is our control room. 
Uh-huh. 
There's nobody in there. 
Sorry there's nothing to see. 
We just got back from summer hiatus yesterday. 
Yeah. 
Everybody's summer good? 
Oh, mine was great! 
I read, like, two books. 
I broke up with my boyfriend. 
But I'm doing great. 
I'm totally over it. 
Mm-hmm. 
Still talking? 
Oh, no, no, no, no. 
I haven't talked to him since, whoa, I don't know. 
August 9th, 4:17 p. M? 
Mm-hmm. 
It's not over. 
Oh, no, it's over. 
I'm over it. 
No, it's not over till you pick up the phone, you say, "I don't love you anymore." 
They say, "I don't love you anymore, either." 
You go, "Great. 
I'll pick you up in 20. 
Let's grab a scone." 
A scone. Yes! 
I want that. 
I'm gonna call him. 
Liz Lemon! 
I need you to go to my house and pretend you're doing a survey for the Ranford Group. 
And then ask my wife if she's sleeping with D.L. Hughley. 
No, I'm not doing any of that. 
J.S.! 
Oh, Tracy. 
What's up? 
Liz Lemon, me and this dude used to do stand-up together. 
Remember that night we had the three-way with Elayne Boosler? 
I don't think that was me. 
Oh, yeah. 
You know what? 
I think that was a mirror. 
Ah. 
J.S., 
this is my Kenneth. 
Ah, yeah. You again. 
Hello. 
Jonathan, when is he gonna meet with Jerry? 
This is taking forever. 
Mr. Donaghy left. 
What? When?! 
Just a few minutes ago. 
Jack? 
Jack? 
Jack? 
Jerry? 
Is that you? 
Nobody told me you were here. 
Oh, I'm here, Jack. 
Kenneth, why didn't you tell me Mr. Seinfeld is here? 
What's wrong with him? 
Hello? 
Hello? I'm sorry. 
May I speak to Floyd, please? 
Oh, he's in the shower. 
Well, I am conducting a survey for the Ranford Group, and, uh... 
How old are you? 
And your weight? 
And when was the last time you had intercourse? 
Who is this? 
Who are you? 
I'm your worst nightmare is who I is! 
He's got some girl over there already! 
Wow. 
That is so embarrassing for you. 
So how can I help you, Jerry? 
Jack, I was vacationing with my family in Europe in a country only rich people know about. 
Svenborgia? 
No. 
Better. 
But I can't tell you. 
Anyway, my mother called to tell me that I'm gonna be on "Law & Order." 
And "ER." 
So I called my agent to find out... 
when did I shoot these things? 
That's the beauty of this, Jerry. 
It's all done with computers. 
When you see it, you're gonna love it. 
25 sexy moms, 50 sweaty eighth-grade boys, and one beloved American comedy star. 
This Wednesday on "MILF Island." 
Really? 
Is that really your pitch? 
Okay. I get it. 
This is a two-way street. 
All right, Jerry. 
What NBC shows do you want to be digitally inserted into? 
I like "Lost." 
Is that you guys? 
Jerry, don't be difficult. 
The fact of the matter is that "Seinfeld-Vision" is perfectly legal, and there's nothing you can do to stop us. 
I'm sorry, but... 
it's business. 
Here's some business... 
How 'bout I buy NBC and turn it into the biggest Lane Bryant in Midtown? 
Jerry, come on. 
You're gonna buy NBC? 
Like you've got $4 million just laying aroun... 
Jerry, I'm sorry. 
Give me two days, and I'll come up with something you'll really be proud of. 
Besides, you owe me. 
Remember? St. Barts? 
I saved your life from that shark? 
All right, Jack. 
I'll come back. 
But I still think you shot a dolphin! 
Hi, I'm here to drop off the inspiration photos. 
And you are the mother. 
Bridesmaid, yes. 
Th... That's my dress. 
Don't buy that. 
That looks ugly on you. 
Yeah, you'll thank me. 
Is that dress still on sale? 
Yes. 
You know, a lot of women buy their perfect dress when they see it and then just trust the fact that the husband will come. 
Yeah. 
Well, this is my year. 
I mean, Floyd's moving on. 
I'm moving on, too. 
I'm just doing it in my own order. 
I'm gonna get the wedding dress, and then I'm gonna have a baby, and then I'm gonna die, and then I'm gonna meet a supercute guy in heaven. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, I'm not kidding, blondie. 
Get out of the dress. 
I'm gonna need to spread it over a couple different credit cards. 
Lemon, I am in full-blown crisis mode. 
I've already sold $20 million worth of ad time for "Seinfeld-Vision," and now Jerry wants to pull the plug. 
But I don't care, because I thrive in crisis mode. 
It's when I'm really at my best. 
And the fact that I do not have one idea how to solve this only energizes me more. 
I've been brainstorming all night. Here we go. 
Number one... 
Kill Seinfeld. 
Number two... Kill Seinfeld, 
then kill myself. 
Number three... 
Kill Seinfeld, flee to Svenborgia, then kill myself. 
Jack, I'm not having the best day either. 
Number 70... 
You seduce Seinfeld. 
Now, why is me seducing Seinfeld all the way at 70? 
Number 71... 
I fake a hurricane and all regularly scheduled programming is preempted. 
These are terrible ideas. 
There are no bad ideas in brainstorming, Lemon. 
I'm sure I'll come up with something at the eleventh hour. 
I always do. 
'Cause I'm just that good. 
Mmm. 
It was on sale. 
Oh. 
I'm mad at you, Ken. 
I seen the way you was looking at Seinfeld. 
You used to look at me like that. 
What, am I not a big enough star for you anymore? 
I am not even gonna dignify that with an answer. 
Especially after I picked out all these throw pillows for in here, and you didn't even notice! 
Hey, everyone. 
I know what you're thinking. 
How did I lose 25 pounds in one day? 
I didn't. 
It's visual trickery. 
Drawing the eye up. 
Hey, Liz, you got to see this. 
Jenna looks bananas... 
Nope. 
The real crazy is in here. 
Liz lost it. 
It was on sale. 
I thought you and Floyd broke up. 
We did. 
And I am doing great with it. 
I just bought a dress. 
Because, you know, I don't need society's permission to buy a white dress. 
Who says this is a wedding dress anyway? 
In Korea they wear white to funerals. 
All right, uh, I'm in charge now. 
Everyone go home. 
No. 
I'm not crazy, Frank. 
I am making a statement... 
that, if need be, I will marry myself. 
And I am not embarrassed that you guys are seeing me wearing this. 
So you're intending to wear that all day? 
Yeah, Chocolate Rain, maybe I am. 
Liz, um, Seinfeld's here and Jack's not ready for him, so you need to give him another tour. 
Wonderful. 
Hello, Jerry. 
Well, well, well. 
So you called that boyfriend. 
Yes, I did. 
And it went well? 
No. 
It didn't, Jer. 
A woman answered. 
Another woman already? 
What did you say to her? 
I did a fake survey. 
You did the fake survey?! 
I know! 
I'm not over it! 
And now I'm wearing this! 
What is the deal with my life?! 
Are you imitating me? 
No! 
This is what I sound like when I cry! 
I think I'm a little insulted. 
You're insulted? 
I'm crying! 
I got nothing. 
Mr. Seinfeld's here. 
I got nothing. 
Oh, Jerry, wonderful. 
Please, come in. Come in. 
Can get you some water? 
No, thank you. 
Would you like some tea? 
Some coffee? 
Some iced coffee? 
We have iced tea. 
We have some juice. 
All right. 
Give me a water if that just moves it along. 
Okay. Boy, have I got 
a presentation for you. 
This presentation is going to, uh, knock your socks off. 
Here, let me close this window so we don't have any glare on the monitor. 
How was your weekend? 
It's Thursday. 
Well, I mean last weekend. 
It was very nice. 
Can we just move this presentation along, please? 
It's "Seinfeld-Vision"... 
and giving America the programs they like with the star that they love for one incredible month of television. 
What the hell are you doing?! 
God! 
Oh, God, Jerry! 
God, Jerry! 
I got nothing! 
I got nothing! 
You've got to do this for me, please! 
Oh, God, I've already sold the ad time. 
What is wrong with you people? 
What's happened to this network? 
Call off your goons! 
All right, Kenneth. 
All right, listen, Seinfeld. 
I'll give you $1 million and five free commercials for your animated feature, "Bee Movie." 
And you let me run this for one week. 
$2 million to the charity of my choice, 10 free commercials for "Bee Movie"... 
opening November 2nd... 
and I do nothing. 
You let me run "Seinfeld-Vision" for three nights, I give you $1.5 million 
for the charity of your choice, unlimited free promotions on the "Today" show, and you give me the name of that country you went to. 
One night. 
Doctors Without Borders. 
Roker in a bee costume. 
Grenyarnia. 
Oh, God. 
Oh, no! 
Did a Korean person die? 
No, Tracy. 
It's a wedding dress. 
Don't do it, Liz Lemon. 
I know what me and Kenneth have looks perfect on the outside. 
But it's work, damn it. 
It's work. 
How'd it go with Seinfeld? 
I think I pulled it off. 
Good God, Lemon. 
What's happened to you? 
I thought this was going to be your year. 
I couldn't even hold it together one week. 
I'm not you, Jack. 
I can't have a heart attack and pretend like it never happened. 
I can't break up with someone and immediately recover. 
I'm not you. 
I'm just me. 
Lemon, don't ever say you're just you. 
Because you are better than you. 
And I am not going to let you give up. 
This is going to be our year. 
Now give me the ham. 
I like the ham. 
Come on. 
$4,000 ham napkin. 
I look pretty, though, right? 
Don't push it, Lemon. 
When life keeps handing you anchovies? 
Just cover them up with some extra cheese? 
And make a pizza with what you've got? 
Life is a pizza with everything on top? 
Pizza? 
With what you've got? 
Life is a pizza with everything on top? 
Pizza? 
What you've got? 
Pizza with everything on top? 
are you makin' waffles? 
No,quiet. 
Somebody is,and the maple syrup smells delicious. 
jack russell terrier? 
no,I can't get a dog. 
 you should. 
A dog'll change your life. 
Hey,I just wanted to make sure you're practicing your rerun dance for the what's happening sketch. 
I'm trying,liz lemon,but I can't concentrate. 
Somebody on my block is making waffles,and it's makin' me horny! 
Wait,you smell maple syrup too? 
You live all the way in jersey. 
That's weird. 
Hold on. 
Hello? 
Do you smell maple syrup? 
 Yes! 
Don't panic,lemon. It's 
probably not a chemical attack. 
What do you mean "probably"? 
It's probably just a strange wind pattern coming off those factories in staten island, where food flavors are made. 
I don't think it's northrax. 
What's northrax? 
It's a chemical agent we sold to the saudis in the 1980s. 
It smells exactly like maple syrup. 
But I don't think this is it. 
Well,how do you know? 
Because northrax kills you within ten seconds. 
Okay,I'll talk to you tomorrow. 
proudly presents 30 Rock Season02 Episode06 Make me look like this. 
Right,like that's a stretch. 
Hey,jack,thanks for that call last night. 
I get really nut burgers over this homeland security stuff. 
Always check with me first,lemon. 
I have nsa connections. 
 Good. 
Didn't you just get a haircut two days ago? 
I get my haircut every two days. 
After all,your hair is your head suit. 
I'm going to a party tonight honoring robert novak. 
It's being thrown by john mccain and john bauer. 
Um,I don't think he's real. 
Oh,I assure you,lemon,john mccain is very real. 
I have to look perfect. 
When it comes to hair,no one is more bitchy than conservative males. 
Good lord,donaghy. 
Did you comb your hair with a chicken bone? 
They can be brutal. 
Well,have fun. 
Don't get peer pressured into invading iran. 
Oh,uh,before you go,I'd like you to put this on. 
Sheinhardt wig company? What's this? 
A way to show support for our parent company, which is having a little p.R.Hiccup right now. 
NOT POISONING RIVERS SINCE 1997 All right. Thanks. 
Picked up your tuxedo from the cleaners,mr.Donaghy. 
Just like you asked. 
Thank you,kenneth. 
Let me just take this plastic off. 
'Cause I saw on martha stewart how we're all doing everything wrong. 
Where are the pants? 
Sweet peaches! 
What have I done? 
Somewhere along the way,they must have slipped out the bottom. 
It's all right,kenneth. 
These things happen. 
Uncle butch was right. 
I'm just a stupid country bumpkin with great skin and soft hands. 
I'll just have jonathan bring over another pair. 
No,sir. This is my mistake. 
I will replace your pants. 
They cost $2,500. 
I will find your pants! 
All right! My 
prescription shampoo! 
who is it? 
Hi,I have your mail. 
I live across the hall. 
H- hi,I didn't even realize anyone had moved in over here. 
Welcome. 
I'M...liz. What's your name? 
Raheem. 
Raheem. That's 
that's my mother's name. 
No,it- no,I'm just kidding. 
Give me my package,please. 
 okay. 
Well,it was nice to meet... 
coming up next,candace van der shark,a lifetime intimate portrait. 
Have you met the guy across the hall? 
Raheem? Yeah,he's a good egg. 
He's weird. He 
wouldn't shake my hand. 
And I think it's because i'm a woman. 
And get this-he's got maps all over his walls. 
Maps. 
 Maps? 
You mean like that one? 
That's different,that's that's an antique. 
And I'm a white lady. 
What are you saying there,liz? 
Pete,you know me. 
I never make assumptions about race. 
Remember,I asked that black guy if he had seen sideways? 
But this guy... 
I don't like him. 
You're being paranoid. 
Raheem is a really nice guy. 
And he's always helping. 
He rewired the toaster oven,and... 
he showed me a back way to the airport. 
Listen to yourself,pete. 
I don't want to sound racist,but that pita pocket might be a terrorist. 
That sound racist? 
this rich chestnut color is natural? 
Excuse me. 
Whiskey,straight up. 
I'll have a white rum with diet ginger ale and a splash of lime. 
Wow,I never would have pegged you for a university of tennessee sorority girl. 
Well,you've got to pace yourself with these things. 
We go all night. 
 That's good advice. 
Unfortunately,I promised bill frist the next slow dance. 
I'm C.C. 
 Jack. 
Nice haircut. 
Sir,here's your nancy drew. 
For men,it's called a hardy boy. 
Hey,kk,how's it hangin'? 
Very low,sir. Very low. 
I lost something real important. 
You know what I do when I lose something? 
I yell real loud until I find it. 
So what is it that you lost? 
 Pants. 
Pants!Pants!Pants!Pants!Pants!Pants! 
How 'bout the sean johns? 
Were you chafing again,tray? 
I don't think that's gonna help me find mr.Donaghy's pants. 
Well,did you retrace your steps? 
Or go back to the drycleaners? 
Yes,obvious twins. 
And I tried looking in the last place you'd ever expect. 
And,no,mr.Donaghy's pants are not in the ladies' 
room at that laser tag place on 12th avenue. 
It's no use. 
I'm just gonna have to replace 'em. 
But where am i ever gonna get $2,500? 
Well,why don't you just do like I do and sell your autograph at the car show?

IF YOU SEE SOMETHING,SAY SOMETHING IF YOU SUSPECT ANYTHING,DO EVERYTHING WE DON'T POISON THE WORLD.TERRORISTS DO. 
Thank you for an incredible night. 
Really? Did you 
have a good time? 
'Cause I really did. 
Unbelievably good. 
And thank you for letting me try the thing I tried. I'M... 
sorry I dropped you. 
Oh,no,it was great. 
I mean,who knew that ottoman had wheels,right? 
Well,I gotta get to work. 
Uh,when can i see you again? 
Anytime. You name it. 
congressman cunningham,it is a pleasure to have you on our program. 
Hi,dan. Thank 
you for having me. 
Celeste cunningham. 
C.C. 
You didn't tell me you're a congresswoman! 
I just ended my first year. 
but also on some of your constituents. 
"D"? 
Vermont? 
Big business is out to get us again. 
The sheinhardt wig company has dumped thousands of gallons of auburn fantasy dye #260 into the chickotagua river, turning the children of chickotagua orange. 
And I will not rest until this company and all of its subsidiaries are held financially responsible! 
Why do you have this? 
I run a sheinhardt wig subsidiary called nbc. 
Oh,my god. 
You're jack donaghy? 
What were you even doing at that party last night? 
Oh,my god. This was a mistake. 
Forget about what I said. I can 
never be seen with you again. 
You're right. 
We have to pretend that this never happened. 
Yeah,I have to get out of here. 
Damn it,the worst part is... 
I really liked you a lot. 
I gave her the ottoman,and she walked out. 
Sir,I typed up that letter. 
Hey,uh... 
what do you need,lemon? 
Nothing,I just,uh... 
it can wait. 
Lemon,there's nothing you could say to me that you can't say in front of jonathan. 
I think my middle eastern neighbor is a terrorist,and I don't know what to do. 
That's ridiculous,lemon. 
Some of our greatest patriots have been of middle eastern descent. 
And I'm appalled to hear you engage in racial profiling like that. 
I'm kidding. 
Be an american-call it in. 
This is the number of a friend of mine in a very high-level position at homeland security. 
Oh,no,not- now I don't know. 
Maybe I'm just being paranoid. 
If a bleeding heart liberal like you has any suspicions... 
I know,right? 
Nice ring tone,jack. 
That's not my ring tone. 
I hate that san francisco sound. 
How am I calling myself? 
This isn't even my phone. 
Jack? 
 C.C.? 
I think I have your phone. 
Yeah,you must have grabbed it by accident. 
After our night of doing it. 
Take the freight elevator to the sixth floor,and I'll be right down. 
are you all right? 
Well,last night I... 
never mind. 
These verizon wireless phones are just so popular. 
I accidentally grabbed one belonging to an acquaintance. 
Well,sure,'cause that verizon wireless service is just unbeatable. 
I mean,if I saw a phone like that on tv, I would be like,"where is my nearest retailer so I can...get one?" 
Can we have our money now? 
Come on... big money. 
This ketchup expired two years ago. 
Dude,how much would I have to pay you to eat this whole bottle? 
Honestly? 
I got all the way to harlem when I heard wagner coming from my phone. 
Harlem? 
I'm working out of the clinton offices for a few weeks. 
I'm helping hillary retool her universal health care platform. 
God,I wanna kiss you on the mouth to stop you from saying such ridiculous things. 
Here's your phone. 
Obviously,we can never be seen together again. 
Obviously-I'm up for the chairmanship,and I don't wanna risk that. 
They give you a helicopter,you know. 
What about me? 
How can I look those little orange children in the eye? 
They have no other documented health problems,you know. 
They're orange! 
This is why I got into politics to stop big companies from hurting the little guy. 
What happened to you that made you this way? 
In 1998,I got shot in the face by my neighbor's dog. 
Oh,C.C.,I'm 
so- wait,what? 
My neighbor had a riverton hunting rifle with a faulty trigger safety. 
One day,his jack russell terrier started chewing the area, the gun went off,and shot me in the face. 
No. 
A terrier? 
So I did what was right: I sued riverton,my neighbor,and the dog. 
C.C.,I'm so sorry. 
Well,don't be. 
After six reconstructive surgeries, I'm much better-looking now than I used to be. 
Plus,they made a lifetime movie about me. 
tonight on lifetime,candace van der shark stars as celeste cunningham A dog took my face and gave me a better face to change the worid: The celeste cunningham story You know,I thought you made love like an ugly girl. 
So present,so grateful. 
Who's that? 
Nobody. 
Don't lie to me,jack. 
I've had plenty of women mad at me the morning after. 
Just don't let her light your sneakers on fire in the bathtub. 
Oh,she would never do that,tracy. 
She's a very special woman. 
So then what's the problem? 
Well,we're just on opposite sides of a feud. 
Oh,I get it: Romeo and juliet. 
Capulets and romulans. 
Mm-hmm,I've been there. 
I'm black,she's white. 
I'm black,she's light-skinned black. 
I'm black,she's 17. 
Hey,listen,if she's your soul mate,you go for it. 
Tracy,I don't believe in soul mates. 
I worked too hard to get where I am to sacrifice it for some woman. 
I don't care if she is beautiful,brilliant, and she does it like her dad's a minister. 
Sir,that was impressive! 
My feet are puffed up real bad. 
Dude,let us give you the rest of the money for donaghy's pants. 
No,mr.Rossitano. 
We parcells are neither wealthy nor circumcised,but we are proud. 
I have to earn that money. 
All right,I got a job for you. 
Every night after dinner,lutz falls asleep on the couch in our office. 
Can I help you? 
Pete!Pete! 
Pete! 
Raheem! 
Ready to go? 
You guys are going out? 
 Yeah. 
My buddy,raheem,invited me out with him to celebrate. 
He just completed some big project he's been working on. 
Soon everyone will know the name raheem haddad. 
Hi,I'm not sure,but who is he,and where can we find him? 
Hey,C.C. 
We're having a barbecue tonight. You're welcome to come. 
Thanks. Maybe I will. 
Get the gun away from the dog. 
Hey,hon,have you seen my hunting rifle? 
Last time I saw it... the dog had it. 
What is wrong with you people? 
I'm going to get into politics! 
Got him! 
Ape attack! 
Ape attack. 
Smarts! 
Are you okay? 
Okay,that went too far. 
I still need $700. 
What's next? 
You know that old lady in accounting... 
who thinks you're her husband who died in the war? 
What about her? 
I do believe in destiny. 
And I know that i should hate you,but I can'T. 
I love you. 
And I don't care what people say. 
We were meant to be in each other's lives. 
You're right,C.C. 
Some dudes took raheem last night. 
sounds like an american hero saw something and said something. 
Elizabeth lemon,I can't believe you did that. 
Raheem is a good guy! 
You seem to be defending raheem an awful lot. 
I'd hate to have to make another phone call. 
No,we're cool. 
Uh,I renounce raheem. 
Raheem's a bad guy. 
Usa number one! 
Tracy,I need your help. 
I've gotta go somewhere,and I can't be seen,and cabs don't go there. 
Sure,where is it? 
Clinton's office in harlem. 
I know where that building is. 
I get my jamaican meat pies there. 
Finally,my scalp rx. 
I know you are in the media.Please 
get this in the right hands.Raheem 
Oh,my god. 
I am raheem haddad. 
And this is my brother hakim. 
And these are the reasons you should choose us to be the next contestants on the amazing race! 
Amazing what? 
THE AMAZING RACE**** We love to travel. 
Look at all the places we have been: Toronto,munich,london,the hoover dam,the cleve. 
Oh,boy. 
we are in good shape for the road blocks and detours. 
Come on,go! 
Oh,no,oh,no. 
we love america! 
Oh,no. 
Oh,no. 
jonathan... 
I purchased a replacement pair of mr.Donaghy's pants. 
You must love him as much as I do. 
C.C.,Look out the 
window onto 125th street. 
You shouldn't be here. 
I know I shouldn'T. 
I can't help myself. 
I wanna be with you! 
Tell her you want your privates and her privates to do a high-five. 
Okay,tray,I got this. 
Jack,we hardly know each other. 
This could be career suicide for both of us,and you know it! 
I don't care anymore. 
I saw your movie- what you said to that dog about soul mates. 
I think I might be the dog. 
Tell her her butt look like a apple and you wanna take a bite. 
Buzz me in,okay? 
Tell her she got some tig ol' biddies like the dallas cowboy cheerleaders. 
Tell her you want her to donate her body to science,and you science. 
Tell her,jack! 
I've been going crazy these last few days,thinking about our night together. 
How you wanted to brush my hair as foreplay. 
How you made me that western omelet at 4:00 A.M. 
I never met anyone like you,jack. 
Be with me,C.C. 
We'll ignore our differences till the sex goes bad,then we'll... 
walk away bitter and angry. 
Nobody can know we're together. 
Not even your friend tracy jordan out there. 
I don't think you have to worry about tracy. 
Stop eatin' people's old french fries,pigeon. Have some self-respect. 
Don't you know you can fly? 
I don'T... 
I've never had a secret affair before. 
What do you say we go find a spot and defile this place? 
Raheem. Hey,buddy! 
Where ya been all week? 
They put electrodes on my testicles,liz. 
Who did? 
Oh,you... remembered my name. 
America's government shocked my nuts. 
No,I'm pretty sure they're not allowed to do that type of thing. 
They say,"raheem...why 
you no shake hands?" 
I say,"because I don't want sickness before amazing race." 
They say,"raheem,why all the trips to the airport?" 
I say,"because I'm practicing for the amazing race!" 
And then,"zzt!Zzt!" 
In my underpanties! 
Do you have any idea who... turned you in? 
No... 
but I am just so angry now. 
I have so much anger inside. 
I want to do something spectacular with it. 
Northrax. 
Hey! I made waffles. 
thank god. 
 Yeah. 
It is with great pleasure I would like to announce that the recipient of this year's prestigious ge follohip award is none other than our very own. 
liz lemon. 
Wait,how could liz win a fellowship award? 
She doesn't like people. 
No,followship. 
Presented annually to the woman. 
sorry,person,who best exemplifies a foller. 
I'm not a follower. 
It also comes with ten grand. 
I accept this proudly on behalf of followers everywhere. 
When I think of the free. 
spirited liz lemon I met just one year ago. 
So resistant to product integration,cross. 
It pleases me to see how well she's learned to follow. 
Uh,is this because of that ge sketch? 
He has a microwave for a head! 
But it's such an excellent ge microwave. 
You said i didn't have a choice. 
So what are you gonna do with your money,put it into a 401k? 
Yeah,I gotta get one of those. 
What? 
Where do you invest your mo ms. 
*** *** ***I can't believe how fast you lost the weight. 
If I can't be monique fat,I have to be teri hatcher thin. 
Either way,you're laughin'. 
My uniform! 
Let me get that off. 
Turn around. 
It just needs a little bit of water. 
Oh,god,it hurts! 
Proudly Presents 30 Rock Season 2 Episode 4 You're honestly telling me you don't know who rosemary howard is. 
Is she one of the ladies who tried to shoot gerald ford? 
No!She's the first female 
writer for laugh.in. 
She wrote all the political stuff for donnie and marie. 
I grew up idolizing her comedy. 
Pardon me. 
Pardon me.Pardon me! 
Pardon you? 
You were already pardoned! 
It's funny 'cause it's true. 
Hi,I don't wanna sound like a weirdo fan�� but Iam obsessed with everything you have ever done. 
And I used to make my friends act out your skits the next day. 
When I say my friends,I mean my fisher price. 
my friend dolls. 
Because I didn't have a lot of friends. 
Oh,boy.*** 
You're gonna kill me,aren't you? 
No,that's. 
Oh,you are great! 
I grew up wanting to be you. 
I grew up wanting to be samantha stevens on bewitched. 
Closest I got was being married to a gay guy for two years. 
Oh,thank you. 
Um,you are my heroine. 
And by heroine,I mean lady hero. 
I don't wanna inject you and listen to jazz. 
Good lord. 
 Are you hungry? 
 Always. 
Well,I'm gonna let you take me to lunch later and get all this out of your system. 
That would be great. 
I would love that. 
But you're supposed to take me hat shopping. 
Hey jack! 
Could you hold on a second? 
If you desecrate something,is that bad? 
Tracy,what happened now? 
I doubt if anybody noticed. 
Who brought stars and bright stars to the party last night for the rascals we fought who wouldhave ever known there was so many words? 
It was like a mos def cd. 
Tracy,it's all right. 
You're a star,you can do whatever you want to. 
That's your job. 
It's our job to make it go away. 
I love this country. 
You go forth and be crazy. 
I think I can manage that. 
You do anything you wanna do. 
Except no dog fighting,okay? 
That seems to be the one thing that's off limits these days. 
What's on your mind,tray? 
You've been curiously quiet for 20 minutes. 
We gotta start doing dog fights. 
Dog fighting? 
I know it's repulsive and hideous. 
But it's the only thing jack donaghy told me I cannot do. 
So I gotta do it!Understand? 
No no no no no no no! 
Dog fighting is the most disgusting,vile thing a human being can do. 
You cannot do it! 
Dog fighting it is. 
Make it happen. 
Man,this is phil spector's entourage all over again. 
And his foot lingered. 
Ah,that is such an upsetting story. 
I'll never watch happy days the same way again. 
But you know,I miss live tv. 
It's like sex,you know? 
It's almost better when everything goes horribly wrong. 
Well,you know,we do hire guest writers every now and then. 
I mean,I don't know if that'S. 
something you would ever be interested in. 
That'd be great. 
God,I haven't been in that building in so long. 
Does everyone still do blow in joe garagiola's office? 
Which one is blow again?Is that cocaine? 
Hello?Where's the head page? 
You may enter. 
You're a machine. 
No,I wish. 
This is a prop from the classic nbc series supercomputer. 
1975 to 1975. 
Look,you obviously know who I am. 
But what you don't know is that I accidentally damaged kenneth parcell's page jacket and. 
Really? 
Mr. Perfect,Mr. Jesus loves 
me parcell finally messed up? 
Do you know how long i've been waiting to transfer that thumbhead to cnbc in paramus,new jersey? 
But you can't transfer someone without a demerit. 
 But now. 
 oh,boy. 
Here's what we're gonna do. 
You've probably never seen breasts before. 
So I'm gonna lean over this desk,and you're gonna give me a new page jacket. 
Please,I breast fed 'til I was 11. 
So I've forgotten more about a woman's chest than you'll ever know. 
But.I'm on tv. 
I said,"good day. 
" No,you didn'T. 
Well,I meant to. 
Kenneth parcell is finished. 
Finished! 
All right,what's in the news this week,everybody? 
Any ideas? 
I have an idea. 
We open on a new orleans abortion clinic. 
A beautiful mulatto. 
uh,I don't think we're allowed to use any of those words. 
Why not? 
It's live television. 
I mean,we used to say And . 
no,you didn'T. 
Did you? 
We did.We pushed the envelope. 
Remember. 
the mailbox sketch that shocked america? 
There's nothing wrong here. 
Don't you get it? 
The mailbox was haldeman. 
Is that a person who lived? 
What about race? 
I mean,I say that is the last taboo. 
We get josh in blackface,right? 
And then we get tracy to call him a ! 
I'd watch that. 
No no,you can't do race stuff on tv.It's too sensitive. 
We would have done that on the mandrell sisters! 
Look,I want the show to be edgy too. 
I mean,but my boss,jack donaghy. 
let me talk to him. 
 I am great with suits. 
 No,we don't talk to him. 
Liz,you're not a cog in their machine. 
I know. 
I'm not some. 
follower. 
I just. 
we are very subversive on this show. 
Frank,what do you have this week? 
Uh,barry the humping dog is shopping for a ge washer and dryer. 
Have not seen that before. 
Sharp idea. 
Yo,I got the dogs outside. 
Well,bring them in! 
I feel sick to my stomach about dog fighting. 
But what can you do when they tell you not to? 
This could get ugly. 
What? 
No! 
You idiots! 
I built a dog fighting pit in my basement for this? 
Tracy. 
Can I speak with you privately? 
Tray,what's the one thing i asked you not to do? 
That 227 movie new jackee city? 
Dog fighting! 
What is it about your wiring that compels you to do exactly what you're asked not to? 
I don't know. 
Always been this way. 
Tracy,don't play with matches! 
You're not my dad! 
Tracy,don't stare directly at the sun.It'll make you crazy. 
You're not my dad. 
Tracy,you're not going out the house dressed like that. 
You're not my dad. 
I'm beginning to think this has something to do with your dad. 
You're not my dad! 
You can't tell me what it's about. 
Hey,props gave me a bunch of dog penises for you to look at. 
Oh,great,thanks. 
Liz! 
Your grandmother is in jack's office. 
You better do something. 
Nana lemon?That's weird. 
Oh,no. 
Rosemary. 
Lemon,rosemary here was just telling me some of her fantastic sketch ideas. 
Liz,he totally gets it. 
He understands that what we do is far more important than what they do. 
I do.I really do get it. 
Rosemary,thank you so very much. 
Oh,no,my pleasure. 
What a pleasure.What 
fun catching up with you. 
You too. 
 You take care now. 
 You too. 
Fire her. 
And don't ever make me talk to a woman that old again. 
I can't fire rosemary. 
Yes,you can.It's easy. 
Observe. 
Jonathan,you're fired! 
What? No! God,no! 
No,I won't fire her. It's mean. 
And I like her. And she's right,we 
should be pushing the envelope. 
Oh,god. Push the envelope. 
People who don't have the guts or the brains to work inside the system. 
Letter writers,radicals,howard dean. 
You just don't get her. You're 
like the talking mailbox. 
I'm going to assume that's a haldeman reference. In which case,I thank you. 
I got into this business to be like rosemary. To make people think. 
No. No no no,lemon. 
You got into this business because you're funny and you're weird and you're socially retarded. 
And you also got into it because it pays well,which means you are not like rosemary; you are like me. 
No,I'm not. You are a suit. 
You feed off the creativity and hard work of other people and turn it into commercials and pie charts and triangle graphs. 
What's a triangle graph? 
I don't know! It sounded real. 
This is my show. 
No,this is my show. 
And once a week I rent it out to the good people at the erectile dysfunction companies. 
Be that as it may,rosemary is my idol. 
And if you wanna get rid of her,then you will fire me also. 
suck it up,nerd. 
Oh,my god! 
Rosemary,that was such a rush standing up to jack like that. 
And I never would have done it if it weren't for you. 
I am so proud of you! 
He heard you roar and now things are gonna change around here. 
Jack says you're both fired. 
Yes! 
Hey tray,whatcha doing? 
Just some heavy thinking. 
This spotlight is the only place that I could go to get away from it all. 
You know,tray,I get this dad thing. 
I mean my father belongs in the smiling irish bastard hall of fame. 
And the pent. up,unresolved anger i 
have toward him,it still overwhelms me. 
You've got to learn to forgive. 
But how do I forgive someone that I don't know? 
Boy,if I could just talk to him once. Just once. 
Tracy,we're gonna do this together. 
You've got to get into therapy. 
I don't need therapy. 
I'm just mentally ill. 
Tracy,what if I told you that the one thing you cannot do is therapy? 
You're not my dad! We're doing therapy! 
All right,thank you. Good. bye. 
Kenneth,I may have made a mistake. 
I was talking to donnie. 
donnie? 
Head page donnie lawson,the king of sting? 
What did you do? 
I was just trying to make things right. 
Nice jacket,parcell. I hope that it and you 
will be very unhappy at cnbc for the next year. 
Of course,there is one other choice. 
A page. off. 
A page. off? 
It's a savage contest. Mixing 
physical stamina with nbc trivia. 
What's a page. off? 
You wanna page. off? 
I don't know what kind of corporate mind games he's playing. 
But if jack thinks i'm crawling back there. 
oh,screw him. But now that you're 
free,we can work on something together! 
Yeah,we can start our own network called bitch tv! 
Or the second idea that we think of. 
Look,when we get back to my place,we start banging out some ideas. 
Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life. 
What neighborhood is this? 
Oh,they call it little chechnya. So gritty and real. 
More murders per capita than detroit. 
Try not to write when you're living here. 
Is that guy carrying a gun? 
Yeah,but don't worry. He's not a cop. 
Hey,tracy,this is susanne hawker,the nbc therapist. 
Who's crazier,me or anne curry? 
Hello,tracy. Jack informed me 
of the talk you had earlier. 
And if you don't mind,I'd like to hop right in and start with some role play. 
Like my wife and I do? Cool. 
Donaghy,you play the matador. 
Uh,no,tracy. What I want you to do is talk to that 
empty chair as if your father were sitting there,okay? 
Man,this is stupid! 
Come on,tracy. We're here to help you. 
Uh,tracy,maybe it will help if jack sits in the chair and pretends to be your father. 
I wanna talk to you,son. 
You sound nothing like my dad. 
Well,where is he from? 
All I know is he's from funky north philly. 
He worked in a campbell's soup factory. And he 
had a droopy lip due to an unattended root canal. 
I think I can do this. Okay,go. 
I'm mad at you,dad. 
Hey,dummy! I'm mad at you too. 
Uh,that's not exactly what I had in. 
'cause you left me,dad! 
I was young and confused and your moms didn't want me around no more. 
Now,pass me them damn collard greens! 
Is this true,mom? 
He gambled away my welfare check. 
Woman,I got a mind to smack you upside the head. 
Uh,this is not helpful. 
Be me now. 
I only act out because I want your love! Dyn.o.mite! 
I think we're just doing good times now. 
Now do the white dude that my moms left my dad for. 
Uh,now,see here,tracy. It's 
impolite to slurp one's soup. 
Whoa,no need to resort to ugly stereotypes. 
You always gonna be my son. 
Tracy,just because i stopped loving your dad,doesn't mean we stopped loving you. 
Stop puttin' words in my mouth,woman! 
Oye,papi,kayate! People are sleeping! 
Mind your own damn business,mrs.Rodriguez! 
All right,this is ridiculous. 
Lady,just because i'm an ignorant black man. 
And you paid me a nickel to bust up your chifforobe,doesn't give you the right to call me ridiculous just 'cause I'm proud of my son. 
They got me. 
The honkeys shot me. 
No,dad! 
Don't die! I love you,dad! 
I don't wanna dog fight no more! 
Tracy,that's it! That's it! 
Thank you for showing me there really is love in my family after all. 
And I need to stay the hell away from them. 
Donaghy,you're the only family I need,jackie D. 
You got that right,tray. 
You know,it's too bad you didn't know howard cosell when you were growing up. 'Cause I had that one in my pocket the whole time. 
There we are. 
Oh,crapballs! What was that? 
Okay,let's find a pen and start that screenplay. 
This movie is gonna knock them on their asses. 
Right. What's it about? 
Women in their 50s go on spring break and get laid by a bunch of grateful 18.year.olds. 
Oh,god. 
Yeah,exactly. 
I predict opening weekend,a million dollars. 
Have you been drinking wine all day? 
Oh,it's heart healthy. 
All day? 
Oh,come on,liz. It's the '90s! 
Did an f train just go by your window? 
I know that look. Don't even 
think about jumping for that train. 
You know,I think i should go home before it gets dark. 
You can't abandon me,liz. You are me. 
No,I'm not you. 
Really? You pick up guys 
that are smart and funny. 
You're never gonna get married,liz. 
You're married to your job. 
Oh,my god. I lost my job. 
You're just like me. 
You get up in the morning and smoke weed. 
no,I don'T. 
You obsess about the jamaican man across the hall. 
Oh,my god. I lost my job. 
You wouldn't have a job if it wasn't for me. I broke barriers for you. 
I really have to go. 
I sat around while my junk went bad. All for you. 
I didn't have any kids. You're my kid! 
You're my kid that never calls! 
yikes. 
Help me,liz lemon! You're my only hope! 
Okay,which nbc series spun off,among others,cosby,miami vice,cheers,and highway to heaven? 
Supercomputer! 
Oh,you're gonna do great! 
Ready! 
Page.off,page.off 
Come on,kenneth! You can do it! 
Hey! What the hell 
is going on down here? 
The phones are ringing off the hook,there's no one seating the conan audience! 
Get to back to work,you morons! 
Pete,wait. You don't understand. 
I ruined kenneth's jacket and he needs to get a new one,but can't have any demerits,so we have to have a page.off. 
what,are you kidding me? This 
is a billion dollar company! 
Demerits? 
Donnie,give kenneth a damn jacket! 
This isn't over between us,moroney. You're in it now. 
It's finally over,ms.Moroney. 
Yes. And it's hard to even 
remember how it all began. 
You burnt my jacket. 
All right,I need my job back. 
But this is not crawling,this is proud begging,like those kids that dance on the subway. 
Of course you can have your job back,lemon. 
Oh,thank god. It was terrible. 
I went to her apartment. I 
don't think she has a toilet. 
I saw my future,jack. 
Never go with a hippie to a second location. 
I can't end up like that. I have 
got to make money and save it. 
And I have to do that thing that rich people do where they turn money into more money. 
Can you teach me how to do that? 
With my eyes closed. 
Oh,good,because I want to send rosemary $400 a month for. forever. 
You should,that woman is unemployable. 
Rosemary says that women become obsolete in this business when there's no one left that wants to see them naked. 
You make enough money,you can pay people to look at you naked. 
To the future,lemon. 
Oh,and by the way,ge has a problem with the dog penis sketch. 
I'll change it. 
Hey,what about cat penises? 
******holy hot mamas! 
But who will be the final mommy that you'd like to oh,you know. 
I came here to be number one! 
coming up next,here on nbc. 
Are you guys gonna do any work today or zip it. Milf island is on. 
20 milfs, 50 eighth-grade boys, no rules. 
And tonight,one winner. 
Welcome to milf island. 
This show is the worst. 
Didn't one of thos milfs die during production? 
She had too much champagne, and a monkey knocked her into some quicksand. 
It could happen anywhere. 
miss lemon,we might have a problem. 
I went through the paper looking for that article on speed dating  that you asked about... 
 uh,buh duh jee jee je... 
when I came across this. 
Who... 
did... this? 
Who did what? 
This is from today's page 6 gossip column. 
"Which tgs with tracy jordan staffer " called corporate honcho jack donaghy "a class 'a' moron? 
"Donaghy is up for the G.E.Chairmanship, 
"but one employee has misgivings, adding,'that guy can eat my poo.'" 
Who said this? 
 not me. 
 Not me. 
 It wasn't me. 
 I wasn't even working that day. 
Liz... 
mr. Donaghy would like to see 
you in his office immediately. 
Well,it better not be about that quote because I am not taking the bullet for this! 
This is bad. Like,lose you job bad. 
Prepare for the craziest night of television of your life. 
proudly presents 30 Rock  Season02 Episode11 Well,I'm going to get yelled at. 
What's going on with you? 
The season finale of milf island. 
and I'm gonna watch it alone in my office. 
That's pretty grim,pete. 
Ooh,a dangler! 
Liz,I'm gonna get free food. 
It's soy joy. 
Who doesn't love soy joy? 
Somebody upstairs has changed their mind about old pete hornberger. 
I'm stuck! 
Lemon... 
remember this? 
Deborah and shauna squaring off at erection cove. 
um,I don'T. I don't 
really watch this show. 
that deborah's amazing. 
Have you heard her story? 
Before she was cast on milf island, she was just a struggling actress living in L.A. 
Wow,that's inspiring. 
She has real star quality. 
You should meet with her. 
Wait,is that why you called me up here? 
Sir,I have sumner redstone calling to congratulate you. 
I'll return. 
The calls have been pouring in all night. 
Milf island's huge. 
I guess I should be out celebrating, but I'm waiting for a call from don geiss. 
You think he'll call me "jackie-boy"? 
Then I'll be at erection cove. 
Congratulations,jack. 
You must be very proud. 
When you meet with deborah, have her do her indian cab driver impression. 
She--she really pulls it off. 
Now,why would I meet with her? 
Because we're developing a spin-off, and I thought you could write it. 
Oh,,thanks! 
I don't want anything to do with milf island. 
That show is kinda lowest common denominator. 
The critics said that same thing about shakespeare. 
Yeah,but shakespeare never had a confessional shower sponsored by dove pro-age. 
So you have seen the show. 
And why shouldn't you? 
It has sex,lies,puberty, betrayal,relay races. 
Milf island reflects the drama of the human experience. 
And isn't that the essence of art? 
I don't think eating bugs to earn tampons... 
episode nine. 22 million viewers. 
Is art. Performance is an art. 
Writing is an art. What we do is art. 
Someone put too many farts in this engine! 
It's about to explode! 
Okay,fine. Don't meet with her. 
I just saw the opportunity for you to make An obscene amount of money. 
Well,no thanks. I have integrity. 
It's farting! It's farting! 
Myirt. 
Anyway,unless there's something else, I'm just gonna... 
actually,we do need to resolve the page six debacle. 
You know,if you google the phrase "class 'a' moron," my name pops up first now. 
So step aside, randy quaid. 
Jack,I'm sorry you saw that. 
It's not good timing for me,professionally. 
I will find out who did it. 
I'll beat it out of them. 
No,no,here's how we're gonna play this situation. 
We're gonna turn up the heat on your people... 
and see who breaks first. 
Jonathan... 
could you round up those idiots hey,buddies. 
he knows,doesn't he? 
Yeah,and he's not happy. 
Does he think it's me? 
Did he--did he mention me? 
No,I think you're safe because I think he forgot that you're a person. 
Yeah! 
Come on,how long is this gonna take? 
Our pizzas are downstairs, and the tribunal was just about to make one of the last four milfs hang up her bikini top. 
Zalutha... 
you've kept it tight. 
Heidi... 
we no longer want to hit that. 
Get off milf island! 
Can I just get the pizzas and bring them up here? 
No,no,you have to stay here in case mr. Donaghy calls you in. 
Look,whoever did this needs to fess up now. 
I can protect you. 
I just need to know who it is. 
Fine,everybody but me close your eyes. 
Whoever did it, raise your hand. 
Oh,really mature,guys! 
You are on your own. 
Miss lemon,can I have a word with you,please? 
Lutz,come here. 
We should form an alliance. 
A what? 
An alliance. 
We're the two biggest dirtbags around here. 
They're gonna try to blame us. 
I don't think people see me that way. 
Yeah,they do. You and me. 
A couple of fat pervert losers. 
My sister-in-law did kinda a makeover on me. I thought 
no. No. 
Hello? A little help! 
My shirt is caught on what feels like a very sharp... 
mechanism. 
Ooh,maybe if I can get the shirt off. 
What? 
What is it,kenneth? 
Well,I was thinking about this item in the newspaper, and something doesn't make sense. 
What do you mean? 
Well,I know toofer would never use the word "poo," so it's not him. 
And frank couldn't have done it because he was with me all day making fun of my haircut. 
And also, I saw you do it. 
The game... is about...to change! 
What do you mean you saw me do it? 
It was yesterday, downstairs. 
Liz lemon,I'm gonna miss the show this week. 
Jack is sending me to do stand-up in dubai. 
I'm gonna do jokes on airplane food. 
It's all new to them. 
No,tracy,you can't miss the show. 
Well,don't blame me, blame jack. 
He's the one I'm splitting the $3 million with. 
You and jack donaghy are the cause of my jawline acne! 
You work for jack donaghy? 
That class "a" moron? Unfortunately. 
Must be tough taking orders from a guy like that,huh? 
I don't take orders from him. He's an idiot. 
He doesn't know what he's doing. That guy can eat my poo. 
 Do you work here too? 
 No. 
I'm a reporter for the new york post, specializing in business gossip. 
And then you asked him if he was single, and he said,"don't worry about it," but then okay,fine,you got me! I did it. 
But I am not taking the fall for this one. 
I have taken too many bullets for my idiot staff in the past. 
Jonathan,did someone turn the heat up? 
No idea. 
Where I'm from, we don't notice the heat. 
that's interesting. 
I didn't know it was hot in assholevania. 
I deserve one free pass. 
But that's not the right thing to do. 
Yes,yes,kenneth. 
But jack and i are friends. 
It would screw things up if this came out. 
What if I really messed up his chances of getting that promotion? 
I would be so sad if I got caught for this. 
But you're not supposed to lie. 
You apple-faced goon! 
Fine,I will tell him. 
Oh,pray for me. 
Really? 
Is everyone watching tv? 
Yes! Okay,okay... 
Okay... 
I just need four numbers. 
Call anybody in the building. 
Any... random...number. 
Yes! Hornberger! 
Hello,you've reached pete hornberger at tgs. 
Please leave a message. 
A class "a" moron. 
Yeah, how are you doing? 
Lemon,can I share something with you that I've never shared with anyone in my life? 
I would rather you didn'T. 
When I was a child, I had a terrible stutter. 
And I was so embarrassed by it that I rarely spoke in class. 
You were a stutterer? 
Couldn't get a word out. 
Needless to say I was the object of some ridicule. 
Because of my reticence, they assumed I was stupid, and the massachusetts public school system designated me a class "a" moron. 
Oh,no. 
the stutter got so bad i was taken out of my grade and put in the special class held in the boiler room. 
My only other classmate was named gilly. 
He'd fallen through the ice as a child and was technically dead for 57 minutes. 
They taught us to sweep sawdust so we could find work at a mill. 
I'm sure whoever said that thing in the post had no idea of course,I overcame the stutter in three languages. 
On to princeton,harvard, the top of the business world. 
I thought i'd blocked this out, but a thing like this brings back some old emotions. 
I'm so sorry. 
I feel like I'm back in that boiler room making little piles of sawdust while gilly plays with himself in the corner. 
I'm sorry, did you want something? 
I just wanted to tell you... 
that I've narrowed it down to toofer or frank. 
Thank you. 
God,I am famished. 
those are jack's! 
Come on,guys. 
Whoever did it,just confess so we can get out of here. 
Why are you looking at me and lutz? 
I wasn'T. 
I think lutz'll tell you that I'm innocent. 
No,I won't,dude. 
What the frak? 
I thought we had a dirtbag alliance! 
I'm not a dirtbag. 
This is from amican eagle! 
You formed an alliance? 
That strongly insinuates guilt. 
Well,I think pointing fingers at people makes you seem guilty. 
Thanks,judas. 
 I thought we had a deal. 
 You lis! 
Who cares if you went to harvard? Who cares? 
Debra, what was the hardest part of this for you? 
I would have to say... 
the physical challenges. 
I mean,you're tired, hungry, want to go home. 
And then you just reach inside yourself, and you find the strength that you didn't even know you had. 
I mean,one of my implants exploded... 
and I didn't even ask to get off the catapult. 
now,boys,there are only two milfs left: Debra and deborah. 
But one of them is going home. 
And it will be revealed... 
after three more breaks. 
Deborah's played the game so well. 
Even if she loses, america's gonna want more. 
Maybe it's a talk show. 
No,jack,I'm not working on it. 
Jonathan,turn up the heat a little more and send in kenneth. 
Kenneth? 
We're gonna get to the bottom of this. 
He won't know anything. 
Kenneth... 
you're the eyes and ears of tgs. 
So liz and I were hoping you could help us to track down the person who's been saying these hurtful things about me in the paper. 
Well,sir,I'm sure that whoever did this regrets her... 
or his mistake, and will do the right thing. 
I certainly hope so. 
Do you have any guesses? 
Kenneth,I need an answer. 
The stress of this is making me awful sleepy. 
sir, there's a call on two i think you're gonna want to take. 
Mr. Geiss,I-- oh,hello, 
vice president cheney. 
I'm gonna kill you. 
Yes,I hope deborah wins as well. 
No,they're not real, unfortunately. 
Get out of here! 
I can't believe you didn't tell him! 
You listen to me, li'l abner. 
Keep your fried baloney hole shut! 
I am not going down for this! 
I'll tell him you did it. 
Who do you think he's gonna believe? 
I'm important around here. 
Miss lemon,your eyes look like my uncle's after he would drink from the air-conditioner. 
I thought we were friends. 
I didn't come here to make friends. 
I came here to be number one! 
liz lemon! 
I can't believe they put what you said in the paper. 
Shh--how do you know about that? 
this is a cathy cartoon! 
Yeah,that cartoon copied exactly what you said the other Y. 
Chocolate,chocolate, chocolate! Aack! 
If you decide to sue them, I know a good lawyer! 
Took me to the cleers last year. 
the truth will come out. 
Like my cousin steven after he went to music college, it will come out. 
stay tuned for one final, shocking twist. 
Shut up! 
Brought to you buy soy joy. 
Fortified with optimism. 
Jack,it's almost 11:00. 
Why don't you let thos guys go home, and we'll all sleep on it? 
They called me stammerhead shark,lemon. 
What? 
The kids at school. 
They called me names. 
Mrs. Stutterworth, stutterfingers... 
stuttermilk pancakes. 
The butter thing opened up a lot of doors for them. 
You know,I wore corrective shoes as a kid. 
Really? 
When I was born, I had a malformed extra baby foot extending from my actual foot. 
They think maybe i ate my twin. 
But after the surgery to remove it, I walked pigeon-toed. 
So all through grade school, I had to wear corrective foot gear that attached to a headgear. 
Gilly chewed through his headgear. 
My point is,I survived. 
It made me a better person. 
And he same is true of you. 
All this,all your success is because of that certificate. 
It made you who you are. 
And that is not a bad thing. 
Thank you,lemon. 
Look. The final council is starting. 
Deborah has the bearing of a queen. 
 Maybe you did it! 
 Why would I do it? 
 That is so stupid. 
 You know people at page six! 
I hate all of you! 
Order! Order,I say! 
We must not be rash. 
We must divorce ourselves from our prejudices, and appeal to our higher reasoning. 
This is the speaking banana. 
Everyone will get a chance to speak,and only then will we make our decision. 
Josh,my friend, you are first. 
Look,I would never do this because I'm loyal to the show. 
That dude did it! 
I knew it was you! 
Look at his light eyes. 
They're freaky like a wolf! 
Keep it down! 
Why are you still here? 
I love it up here. It's 
hot,it's loud, there's no pizza. 
It's like miami. 
Maybe liz did it. 
Are you kidding me? 
After all the times i have defended you guys and covered up for you, How dare you accuse me! 
you say you're sorry right now. 
I'm sorry. 
Please don't cry, it's making me feel weird. 
I can't take this anymore. 
I'm going to put an end to it. 
I said those bad things about you in the newspaper,sir. 
Kenneth,you? 
I couldn't lie anymore,sir. 
Because everyone knows the weight of a lie makes your soul so heavy that you can't rise up to heaven. 
And you don't look good in jeans from behind. 
But why,kenneth? 
Is it because I made you work late last night? 
Yes,sir. That was it. 
I was here folding milf island tee shirts until 2:00 in the morning. 
And then you didn't even offer me one. 
Needless to say i grumbled about you to anyone who would listen. 
Don't know what to say, kenneth. 
You've embarrassed yourself and the show. 
You may have compromised my chances of running this company. 
And needless to say, you've hurt me personally. 
Lemon,do you have anything you want to add? 
You disgust me. 
 Well,that's over. 
 deborah wins! 
She played the game so well. 
She manipulated,she lied. 
She got a pretty bad staph infection. 
But tonight, deborah is our winner. 
Who won? 
myirt! 
Jack,what are you doing here? 
Geiss called me. 
Oh,good. 
I've never heard him sound so happy. 
He called me "jackie boy." 
And deborah's testing off the charts in the most profitable demographics. 
Soccer moms,nascar dads, white-collar pervs, and the obese. 
Congratulations. 
I've really come a long way since that heart attack, havet I,lemon? 
Geiss' job is mine to lose. 
There's just one thing still bothering me. 
Kenneth's story doesn't add up. 
You want some pizza? 
Kenneth said he was folding tee shirts until 2:00 A.M. 
But the post goes to press at midnight. 
Even if he somehow did bump into a reporter in the elevator, it would be too late. 
Well,you know, that guy's the worst. 
This should be the greatest night of my life, but I can't enjoy it. 
I mean,it's just k-k-killing me that somebody would say that about me. 
I'm sure the person who said it probably didn't mean it. 
And it was probably toofer. 
No,they meant it. 
They think I'm a moron, just like gilly and everyone else. 
Even gilly made fun of you? 
You know, it's funny,lemon. 
I g-guess I'll always b-b-b-be that kkkkkk kkkkk it was me! I did it! 
I--I didn't mean any of it. I'm 
sorry I said you could eat my poo. 
it was me. I did it. 
I know. 
I just wanted to get you to admit it. 
And you do know how you're gonna make this up to me,don't you? 
Oh,god. 
I've gotta write the deborah show. 
She wants to sing in every episode. 
You knew. How? 
No onion rings? Ugh,this 
place can eat my poo! 
You say that word a lot more than you realize. 
Now,I need you to initial here, and sign here and here. 
I've got to admit i never thought I'd get you. 
I mean,the stutter, the certificate,gilly. 
Yeah,well,I made up all that stuff about the extra baby foot too. 
I made that up--that was to make you feel better. 
I'll walk you out. 
Heel,toe,lemon. Heel,toe. 
proudly presents stick around. Coming up 
next we've got dog swap! 
proudly presents 30 Rock  Season02 Episode14 *******other ways of life, "it had to originate somewhere as a modus vivendi common to whole groups of man." 
Nothing? Hello? 
Hillary clinton is president,sir! 
I-I thought I would just try to scare you out of it. 
I-I need you to wake up. 
Sir,your son-in-law has taken over the company. 
He's installed your daughter as the ceo. 
Don't get me wrong. 
She's a wonderful girl. 
I've been stripped of all my responsibilities ******** ********* on 12. 
12! You've got to 
wake up-- please! 
 marcus schenkenberg was there. 
 who? 
Okay,the craziest thing happened this morning. 
I was home on my treadmill, and the phone rings, and you will not believe who it was. 
Liz? It's,uh,floyd. 
oh,my god, floyd called? 
You were using your treadmill? 
Yes. And,yes,pete. I use it every day. 
What did floyd want? 
He's in town.He was only 
supposed to be here for a day, but there's some big storm coming, and his flight on jetfun got cancelled. 
Jetfun--is that the one with the footbaths? 
Oh,no,that's airbike. 
They also have in-flight pornos and nbc news. 
Jetfun's the one that hands out fresh popcorn. 
Listen to me! 
Floyd wants to know if he can crash at my apartment so?What's the big deal? 
I haven't seen floyd since he left for cleveland. 
The last time I tried to get in touch with him, some rust-belt tramp answered the phone. 
And now he's here,and I don't know what crash means. 
I just don't wanna embarrass myself. 
I wanna be top dog for once instead of just... dog. 
Then you need to make him regret ever leaving. 
You need to pretend you're doing great. 
I am doing great. 
for once,I am not gonna be jan brady. 
I'm gonna be marcia, damn it. My nose! 
my bad! 
See? It's starting already! 
Look out,floyd. There is a new 
liz,and-- Ooh! Sandwich day. 
what's that? 
You've never heard of sandwich day? 
Why,it's the most wonderful day of all. 
Once a year, the teamsters go to this italian sandwich shop in brooklyn. 
No one knows what it's called or where it is. 
It's a teamster secret. 
But they buy us these sandwiches... 
oh,sus******** God bless us,every one! 
Well,I wish you the very best with the office,kathy. 
By the way, you know who hates unicorns? 
Wahlberg. 
Kathy geiss's office. 
please hold. 
Mr. Donaghy,you're not really 
going down to 12, are you? 
I have to. 
Of course it's humiliating. 
Banks is trying to shame me into leaving. 
But where else am I gna go? 
I've been sleeping with the cindy awford of corporations for the last 22 years what am I supposed to do, st l dowwi san what about washington? 
I'm sure your friends in the bush administration Bush? Has it gotten that bad? 
Good god,I'd rather work for an american car y than jon that sinking ship. 
 Made you this. 
 ****** Well... 
* I will remember you * * will you remember me * * Dooby-do,dooby-do don't let your life pass you by * Oh--hold it! 
Hey,jack. 
I got a company-wide email from the new ceo that was just a link to cats wearing bowties? 
Is everything okay? 
Everything's great. 
Yeah,I'm really... crushing it. 
Why you going to 12? 
12? Did I hit 12? I wanted,uh... 
40... 12, which is 52. Where I work. 
Business. 
I can't believe sandwich day is over! 
Hey,look. Lutz is still eating. 
you're savoring it? 
What,you think you're better than us? 
No,that's not it at all. 
Since my surgery, I have to eat slowly or my insides might explode. 
Gimme it! 
It's like knives! 
Look,z lemon's sach is still on her desk! 
Taking liz's foodot good. 
E'my aheese? 
But as far as liz lemon knows, her sandwich never came. 
U-uh,liz? 
Floyd,I didn't see you there. 
You look great. 
Do I? I'm pretty tired from 
playing as hard as I work. 
okay,now, bring up 23... 
and give me some air. 
My key. 
Thank you. Thank you 
so much for doing this. 
can I take you out to dinner tonight? 
You know,maybe we hit that barbecue place you puked at. 
You'll have to be more specific. 
Well,I'll see you back at... your place. 
Somebody get me ouof thidress******** you guys are working hard,for once. 
Where's my sandwich? 
Lutz made us do it! 
 No,it was frank! 
 It was jordan! 
stop it! 
This is all my fault, miss lemon, because I let it happen. 
And the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. 
please ask my permission before you quote me,kenneth. 
I don't know how... 
but you're gonna get me another sandwich, or I'm gonna cut your face up so bad, you'll have a chin. 
You'll all have chins! 
floor 12. 
door closing. 
It's me again,sir. 
I thought you'd like to know that it's snowing out, the city all silent and white. 
Wake up! 
Wake up! 
wow,snow in may. 
Thank you,global warming, for extreme,unpredictable weather patterns. 
There was actually a tornado in cleveland last week. 
Destroyed an entire city bck. 
Three bowling alleys, a liquor store, and the liquor store museum. 
So do you have time to grab dessert? 
Yikes! Did you know it is 4:30? 
I haven't stayed up this late since college. 
And behind this trap door, more orcs. 
That'll really piss off samir. 
My flight's in two hours. 
I'm sorry,I gotta go. 
You know,sometimes I really regret leaving new york. 
Like... right now, for instance. 
Well,what does new york have that cleveland doesn't have? 
I read that you guys are getting an ikea. 
Yeah. I'll believe it when I see it. 
Well,we've just been burned before. 
It was really great seeing you,liz. 
I'll see you. 
now,turn and look back at me. 
Atta boy. Eat it up,cleveland. 
Oh,god. Youths! 
I'm losing it,don. 
I mean,I been walking the streets in this crazy snow, trying to figure out who I am, where I fit in. 
I even stopped to catch a snowflake with my tongue, butly,that'sort of signal in C. 
Just give me a sign. 
I've given everything to this company, but now I feel that maybe I should... 
quit. 
You have to leave. 
What? 
Visiting hours were over some time ago. 
What happened to your voice? 
I was hit by lightning as a child. 
They made a movie about me. 
You have to leave ge. 
What did you say? 
Geriatric extended care. 
That's what... this wing 
of the hospital is called. 
I have to leave ge. 
after last night's freak snowfall, it's 90 and humid. 
In other global warming ws, a tornado t downtown detroit, putting out several fires. 
Hello? 
How did it go with floyd? 
The poor guy got lemoned. Hard. 
Started babbling about how he wished he'd never left new york. 
Did you do that thing I showed you? 
No,jenna,I did not come back from the bathroom and hand him my underwear. 
That's how I met that mobster. 
Next time floyd brings some corn pone tranny back to his apartment, all he's gonna be thinking about is me, standing there in the snow, looking like the one who got away. 
Crone! 
We'll get liz lemon her sandwich. 
An inational superstar. 
The teamsters will be honored that I'm even talking to them. 
* That old soft shoe * * is comin' around the bend * that's enough.That's 
enough. Now,you two--kiss. 
You with the sport coat, you're the girl. 
What are you doing? 
All we want is one more sandwich. 
Or just the name of the place now,why would we want ouecome public knowledge get ovn by a bunch of sissies? 
I know what driving the long haul's like. 
After my junior year at oberlin, we road-tripped to south by southwest! 
You lads got a lotta nerve. 
You gotta earn that information,girls. 
On our terms. In competition. 
 Bible trivia? 
 Drinking contest. 
Here. Tonight. 
Uh,a band-aid just fell out of your hair. 
Well... this is fun. 
You're back! What happened? 
Good morning. I'm checking in 
for flight 1876 to cleveland. 
Oh,no,no. We're cancelled. 
Cancelled? You gotta be kidding me! 
Oh,I would have checked my flight,but oh,no,no.The airline is cancelled. 
We're not an airline anymore. 
Wait,wait,wait. One 
storm? That's all it takes? 
We're still gonna make popcorn. 
Just no more airplanes. I'm sorry. 
Hey,karen. I hate your guts. 
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. 
You know, my cell was dead 'cause I didn't bring my charger. 
Who was that bitch that answered your phone eight months ago? 
So this girl, what's her lower back tattoo? 
A chinese character that she thinks means peace, but it really means "I have chlamydia"? 
Oh,my god,liz,I'm so glad you're bringing this up. 
Really? You are? 
Yeah,I-I feel bad how we never got to talk about it, and I didn't bring it up last night because we were having so much fun, and I didn't want to ruin it. 
Okay,well okay. 
I-I've been thinking about this a lot, and it's just-- oh,shoot. Hold on. I'm sorry. 
I got a flight. In 40 minutes. 
No,no,no,no. This is more important than me getting 
home or my partner meeting with peter venkman. 
No,don't do that. Just 
go. But you call me. 
I will. I-I will. 
O-or you could ride to the airport with me. 
No,it's okay. You go,and we'll talk. 
Okay. And I thought you 
were cool last night. 
I do rock. 
A drinking contest? 
What am I,12 and at my boyfriend's frat party? 
We need you,jenna! 
Lutz can't drink because of his operation, kenneth doesn't drink. 
Drinking's against my beliefs. 
Like gambling or freeway driving. 
And I can't drink--I still got my hollywood sock on. 
And I can't have booze because I'm on antibiotics after having some skanky club sex. 
He's on antibiotics because he lost his lucky penny and assumed it fell in his ear again. 
Shut up,lutz. 
Your surgery was for an undescended testicle. 
Wrong again! It was for 
two undescended testicles! 
Okay,wait,so no one else is drinking against the teamsters? It's only me? 
I'll do it. But only for the attention. 
Yes! 
 Is lemon around? 
 I haven't seen her, sir. 
Tell her I need her. I'll 
be on 12 the rest of the day. 
That's a joke. 
Hey,can you make the teamsters tell us where they get those sandwiches? 
Only if you beat them in a drinking contest. 
It's in their contract. 
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover I'm a child, I'm a mother! 
Floyd? 
Oh,boy. Oh,no! 
Why aren't you at the airport,floyd? 
There was no flight, was there? 
Not at the time,no. 
But I do have one tonight,so... 
you lied to me. 
I just didn't want to talk about that stuff. 
Can't we just fast-foward to being friends again? You know 
Your cell phone was dead! 
You faked that email! 
Peter venkman! That's 
from ghost busters! 
You used ghost busters for evil! 
I'm glad we didn't talk about that girl, because you're a liar! 
Okay. Okay,fine, you want some honesty? 
I don't know what girl u're talking about,liz. 
I'm single. I'm a 
lawyer. I wear ne coats. 
I'm the michael clayton of cleveland. 
Well,I hope your car blows up! 
Look,you made a choice! 
I asked you to come to cleveland with me, you nut job! 
I'll move to cleveland when you get that ikea-- never! 
Oh,you-- don't you deprive the good people of cleveland an ikea! 
You are vindictive, liz lemon! 
Smooth. 
Oh,come on,you guys. 
You guys do one. 
I've had ten shots. 
You've only had five shots. 
No,today. I've had ten shots today. 
You fought a hell of a good fight,blondie. 
But you can't win. 
We failed. 
I found my lucky penny. 
It's not in my ear. 
battery's dead. 
I got a half hour before they track me down. 
Alcohol? This smells just 
like hill people milk. 
I been drinking this since I was a baby! 
 It's on,y'all. 
 Yeah! 
Oh,boy. 
How'd they do that? 
* I'll be here in sunshine * * or in shadow * * oh,danny boy...* 
so should I ask why you're showing up for work at 6:30? 
I'm not gonna lie to you,jack. 
I was... working from home. 
Lemon,we should talk. 
Fine. Floyd was in 
town, and it was awful. 
And it started out great, and then it was awful, and now it's over. 
What happened? 
He lied about going to the airport. 
And? 
And I said I hope he dies in a car explosion. 
Lemon,life is about minimizing regrets. 
You never know when someone's going to slip into a coma and leave you regretting all the things you didn't say or get in writing from the company's lawyers. 
What I'm trying to say is you're...young, 
and you still haven't blown it completely. 
So don'T... start now. 
I hate going to the airport. 
Floyd. Floyd! Sorry. 
I need the cheapest ticket you have going anywhere. 
What's that in your bag? 
Uh,a sandwich and dipping sauce. 
That's more than 3 ounces. 
You can't bring that past here. 
Really? 
No,look,I just need to catch up with this guy before he gets on a plane to cleveland. 
That's sort of a cliche. 
You're sort of a cliche. 
One-way ticket to montreal. 
Crazy eyes. I should detain you. 
Look,please,I just need to talk to him before he takes off and I never get the chance again. 
Fine. Just leave the 
sandwich and go through. 
Leave the sandwich? 
 Leave the sandwich. 
 Boarding call for flight 254 to cleveland. 
You're choosing a sandwich over a guy. 
 That is less cliched. 
 I can do it! 
I can have it all! 
God,lady, you're eating foil! 
Floyd. Floyd! 
Liz. What are you doing here? 
I don't want your car to explode, and I don't want you to go into a coma. 
And I don't want to stab you in the face with a giant fork. 
What? 
Oh,that's not you. I've been 
threatening a lot of people lately. 
Look,liz,I'm really sorry about what happened,you know. 
Are we at the part where we just become friends again? 
I-I came to the airport, didn't I? 
And I wolfed my teamsters sub for you. 
Wait. No. Is that a saying? 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Final boarding call for flight 254... 
I gotta go. 
Oh,I-I still have your key. 
You should keep it. I mean,if 
you want to. You never know. 
Yeah,yeah,yeah. Yeah,you never know. 
I'll see you around, liz lemon.

Are you looking at porn? 
I know a good site that's dirty without sacrificing story. 
It's by women for women. 
No, I'm looking at real estate. 
Jack got it into my head that I should buy something. 
You don't own any property? 
No. Do you? 
I own my place here. 
My condo in clearwater. 
And I bought some land in the ninth ward after katrina. 
I'm leasing it back to the government as a prison. Ka-ching! 
I gotta get my act together. 
Even frank owns that chicken ranch in nevada. 
He thought he was buying a whorehouse. 
Look, if you're serious, I do have a lead. 
My business manager says he needs cash fast,  so he's selling his apartment. 
It's gorgeous. 
Okay, I'll check it out. 
Oh, you're gonna love it. 
Oh, if you're interested, A.J.'S also selling

Industry castrates art.

I can't watch any more of these german sitcoms! 
Try a game show. 
Hello. 
I got your message. 
I really can't come up tonight. 
I got a mountain of work to do. 
Look, the president is only going to veto your crazy social programs. 
The founding fathers never intended for the poor to live into their 40s. 
Jack... 
I know it's my turn, but I'm swamped with this deutschetelewelt stuff. 
If this is gonna work, we gotta meet each other halfway. 
Are you ready to play? 
Interrogation bear! 
Now-To Buy Your First Apartment Lemon, you speak german, right? 
I do. 
I spent my junior year abroad in frankfurt. 
I partied so hard over there, it was cr-azy. 
So many different types of sparrows! 
Well, I have to, um... 
delegate some important work to you. 
As part of the due diligence for the dtw deal,  I need you to watch th television shows and tell me what you think. 
Thank you. 
C.C.And I are trying to meet halfway, which 
means balancing work and love and life. 
I honestly don't know how kelly ripa does it. 
Look at us--you and C.C.Are meeting halfway. 
I'm going to see an apartment later. 
And the community center is going to stage my play. 
 I have thing that night. 
 I have a thing that night. 
Mr.Jordan, I cannot work 
with that machine at my desk. 
But you can have coffee anytime you want. 
I don't drink coffee, sir. 
I don't drink hot liquids of any kind. 
That's the devil's temperature. 
Ken, this is new york, the big easy. 
Live a little! 
Boundaries are made to be tested. 
That's why my wife and i stopped using a "safe word." 
But I don't wanna do anything I'll regret. 
Regrets are for horseshoes and handbags. 
Oh, my! 
How was the apartment? 
It was... incredible. 
river views. New kitchens. 
Party perfect. The windmere. 
An oasis from the vile obscenity ondition. 
I made an offer, and they accepted! 
 What? 
 I know, it's crazy. 
I guess i have to get a loan. 
Call A.J.But ask for "mike." 
I can't believe you bought an apartment. 
Well, not yet. 
I still have to get approved by the co-op board. 
I'm all nervous. 
I have to dress up and smile and try to get them to like me. 
It's gonna be like going on a blind date. 
Oh, no, it's so much better. 
'Cause an apartment never waits till you get in the shower then steals the necklace your mother gave you. 
the windmere: If you lived here, you'd be home now! 
Hey, slow down there, ken. 
Coffee is not like alcohol. 
It's pretty addictive. 
I love how it makes me feel. 
It's like my heart is trying to hug my brain. 
You know what we've never done, grizz? 
Fight each other! 
Easy, ken. 
You guys are my best friends. 
Jack, what the hell is this? 
Why are we meeting here? 
You said you wanted me to meet you halfway,  and this betting parlor in the pennsylvania coal mining country is exactly half the distance between my office and yours. 
It's our special place. 
Well, technically, that corner is exactly halfway, but I'm not going over there. 
All my life, work came first. 
I missed so many weddings, funerals, karate demonstrations. 
Birthdays, lilith fairs. 
But not anymore. 
You're my new night job. 
And I'm gonna love you like my boss is watching. 
Say, what do you think they do for fun around here? 
Smack around nosy out-of-towners. 
Also, we have a lovely doll museum. 
Gladys knight to the stage, please, gladys knight hey, kenneth, I need to watch these dvds, but I haveery important meeting. 
That's great! 
Now, I've heard you speaking german to some of your tours. 
Oh, yes, sir. 
If you're not reading the bible in german,  you're not getting the real versteckte bedeutung of it. 
 Okay, well, this is very important. 
 You are. 
 I need you to watch these shows... 
 watchy, watchy. 
And write a summary of each one. 
It's for mr. Donaghy, and it 
has to be done by tomorrow. 
And I am delegating it to you. 
Your last name is weird. 
Are you okay? 
Who wants coffee? 
let's do it. 
Let's move here. We'll get 
a little cabin in the woods. 
I'll plant heirloom tomatoes. 
We'll ride our bikes into town. 
I'll grow a beard. 
People from my old life will pass through town. 
They won't even recognize me. 
They'll just say, "thanks, pap, " and then they'll buy some of my cider. 
The real world calling. 
Oh, my god! 
I'm in looooove! 
God, I wish this town weren't halfway between d.C.And new york. 
And I don't know why i lied to you guys about having read that book. 
I'm just nervous. 
Anyway, I didn't read the lovely bones. 
This is empty. 
So... we have so much in common. 
we're all white. 
Funny story. 
I was on a plane once with brett favre's cousin it says here...that you still 
have an outstanding student loan? 
Yes. It is outstanding. 
No. I can explain that. 
The theater program at my school lost its accreditation,  so I thought I didn't have to pay for it anymore. 
Look, I didn't think i was ready for this, but I am. 
There's this... connection 
that I feel to the apartment. 
And I am a great neighbor. 
Just ask anyone in my building. 
Except raheem. 
I turned him in to homeland security. By accident. 
I love your building. There. 
I said it. Love. 
There's, uh... something 
coming out of your nose. 
You missed gladys knight's sound check. 
Did you know they replace the ps every five years, just like menudo? 
Oh, hey, how did the meeting with the co-op board go? 
Good. Bad. 
Really bad. But good. 
They said they were gonna let me know. 
 Should I call them? 
 No. 
You have to wait fothem to call you. 
Yes. I'm going to play it cool. 
That's what homeowners do. 
Act like adults. Playing it cool. 
The germans are here! 
I am going through something right now! 
They're a day early. 
Jack went to see C.C., And he hasn't come 
back yet, and he's not answering his phone. 
What? He's not? 
This deal has to go through. 
Then jack will be ceo, and I will be king of the assistants! 
Please put on some decent clothes and go talk to them. 
You're the only one who's seen all their shows. 
Where's kenneth? 
Gentlemen Mr.Donaghy is not in the positions 
to worry himself this occurrence But your bussiness makings are much importance to his heart Return Germany... 
Tell the... 
Time... 
Hubcap(?) 
I think they're gonna walk. 
Super. 
What happened? 
I just bought a german television studio. 
That's what I call a country breakfast. 
Although I've never been to a place before where they kill the pig in front of you. 
It's so quaint. 
It's strange we didn't get any ham. 
Morning shift change at the mine. 
Oh, boy. 
We'd better get back to work too. 
Oh, yeah, right. 
God, I haven't thought about work once this whole time. 
I know. It's weird. 
Good weird or last night weird? 
Good weird. 
I'll see you tomorrow. 
love... a urine mirage 
in a desert of fear. 
What's happening? Where 
are they taking her? 
I'm getting rid of the machine, ken, for your own good. 
No. No, please, don't do that.Come on! 
I'll make you feel good. 
Get a grip! Look at yourself! 
What's happened to me? 
You rode the brown serpent. 
But the important thing is you survived, ken. 
No. 
I made two promises to my mother before i left for new york. 
One, if I found any mackenzies living up here, I would kill them. 
And two, I would not let this city change me. 
So you had a little bender. 
It's not just the coffee. 
I also went to a pg-13 movie. 
I-I bought a pair of sunglasses. 
I tried a jewish doughnut. 
I'd always been told that new york wasthe 21st centu. 
And look what's happened. 
I've become one of them. 
I've been sodomized. 
Hey, it's liz lemon. 
This message is for the co-op board, I guess. 
This is the number you gave me. 
I hope it's not fake. 
'Cause you accepted my bid, and I haven't heard from you. 
But I'm doing great. 
I bought a german television studio today. 
Does everyone know that you're a bunch of liars, or should I tell them myself? 
Because I know a lot of people. 
You know what? I'm fine. 
Because I know who I am. 
You--I feel sorry for you, co-op board. 
I am going to the hospital, and I hope you're happy! 
I'm just... confused. 
It seems weird to me that you would still be advertising the apartment after you accepted my offer. 
And I am here to remind you And you know what? I've moved on. 
I bought a whole bunch of apartments. 
I bought a black apartment. So... 
Yes, sir, but I think if you Lemon, how do you say "buy" and "sell" in german? 
Verkaufen and kaufen. 
So close. 
Other way around. 
Oh, yeah. I always got confused by that. 
SALE OF NBC TO GERMAN FIRM RUMORED Blurgh! 
Yes. Blurgh. 
 But it's a misunderstanding.  Perfect 
I'll just tell don geiss that I let a subordinate with an unaccredited theater tech degree do a billion-dollar handshake deal while my girlfriend and i showered together at a red roof inn. 
Hockassin is for lovers oh, boy, I'm sorry. 
No, lemon, it's my fault. Lied to you. 
About what? 
All this time i've been telling you that we can have it all-- success and happiness. 
The big office and true love. 
 Waitwe can't? - No. 
Because they both require everything of you. You have to choose. 
So which are you gonna choose? 
Uh, excuse me. 
Could you turn off the race announcer and put on some gladys knight? 
And what is the champagne situation here? 
Okay, thank you. 
What are you still doing in washington? 
I can't come to hockassin, jack. 
I'm afraid if I see you, I'll change my mind. 
Change your mind about what? 
When I was with you the other day,  I missed the vote on a bill to legalize recreational whale torture We only have one speed, jack. 
That's what I love about us. 
The drive, the ambition. 
Our belief that sex is a competition. 
It's what we have in common. 
And it's why it's impossible to pull this off. 
No, no, no, you're wrong. It is possible. 
I know we can't do all of this at full speed. 
We have to choose. And I choose you. 
 Oh, jack. 
 Oh, come on. 
Get in that ridiculous electric car of yours and get up here. 
Look, we are both at a place in our lives right now where we can't really spend this time When I was a kid, I was raised in a pretty religious household, and I remember the one time... 
You know, I think it goes back to my mother's mother. 
She was in a loveless marriage for 40 years... 
Yes, sir. 
I agree. 
Well, if we look at the larger trend well, I'll have it for you first thing in the morning. 
Thank you. 
Children, so... do you agree or not? 
Oh, boy, uh... 
when you think about it, there's really... no answer. 
Did you take another call while I was talking? 
Yes, but never forgetting that you were on the other line. 
For whatever it's worth, C.C., I do love you. 
Me too. 
But we can't do this. 
Maybe in another life we'll get it right. 
Sure. In another life. 
Thanks, pal. 
Mr.Jordan, I just wanted to thank you 
for everything that you've done for me. 
It's been an honor being your friend and learning about the non-reproductive aspects of human sexuality from you. 
But this is good-bye. 
I let my mama down, and I'm going back to georgia. 
What? 
No, you can't leave, ken! 
Who's gonna help me tell white people apart? 
And what about our tickets to spamalot? 
And who'll be my wingman at speed dating? 
Oh, grizz, I'll miss you most of all. 
New york, mm proved too much for the man too much for the man he couldn't make it . 
so he's leaving the life he's come to know he's leavin' leavin' on that midnight train to georgia leavin' on a midnight train well, well liz The board. 
You look... good. 
Thank you. So do you.

If you blow out the kitchen wall, you can make a very nice breakfast nook. 
Yes, he's leavin' yes, he's leav-iiiin' on a midnight train to georgia leavin' on a midnight train and you shouldn't torture whales. 
I'm sorry about C.C. 
Thanks, lemon. 
Wanna get drunk? 
No. There's too many phones in here. 
You should have gone for it, you know? 
You made the same choice that C.C.And I did. 
You chose your career over floyd. 
My world her world his world, our world mine and his alone I've got to go,  I've got to go on that midnight train all aboard get aboard all aboard get aboard all aboard on that midnight train I missed it he missed it I missed that midnight train to georgia he missed that midnight train whoo whoo there's an 11:45 and I was misinformed about the time misinformed about the time didn't even get to stand in line yeah, I missed it he missed the midnight train to geor-gia hello. I'm trying to take a nap. 
What's going on out here? 
Nothing, gladys knight. 
Sorry. 
Sorry, everyone. 
One day, sir, this whole city will be yours. 
Oh, hey, can I talk to you? 
You always ruin everything. 
I have to apologize for him. 
He's been a bit tense since we found that I'm up for the GE chairmanship. 
Yeah, that's why I'm here. 
I got a call from some lawyer today who was asking me what kind of boss you are and how long I've known you and what animal best describes you. 
What did you say? 
An eagle with the head of a bear. 
Thank you. Your respect 
means the world to me, Lemon. 
I can't believe it's starting already. 
What is? 
GE is vetting me. 
They're trying to see if I have any skeletons in my closet. 
It's what they do with all the presidential candidates. 
Do you think they'll find anything? 
Oh, yeah. 
I've done some things, Lemon. 
That's why I hired a private investigator to look into my own background. 
He'll spot any red flags before GE does, and that way I should be able to stay ahead of this. 
Wait. You hired someone 
to investigate yourself. 
That's weird. 
Well, you do the same thing with your therapist every week, don't you? 
I had an amazing breakthrough with my therapist this week. 
I was talking about... 
Ring, ring! 
...that dream that I have 
all the time... 
Hello. 
I'm sorry. 
I have to take this. 
Yes. 
Well, she's right here. 
Fake phone. 
She'll be right down. 
What else is going on? 
What's going on in here? 
You're on time for work. 
The woman in your dressing room is your wife. 
Sorry, Angie. 
I let Tracy back in my life on two conditions. 
One... this. 
Bling-bling, That is ghetto fabulous! 
This belonged to Brooke Astor. 
It's very nice. 
And the other condition... 
I'm with him all the time. 
All he gets to do is work, eat, love on me, and sleep. 
Isn't that right, baby? 
I'm whipped! 
Angie got me up at 7:30 today. 
Did you know in the morning they have food, TV, almost everything? 
It's pretty good. 
I did know that. 
Yeah. 
Liz, I need your help. 
I can't do this alone. 
Tracy's like a horny child. 
He needs constant adult supervision. 
Will you help me out when I'm not here? 
If it keeps him like this, yes. 
Will you be able to do that without falling in love? 
Also yes. 
I think this is gonna be great, Angie. 
I think you and me are gonna make a great team. 
Oh, you looking for a sassy black friend? 
Oh, no, I didn't... 
Well, you got one now, girlfriend. 
Go on! 
Miss Maroney, here's today's fan mail. 
Are there any from prisons? 
Are there? 
Federal! 
God! 
Putting on this weight is the best thing that ever happened to me. 
People actually like me now. 
There she is. 
There's my star. 
And to think I wanted you to lose this weight. 
It sounds so crazy now. 
I know. 
Oh, and I saw your Enorme commercial. It's fabulous. 
What's Enorme? 
It's the number-one fragrance for plus-sized women. 
Grassisima? 
Balena? 
Enorme. 
Make him chase the chunk. 
Available exclusively at your local drug store. 
Do not use if menstruating. 
Can't plus-sized women wear regular perfume? 
Jenna, your career is really taking off now. 
And on a personal level, I just like you more when you're fat. 
Oh, thank you. 
It's all happening! 
Okay, let's shoot these promos. 
Can I get some makeup for Tracy, please? 
Hi, sweetheart. 
How are you? 
Hey. 
Oh, hell, no! 
Actually, he looks great. 
Thank you. 
You Lenny Wosniak? 
Thanks for meeting me here. 
Yeah, I get it. 
Discretion. 
I wouldn't want to talk about this in my office anyway. 
Yeah. 
Also, my gym is right over there. 
So, uh... 
how does this work? 
It's pretty simple, really. 
I'm gonna go through your life with a fine-tooth comb. 
The more information I have, the easier this is gonna be. 
Now, have you ever been arrested? 
I have. 
The 1976 Democratic National Convention. 
But it's okay. 
I was there beating up hippies. 
And what about your family? 
Any skeletons there? 
My brother Eddie sells faulty sprinkler systems to elementary schools. 
My cousin Tim fixes NBA games. 
My mother is an Olympic-level racist. 
But as for the rest, they're too drunk to do much of anything. 
Unless getting thrown out of a Chili's is a crime. 
Any weird sex stuff I should know about? 
You know what? 
Don't tell me. 
I like to find that out on my own. 
I'm a watcher. 
Okay, I'll get started on my end of the process. 
Is there anything else you want to tell me now? 
Nope. 
That's pretty much it. 
That's what they all say, Mr. Donaghy. 
I'll be in touch. 
Mm, one more thing. 
If I sign a friend up at my gym, I get a free hat, so... 
Think about it. 
I'm losing weight. 
What? 
Look at my belt. 
This is the notch I had to make last week. 
This is the notch I'm using now. 
I'm back to the factory-made notches. 
Jenna, calm down. 
No, I won't calm down. 
This can't be happening. 
Everything is based on the fat. 
Enorme, the offer to play Ms. PAC-MAN 
in the live-action Atari movie! 
What? 
And worst of all, Jack won't like me anymore. 
We have a secret ritual now where we slap our palms together when we walk by each other. 
A high five. 
It was our special thing. 
Hey, Liz Lemon. 
I've been reading the newspaper to come up with some ideas for some topical sketches. 
So, this week, can we do "Business Section"? 
Tracy, I love it that you're trying to help. 
Everything is great! 
Thanks to Angie. 
Word. 
Where is my lovely wife? 
She had to step out. 
She had a hair appointment. 
I'm going to a strip club now. 
What? No. 
I can't let you do that. 
I'm sorry, Liz. 
This is who I am. 
You can't ask a bird not to fly. 
You can't ask a fish not to swim, You can't ask a tiger not to turn back into a Chinese dude at midnight. 
Angie is gonna kill us. 
I feel bad about doing this to you, Liz Lemon. 
I really do. 
And the only way I can feel better about myself is to get booby-slapped by a coked-out Russian stripper. 
I'm out. 
Ugh! 
Is there something we need to discuss? 
No, Jack. 
Everything's great. 
Look... 
it's come to my attention that you no longer have an eating problem. 
That's ridiculous. 
Is it? 
You're not breathing heavily, your skin is cleared up. 
I even find you slightly attractive right now. 
Don't say that, Jack. 
Come on. 
"Me want food," right? 
Do you want food, Jenna? 
Do you? 
I don't know anymore. 
I have no appetite. 
It's okay. 
Kenneth. 
Kenneth here is gonna be with you 24-7 to keep you fat. 
Keep Jenna fat. 
Keep Jenna funny. 
Right, Kenneth? 
Lt'll be just like back home on the pig farm. 
I'll fatten you up, grow to love you, and then my uncles will slit your throat. 
What have you got for me, Len? 
Well, Mr. Donaghy, 
you're pretty clean. 
And your sex life checks out real nice. 
Thank you. 
There are a couple things, though, that could get in the way of this promotion. 
Like you should probably give up your membership to the all-white Woodvale Country Club. 
That is not an all-white club. 
What about Johnny Carlos? 
He's ethnic. 
He's the king of Spain, Jack. 
I don't think that counts. 
All right. 
I'll resign. 
Okay, you also have an undocumented domestic employee. 
Manuelo? 
No, I need Manuelo. 
I could never pay an English-speaking person that little. 
They'd starve. 
All right, I'll send him home. 
Well, that's it. 
Unless you think I missed something. 
No, I think you've been very thorough. 
It's been a pleasure doing business with you. 
Oh, Jack. 
One last thing. 
You don't have a massive collection of cookie jars, do you? 
How did you find out about that? 
Collector of the Year. 
Congratulations, Victor Nightingale. 
Thank you. 
Yes, I'm Victor Nightingale. 
This is bad. 
CEOs don't have thousands of cookie jars. 
Weird little guys in bow ties do. 
You hear what I'm getting at? 
What? 
You saying it's a gay thing? 
You wish it was a gay thing. 
This is worse. 
You got to get rid of them. 
No. 
I'm not doing that. 
I've already made enough sacrifices for this company. 
They're not gonna get this. 
This is Rudolph Giuliani in 1987 with his collection of antique wooden dolls. 
That's a fake. 
Giuliani doesn't collect dolls. 
Yeah, you're right. 
He doesn't. 
Because he incinerated them in 1989, the year he ran for mayor. 
He looks so happy. 
Aw, Jack, the choice is yours. 
You can either be the head of the largest corporation in America or get buried in a bow tie with a bunch of cookie jars. 
Liz Lemon, where's Tracy? 
He, uh, went to the vet. 
His cobra got sick. 
Okay. 
Hey, everybody. 
I'm back from doing whatever Liz Lemon said. 
And what was that, exactly? 
My cobra, Ramses. 
He got sick. 
So I took him to the vet. 
Then my thumb got caught in my butt so I nodded my head until it came out. 
Come here, you. 
You smell like Enorme and brass polish. 
You were at a strip club. 
It was all Liz Lemon's fault. 
The whole plan was hers. 
Aw, come on, man! 
Tracy Jordan, you are in for a world of hurt. 
But you're worse. 
I trusted you. 
You wear glasses. 
Your access to Tracy Jordan is cut off. 
You can't cut me off. 
This is my show. 
Not anymore. 
Everything goes through me now. 
Goodbye forever, Liz Lemon. 
Thank you for being my secretary! 
Normally, I would tell Tracy our sketch ideas. 
Okay. 
In the opening sketch this week, Tracy is a bank robber... 
No. 
I don't want to perpetuate any black stereotypes. 
Next. 
Okay, well, in this one, Tracy plays a gentleman who wears flamboyant clothes and lives uptown. 
He's a pimp. 
He's an entrepreneur. 
What's the character's name? 
Slickback Lamar. 
He's also playing Barack Obama. 
No. 
We support Kucinich. 
Listen, Angie, I'm sorry I lied, but you got to give me another chance. 
Excuse me. 
Did you just try to control my body with your white hand? 
Don't make me contact Reverend Sharpton. 
I can't deal with you. 
I want new writers for Tracy, or he doesn't do the show. 
Grizz, Dot Com, start coming up with ideas. 
We open on a lone soldier walking through the desert. 
The year... 1861. 
The place? 
Mars. 
This stuff will make you real fat, Miss Maroney. 
It made my Dad's heart just up and give out. 
And that's what made my Mom's friend Ron move in. 
Mmm. 
Mm-hmm! 
Coming in for a landing. 
Uh-oh. 
There's turbulence. 
And now an Indian guy got up to use the bathroom, and an air marshal shot him. 
Arrrrhh! 
No. No, I can't. 
Boy, I wish I had some pig sedative right now. 
Goodbye, cookie jars. 
Thank you for taking care of this for me. 
No problem, Mr. Donaghy. 
This is for the best. 
No more secrets. 
Nothing standing in my way now. 
But just out of curiosity, what exactly are you going to do with all of these? 
They'll be taken to Jersey City and incinerated. 
No. 
No, no, no, no. 
I can't have that. 
Give that to me. 
It's your funeral, Donaghy. 
I can't destroy them. 
I'll give them to someone. 
A fellow ceramiphile. 
You're like John Kerry with his windsurfing. 
I warned him, too. 
How'd it go with Angie? 
Terrible. She hates me. 
She's hijacking the show. 
I got to talk to Jack. 
You want a scary black lady to be nice to you, tell her you like her nails. 
Always works for me at the bank. 
Miss Lemon, may I speak with you? 
Sure. 
Can you walk and talk? 
Usually, but now you got me thinking about it. 
Jenna with problem I have. 
There it is. 
I'm supposed to be helping Miss Maroney stay fat, but it's not working. 
How do I get her to eat? 
Well, a lot of women overeat because they feel bad about themselves. 
Maybe that's the problem. 
Everything's going so well for Miss Maroney right now. 
Yeah, so be mean to her. 
Women with low self-esteem take refuge in either food or sex. 
Not me, of course. 
Hi. I just wanted to meet you, 
Mr. Mason. I'm a really big fan. 
Who picked out your outfit? 
Stevie Wonder? 
Hey! Hey! Hey! 
Nice man! 
So you got to be mean, Kenneth. 
I guess I could wait for her to drop something and then say, "Smooth move, ex-lax." 
That's what my mom's friend Ron would do. 
Oh, brother. 
All right, Jenna really wants this, huh? 
Her career depends on it. 
Please help. 
Okay, do you have something to write on? 
Oh, I got one. 
Sir, someone else called about purchasing your collection. 
A Mr. Gary Heingarten? 
No. 
Jonathan, he lives in Albany. 
The temperature fluctuations alone would... 
These things expand and contract. 
They're alive, Jonathan. 
Hey, do you have a minute? 
Tracy's wife is... 
What's with the cookie jar? 
I collect them. 
Really? Is that some sort of 
unresolved childhood thing? 
Nice try. 
We never had any cookie jars in my home because our mother never baked us any cookies 'cause she never felt we deserved any cookies. 
So, obviously, it has nothing to do with my childhood. 
But that cookie jar says "Mom" on it. 
Uh, I don't think so. 
I've always viewed it as an upside-down "Wow." 
But it doesn't matter now because I have to, um... 
...get rid of them all. 
Why? 
Because the guy with the weird hobby never gets the corner office. 
Lemon, what is going on on your stage right now? 
Oh. This is what I came 
to talk to you about. 
Tracy's wife is out of control. 
Did you tell her you like her fingernails? 
No. 
But I thought that we could give her a consultant credit. 
It's meaningless, but it might calm her down. 
Lemon, I'm impressed. 
You're beginning to think like a businessman. 
A businesswoman. 
I don't think that's a word. 
Unfortunately, what you've gotten yourself into is not a business situation, but a family conflict. 
So it's tricky. 
So what do I do about Angie? 
I think you're gonna have to fight her. 
What? 
Yeah. 
You throw her out, she'll probably punch you in the face. 
Then we eject her from the building, and we bar her for life. 
I think Angie's right-handed, so you have to work her clockwise. 
You've already thought about fighting her? 
Every time I meet a person, I figure how I'm gonna fight them. 
You have a gimpy left knee, right? 
I'm not gonna fight anybody. 
I'm gonna give her the title, and she'll back off. 
Lemon, you're gonna get hit in the face, and it's gonna hurt like hell. 
You want to lean in to take away their momentum. 
Hands up. 
Come on. 
I don't want to. 
Lean in. Come on. 
Oh, God. 
Stop it! 
Hello, Jenna. 
Still failing at overeating just like you fail at everything in your life? 
What? 
You quitter. 
You gonna quit this like you quit fashion school? 
Give up like you gave up on your relationship with David Blaine? 
He's the one who drove the wedge... 
with his magic. 
Also, you've got so many daddy issues, the only thing keeping you from being a stripper is your weird mole. 
Kenneth. 
That's very hurtful. 
You lied about your brother drowning so people would come to your one-woman show. 
Kenneth, I've never heard you talk this way. 
Your toes look like dried-up shrimps. 
Oh. 
Oh, daddy. 
Go on. 
Keep talking. 
What else don't you like about me? 
Can I help you? 
Yes. 
Angie, I know you and I got off on the wrong foot here, but I want you to know that I appreciate your contribution to the show, and so I want to offer you a consultant credit. 
I don't want that crap title. 
You think you're gonna buy me off so I'll play nice? 
It's never gonna happen. 
Okay. 
I'm ordering you to leave. 
Excuse me? 
Get your stuff and get out. 
Don't make me say it again. 
No, Liz Lemon, don't do it. 
Are you steppin' up on me? 
So what if I am? 
Also, your nails look tacky. 
Oh, wait a minute! 
Enough, damn it! 
Enough! 
Do I have to fix this situation? 
I am the immature one. 
But the both of you, you're forcing me to act like an adult. 
An adult! 
And even worse, you're making me stop two ladies from going at it. 
But I don't care. 
'Cause I'm putting my foot down. 
You're putting your foot down with me? 
Uh-huh. 
Baby, you got to go. 
You're controlling, you're manipulative, you're loud... 
Tracy, I've never heard you talk like that before. 
Hey, let me get this shirt off. 
Get it off. 
Okay, so, just to be clear, does this mean Angie is leaving or... 
Oh, no! 
You guys start with that?! 
That... wow! 
That is... 
Mr. Donaghy? 
I've got some bad news. 
I wasn't able to get Miss Maroney to eat. 
I'm so sorry. 
What happened? 
Well, It turns out she's the wrong kind of crazy, and I guess we have to get married now. 
Apology accepted, Kenneth. 
I suppose we're both having a pretty bad day. 
Ha! 
Look at that kooky old cookie jar. 
I like the upside-down "Wow" on it. 
You like cookie jars, Kenneth? 
Well, I guess I've never thought about it that much. 
We had a nice one back home in Georgia. 
Had a bear on it. 
I remember when my Mom's friend Ron would come over. 
They'd go into the bedroom to sort out their paperwork, and I'd just go ahead and stare at that cookie jar. 
It was almost as if I took every problem that I ever had and I put it inside that cookie jar. 
And I sealed it up so tight, that nothing would never, ever, ever get out. 
So, I guess to answer your question, I'd give cookie jars about a "B." 
Some people have so many problems that there aren't enough cookie jars in the world to contain them. 
Well, that just makes me sad. 
Kenneth, I have a cookie-jar collection. 
Would you like to have it? 
Of course, sir! 
I'd love to! 
Always hold them squarely at the base, never by the lid. 
And should you ever go to the convention in Sarasota, please tell Patty and Beth and all of them that Vic Nightingale says hello. 
Okay, sir. 
Are you happy now, you son of a bitch? 
You son of a bitch. 
Grassisima? 
Balena? 
Grassota? 
Ooh? 
Enorme? 
Enorme? 
Como ti amo? 
Porcella? 
Oh, are you sure this is a good idea? 
What if someone sees us? 
Don't worry, it's too early for the creative types. 
And I sent my assistant to a nonexistent italian bakery out in queens. 
This is the address he gave me. 
He never makes mistakes. 
I can't go back there without sfogliatelle! 
We can't keep sneaking around, jack. 
It's too dangerous. 
I'm trying to get the united states government to sue your parent company. 
 Take off your pantsuit. 
 Right back at ya. 
Workplace! 
lemon, you're here early. 
Well, I gave up caffeine, so I've been going to bed at 5:30. 
But I will leave now. 
oh, don't be silly. 
Uh, liz lemon, I'd like you to meet a business associate of mine. 
Uh, lakeesha.. gurez..arafat. 
I like your necklace. 
Oh, thanks. It's actually a rape whistle. 
But the whistle part fell off,  and I just liked how it looked, so I.. Kept it. 
I will leave you to it. 
It being business. 
Of course. 
I call the movie risky business risky "it" because "it" means business. 
Lemon out. 
proudly presents 30 Rock Season02 Episode08 *******lunch *******work Not now*** And******you... 
******time is******kids Kids wait*****here ***** Take that off. You didn't go to harvard. 
I went to harvard. 
I did standup there this weekend. 
Very funny. 
You were not graduated from that institution. 
Well, I got a squeezer from an indian girl on a bunk bed. 
So I think I got the full harvard experience. 
That does sound pretty accurate. 
You're just trying to get a rise out of me, sir. 
And you do not wanna make a harvard man angry. 
 Lemon. 
 Hey, jack.What's up? 
That woman you met this morning in my office is not a colleague of mine. 
We are lovers. 
That word bums me out unless it's between the words meat and pizza. 
Her name is C.C., Which 
stands for celeste cunningham. 
Wait! Isn't she that 
congresswoman that's trying to destroy this company for allegedly turning some children orange. 
Yes. And therein lies the dilemma. 
This corporation has a vy strict bros before hos policy. 
So you must really have some serious feelings for her. 
Okay, if I can't say lovers, you can't say feelings. 
But, yes, it is serious. 
And, in spite of everything, I want her to meet some of my friends. 
So I'm going to hold a dinner party, and I would like you to come. 
Oh, that's very nice. Thank you, jack. 
I just want you to be discreet. 
And try not to dress like a small-town lesbian. 
Well, lemon, that was a good chat. 
Good luck with that, uh, alopecia problem of yours. 
Aw, come on! 
I don't have that. 
Very hairy. 
hey, you guys, sorry I'm late. 
I'll take one of those. Sorry. 
Hey, guys, good news. 
We won an award. 
We did? 
Well, I did. 
Do you remember when I filmed that movie version of the mystic pizza musical? 
Do I! I don'T. 
Well, the ny city critics association just sent me this "best actress in a movie based on a musical based on a movie." 
Hey, that's great! 
okay, enough! 
How long are we gonna talk about this stupid award? 
We have more important things to worry about,  like where are the french fries i did not ask for? 
You guys need to anticipate me! 
Okay, forget it. 
I can't rehearse today. 
it's gonna be one of those weeks. 
Oh, no, I talked to him last time when he wanted to change his name to wise greasy bastard. 
Fine. 
Oh, monsters, why did I create you? 
Okay, tracy. What's wrong? 
It's not fair, liz lemon. 
Everybody wins awards but me. 
Even shaquille o'neal got a kid's choice award for that animated movie we did. 
boy, I hope we rescue the starfish king on this adventure. 
It'll be a slam dunk. 
Would you call what we did last night sex? 
I spent two days making that movie for my homey. 
What did I get? 
A million dollars, a yellow bentley, and nothing. 
I never win anything. 
Look at this coffee cup my kids got me for father's day. 
I'm a failure, liz lemon. 
Maybe I should just give up and try this crystal meth i've been hearing so much about. 
No, no, no! You don't have to do that. 
You won an award! 
Did I not tell you? 
 Come on, lemon. 
 Yes! 
You are getting.. A.. 
lifetime achievement award from the.. 
pacific rim emmys. 
Pacific rim? 
I love the pacific rim. 
I spent nine months in japan shooting samurai I am-urari. 
I fell in love with their culture, especially sharking. 
What's sharking? 
It's when you run up on a lady on the streets and pull her tube top down while your friend videotapes it. 
It's considered a crime here. 
Thanks a lot, puritans. 
Right. So are you ready 
to hit some rehearsal? 
Hell, yeah! 
I do not want to disappoint my japanese public. 
Especially godzilla. 
I'm just kidding. 
I know he doesn't care what humans do. 
All right, I'll see you out there, winner. 
He's fine. 
I just need you to make him a pacific rim emmy. 
Props has an old basketball trophy we could solder some wings onto. 
I love it. 
It is unbelievable the lengths you go to to keep that guy happy. 
I know. 
I don't get that kind of treatment. 
I don't have to treat you that way, because you're the sane one you're my rock. 
It is amazing how grounded i've been able to stay despite my celebri-tay. 
'Sup, dude? 
I went to harvard. 
I lived in lowell house and was a member of the signet society. 
If you were actually a member of the signet society, you would be wearing this pin. 
You mean.. this pin? 
Your lame thing is on his pants. 
Hey, liz lemon, when am I leaving for japan? 
'Cause I have to arrange for a snake nanny. 
Oh, I didn't think you were actually gonna go to japan. 
I mean, the award ceremony is tonight, so I told them to mail it to you. 
No! 
I told my kids they could come see their dad get an award. 
So it has to at least be live via satellite. 
Ah, yeah, but it's a really big time difference. 
It'll be like 4:00 in the morning here. 
Perfect! Just when I get 
back from maiden voyage,  newark's first offshore gentleman's barge. 
I'm gonna get the kids, and we coming straight here. 
okay. I'll.. 
set that up. 
Really? You're gonna do that? 
Liz lemon know who keeps the lights on around here. 
But I couldn't do it without my background players. 
That's why I want you and josh to be there for my award. 
And then afterwards, maybe I let you hold it. 
Then you can check out my award. 
Banter! 
I'm sorry. 
He's an idiot. 
No, don't blame him. 
You're the one who rewards his bad behavior. 
U give him anything he wants. 
Me, I can't even get a real exterminator to get that squirrel out of my dressing room. 
no. 
No, don't move like that. 
Good evening. 
Y I take your coat? 
Uh, yes, thank you. 
I'm sorry I'm late. 
The other guests have already arrived and are in the dining room. 
 Oh, hipyz. 
 Lemon! 
Is this.. ev? 
Well, we had a longer invite list, but we thought, for the sake of discretion we had to eliminate anybody with any influence or connectio or stature,  so that pretty much left you. 
And then we added kenneth so you would have somebody to talk to. 
"What's your favorite pizza topping?" 
Mine's plain. But I like others. 
I have to say. 
You are the most beautiful woman in this room right now. 
Liz, "tell me a painful story about your teenage years." 
 Okay, let's fake this candle. 
 Okay. 
okay, tracy, they are ready for your acceptance speech in 3, 2, 1. 
People of pacific rim, how you feel? 
All right! 
I'd like to thank my wife, my two sons, tracy jr., And george foreman,  
this josh dude, liz lemon, uh.. 
baldheaded pete for setting up the satellite,  and of course, a very special blonde lady. 
Shelly long, you're truly an inspiration to me! I know that! 
And finally, I'd like to thank you, pacific rimmers,  for all that you've given us. 
Karaoke, karate, and most of all.. 
wanizame atakku! 
Shark attack! 
Okay, so you got sharked. 
That's not great. 
I'm so humiliated. 
 How could tracy not thank me? 
 What? 
I drag myself out of bed at 4:00 in the morning, go home, get dressed,  come in here, and he doesn't even mention my name? 
Jenna, the whole thing is fake. 
Yeah, but he thought it was real. 
Listen, I'm sorry. Tonight was crazy. 
But I did hear the janitor saying that your boobs looked good. 
I don't want to hear it, liz. 
Apparently, the only way to get respect around here is to act like tracy. 
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do. 
Now, please, get out of my dressing room so I can lock myself in it. 
The squirrel! 
It's not afraid of people! 
Oh, hi, C.C.Are you looking for jack? 
No, actually, I was hoping to talk to you. 
I hope you had fun last night. 
I did. 
Boy, you and jack make a hell of a celebrity team. 
 This is that chick who-- - venus williams. 
 Remember that time you fell asleep? 
 Captain beefheart. 
It's like we share a brain. 
I'm sorry you got stuck with kenneth. 
Okay. 
This is not a character from a television program. 
Okay, this is not a character from the bible. 
Pass. 
You can't pass, you hillbilly. 
No, I'm sorry. 
I don't normally slap people. 
Liz, I hate to put you on the spot,  but you know that I can't talk to any of my friends about jack. 
We can't keep sneaking around. 
This is getting ridiculous. 
I'm-A.. the plumber. 
I'm here-a to fix-a the washing machine. 
Come right in, mr. Spunatelli. 
If jack and i are gonna stay together, one of us has got to give something up. 
I just--I mean, is jack worth it? 
What would you do? 
I don't think you want to take advice from me on this. 
I mean, I ate a three musketeers bar for breakfast this morning,  and this bra is held together with tape, but-- . 
oh, liz, please well, jack is great. 
And he's crazy about you. 
But have you ever compromised for a man before? 
No. 
Me either. 
Oh, god, it was my birthday yesterday. 
I'm gonna talk to jack. 
Yeah, I think you should. 
Hey, guys, it's me, frank. 
Oh, no! Escalation! 
Okay, that hat's not cool, jackass. 
My mom's a great lady. 
Oh, was it her greatness that made your dad leave? 
He didn't leave. 
He's a submarine commander running silent. 
Let's watch this instead of working. 
Take off that costume. 
Take off yours! 
Never. 
C.C., What are you doing here? 
Jack, I convinced the sheinhardt wig plaintiffs to settle. 
That's fantastic news. 
What did they end up getting? 
5 million each. 
5 million.. each.That'S.. 
nba sexual assault money. 
They deserved more. 
The point is, now you and I can go public. 
We don't have to sneak around anymore. 
Slow down, C.C.It's not that simple. 
Well, what do you mean? 
I'm still up for a big promotion. 
My colleagues still revile you. 
But maybe in a year or so, we could reassess. 
Don't you understand what I have given up for you? 
Those little orange children deserved their day in court. 
They got 5 million. Each. 
But they deserved to be heard, jack. 
And I was ready to speak for them. 
We were going to go on oprah. 
Oh, so this is not about those kids. 
It's about you getting some publicity to get a leg up on your political career. 
I'm not going to apologize for being ambitious, jack. 
Well, you shouldn'T. I like 
when a woman has ambition. 
It's like seeing a dog wearing clothes. 
I was willing to give all that up for you. 
But you're obviously not willing to do the same. 
I just need more time. 
I should never have listened to a woman who tapes her bra together. 
Lemon. 
Don't worry, jack. 
I will sneak out through the freight elevator like I always do. 
I won't embarrass you. 
Everybody looks good in a sheinhardt. 
something's going down with jenna. 
She told an nbc tour that she was gonna get them all pregnant. 
So now I have two tracys--perfect. 
 Will you trade jobs with me? 
 Okay. 
But jenna wants this done a specific way. 
She's in her dressing room. 
Godspeed, liz lemon. 
liz, we have a serious crisis. 
 We're mad at each other-- - what?No. 
I have legitimate problems to deal with right now. 
But the toofer/frank rivalry has finally exploded. 
No one cares. 
Move, you're blocking me. 
I'm trying to get somewhere real. 
Is jenna in there? 
Bitch, are you in here? 
Jenna, why are you noat rehearsal? 
My entourage says I look tired. 
I'm sasha. 
This is patrice and master alexei. 
And your name i probably something like.. 
melissa. 
Okay. I get it.Fine. 
What do I need to do to make you feel appreciated and get them out of here? 
Too late. 
You had your chance. 
Ooh, melissa! Pick up your face, girl. 
I'm going to get my eyeballs whitened. 
I'll be back in a couple of hours. 
If I feel like it. 
What? No! 
We have work to do. 
This is what you get for taking me for granted all this time. 
Deal with that. 
Oh, melissa! 
Your face is on the phone. 
Soccer practice is over, and you need.. to pick it up! 
All right, that's a pretty good burn, patrice. 
Well, lemon, I hope you're happy. 
I'm not. Why? 
C.C.Is demanding thate go 
public with our relationship,  which is impossible, and you put the idea in her head. 
I'm sorry, jack. 
You know, I'm just saying what everybody's thinking. 
You just don't understand what I'm going through. 
Nobody understands what I'm going through. 
I'll take the next one, carville. 
Uh, actually-- have you got a minute? 
How do you and mary matalin make it work? 
I mean, she's a brilliant patriotic republican strategist,  and you--let's face it-- are a pinko nut job. 
You know, mary and I proved that true love can weather any storm. 
Even desert storm. 
But if it's the opinion of your peers that you're worried about,  you ed to get out in front of the story-- "cajun style." 
Break the news on your own terms, before your enemies find out. 
Cajun style. 
Dating a democratic congresswoman? 
These guys will destroy me for this. 
Jack, is it really the opinion of others that you worry about,  or are you learning something new about yourself,  and you find that a little scary? 
Cajun style. 
What are we gonna do? 
If we give up our feud now, we'll be ridiculed. 
Remember when lutz cried during that diamond commercial? 
It'll be worse than that. 
Oh, but I can't keep dressing like you. 
The new yorker festival is next week. 
We're trapped in a political minefield. 
How are we gonna get out of it? 
you boys need to change your story. 
Like karl rove did in the last election when he made it about gay folks and swift boats. 
What's your swift boat? 
You didn't hear this from me, but josh is starting to do something new with his hair. 
Are you james carville? 
Drop me an email and let me know how it goes. 
Trying to steal candy from a vending machine? 
Let me show you how it's done. 
Cajun style. 
Excuse me. 
What office should I put miss maroney's new writer in? 
What? No! 
Who said this guy gets an office? No! 
You let jenna take off in the middle of the day? 
If she gets to do that, then I'm doing this week's show as my altar ego Profsor cosmotosis. 
Where is jenna? 
I'm gonna take a nap. 
Wake me up if andy dick calls. 
Is this fun for you, being difficult? 
Oh, it is--I should have been doing it the whole time. 
You have been, jenna. 
You have always been difficult. 
You think tracy gets special treatment? 
I don't think. I know. 
Well, I coddle the crap out of you too. 
Your online fan club-- that's me. 
I made frank set that up as a punishment after he farted in my chair. 
And when you did that morning radio show the other week? 
Every caller was me. 
I am loving all of your characters. 
thanks for calling, sanjay. 
I really believe in karma. 
And this award you just got.. 
it's a cookie. 
I don't wanna do this stuff, bui have to because you're so insecure,  you get jealous of babies for their soft skin. 
And how much attention they get. 
I have lost years of my life taking care of you. 
I lie awake at night wondering what fresh hell tomorrow will bring. 
I don't sleep. 
I don't eat right. 
Thanks to you and tracy jordan-- mostly you. 
Oh, liz. 
That's all I wanted to hear. 
I'll be onstage in ten. 
And I'll wait till tomorrow to talk about you firing melon ball lady. 
All right. 
Not in front of the gays. 
hey, look who bailed on their lame feud. 
Hey, what's up with josh's new haircut? 
yeah, dude, you got a frohawk, man. 
What do you think, you're better than us? 
No, I don'T. 
I got a new nickname for josh. 
Dr.Haircut. 
It's not even my normal barber. 
My mom did it. 
Dr.Haircut! 
Dr.Haircut! 
Doctor.. 
are you gonna cry? 
Here's your john legend cd. 
I don't know why it was so urgent you have it before noon. 
It was just an excuse. 
Have lunch with me. 
But I have a plan. 
Do you trust me? 
Oh, god. I don't know. 
I'm 43, and you have great hair. 
I can let this play out a little longer. 
Then come with me. 
Jack, this is your executive dining rm. 
Are you trying to get me killed? 
C.C., These people are my peers, my 
heroes, my past and future secret santas. 
Their approval is the most important thing in the world to me-- or.. 
so I thought. 
Gentlemen, token ladies, I have an important announcement. 
Some of you may or may not recognize the woman standing beside me. 
Her name is celeste cunningham, and she is a democratic congresswoman.. 
From the state of vermont. 
And she is my lover. 
That's right. 
She's my liberal hippy-dippy mama. 
My groovy chick, my old lady. 
She was our chief adversary during the sheinhardt wig hearings. 
She wants to tax us all to death and make it legal for a man to marry his own dog. 
But I think what we have is special. 
And I'm proud of her. 
And I'm not going to hide it any longer. 
I'm jack donaghy, damn it.. 
and this is my woman. 
I.. gave to npr last year. 
My children go to public school. 
I'm gay. 
I'm black. 
Oh, jack, thank you so much! 
And I just want you to know that in 1984 i voted for ronald reagan. 
I murdered my wife. 
Good morning,jack. 
Lemon,I'm helping to organize a little fundraising dinner for john mccain this weekend, and I need some women to attend. 
So it doesn't turn into another giant sausage fest. 
Well,I don't know. 
What's the committee to reinvade vietnam? 
Just say you'll come. 
Jonathan's going to round up all the cool republican celebrities. 
Like who,chuck norris? 
No,C.Nor and I had a falling-out 
after I switched to another dojo. 
Ah,well,sorry, but I'm not giving anybody money until there's campaign finance reform. 
************* Oh,and I want you to book the subway hero onto the show. 
 Who? 
 The subway hero. 
Do you not watch the news? 
Food network doesn't have a news show. 
This guy stepped in front of a train to save a total stranger had fallen on the tracks. 
He pulled him between the rails, and the train missed their heads by inches. 
 Wow,that's amazing. 
 I know. 
Every show wants a guest appearance by the subway hero, but we have an advantage. 
We do? 
For his exceptional courage... 
the city of new york bestows the bronze medallion on dennis duffy. 
Thank you,mayor bloomberger. 
I accept this honor on behalf of every stern rules!Baba booey! 
No,no, no,no,no. 
Oh,yes. 
Dennis duffy,beeper salesman and your ex-boyfriend. 
And dateline predator. 
Exonerated dateline predator. 
The whole thing was one big silly misunderstanding. 
Like the giuliani campaign. 
No way,forget about it. 
Lemon,be professional. 
We all have to work with people we hate sometimes. 
Jonathan,why don't you put on more of that cologne? 
when I say subway,you say hero. 
 Subway. 
 Hero? 
proudly presents 30 Rock  Season02 Episode12 I now declare this store open for all mankind. 
Hey,dummy. 
Denn i knew you'd be ck. 
Yeah,I'm not back. 
Jack sent me because he wants you on tgs. 
No way, this is fate. 
You swe to me that you would never see me again, but this whole,crazy,on-again, off-again, dennis-liz thin it just can't be stopped. 
No,we don't have a crazy thing. 
Yeah,we do. We're like ross 
and rachel, but just not gay. 
Can I borrow those giant scissors? 
We always knew this would happen,didn't we? 
I mean, that I would be somebody. 
I can't believe it's happening because of this, and not because of my band. 
* I just want to rock * well,you have had some fame before. You were on dateline. 
I knew you were gonna say that. And it's so unfair. 
I knew that girl was 18. 
She told me that her last boyfriend was asian. 
And that crap doesn't start until college. 
So you want to do the show or not? 
I don't know. You know. 
Getting lots of offers from news and dancing programs. 
But how could I say no to you,right? 
I mean, maybe we should just see where this crazy dennis-liz roller coaster ride takes us, huh? 
Jonathan. 
Who is this? 
Oh,it's bucky bright, sir. 
He was a major tv star in the '40s,'50s and the fall of 1972, and he's your republican celebrity for the mccain dinner. 
Uh-huh,good to see you. What 
happened to bruce willis? 
He insists on singing. 
Jim belushi? 
He insists on singing. 
good god. When did the 
party become so boring? 
The democrats have all the good celebrities. 
mr. Donaghy, this 
was delivered to son of a married couple, bucky bright! 
you know who this is? 
Who doesn't? 
Most people. But let me 
ask you a question, kenneth. 
If mr. Bright here told you to 
vote republican, would you do it? 
Oh,no,sir,I don't vote republican or democrat. 
Choosing is a sin,so I always just write in the lord's name. 
That's republican we count those. 
Well,I don't know whether you know it or not, but I used to do the old soft shoe at all the eisenhower rallies. 
One,two... 
I'm sorry to have wasted your time, mr. Bright. 
Kenneth here will show you out. Thank you. 
Boy,30 rock. 
The stories I could tell about this place. 
Eh,nobody wants to listen to me anymore. 
Oh,mr. Bright, I would love to 
hear about the good old days. 
Oh,different back then, I'll tell you. 
Yes,sir,boy, they were classy. 
Yeah,ah we didn't have any of those shirts with words on 'em, or dungarees,or anything like that,o sirree. 
Men came to work, ties and hats. 
So elegant. 
Well,and you had tailor-made suits and a little place here for a little carnation in your lapel. 
And an inside monogrammed pocket,you know, for your opium pipe and your switchblade. 
I'm sorry what now? 
Say,why don't you show me around the old studio? 
Okay,okay. 
These things are so bad for me. 
400% of my sodium? I 
should not be eating these. 
Ladies and gentlemen,I give you the bravest new yorker since bernie goetz, mr. Dennis duffy. 
What's with the trophy? 
It's the stanley cup,honey. 
It's hockey's ultimate prize. 
And me and it,we're teaming up to fight illiteracy. 
Wow,I never would have had the guts to do what that dude did. 
You don't know that. 
I do know. I've watched seven 
different people die in subway stations. 
so,dennis,tell us what it was like in the moment. What was going through your mind? 
You know, it was all instinct,jack. 
My mind, it was it was so clear. 
All I could think about was derek jeter. 
And it was like check this out,jeter, you think you're better than me? 
So you brought dennis back. 
Only 'cause jack made me. 
It's just that you said never again, but here he is. 
You said, "I don't know what I see in that guy," but I was there when you two met. 
You do have this weird connection. 
Uh,why is this movie called the hours, when it feels so much longer? 
They should call this thing the weeks. 
The weeks. 
Liz,listen to me. 
Dennis is like those off-brand mexican cheetos. 
My sabor de soledad? 
I only have spanish delis in my neighborhood. 
You know those are bad for you, but you keep stuffing them in your mouth because it's easier to do that than to bother to eat well. 
That's a weak metaphor. 
You deserve a good meal, liz. 
Subway hero! 
subway hero! 
Subway hero! 
Tracy. My friend. 
Have you ever considered becoming the celebrity face of the republican party? 
What? Hell,no. 
Black people supporting republicans? 
Does hot support cold? 
Does rain support the earth? 
Now that misperception is precisely why the gop needs better celebrities, and a black celebrity such as yourself would really make us look good. 
Do you like lower taxes? 
If I paid taxes, I sure would. 
 How about gun ownership? 
 Go on. 
 States' rights? 
 I love states' rights. 
And let none of us forget the gop is the party of lincoln. 
Lincoln was a republican? 
actually, today's republican party would be unrecognizable to lincoln. 
He fought a war to preserve federal authority over the states. 
That's not exactly small government. 
Dotcom, this need you have to be the smartest guy in the room is... 
off-putting. 
I guess that's why i'm still single. 
Damn. The republican party sounds 
pretty attuned to my unique way of life. 
But I'd be turning my back on my people to support it. 
You put me in a quandary, jack donaghy. 
A quandary. 
Back then, we didn't have pages,you know. 
We had what we called "sandwich girls." 
Oh,'cause they got you sandwiches? 
No,no,no, two guys'd get hey,my old dressing room. 
You know,that reminds me. 
for five bucks I will. 
Hey,dummy, I was just telling these dummies how we used to go in the park and make fun of all the joggers. 
Oh,yeah,"oh,I'm gonna run in a circle,so I can live longer." 
Hold on a second. Who orders 
a salad from a burger joint? 
You watching your figure there, sweetheart? 
What,are you gearing up for swimsuit season? 
Very funny. 
Very funny? How would you know? 
We used to call this "the jew room." 
oh,here,here's some lettuce from my burger. 
Hey,chief, the,uh,the kid's birthday party that hired the urkel impersonator is down around the hall. 
 Are you gonna cry? 
 Yeah,he's gonna cry. 
give her some lettuce. 
Elizabeth conworthy lemon. 
Okay,that's not my middle name. 
Explain this. 
"subway hero dennis duffy and actress sally field." 
Entertaining a guest of the show is called being professional. 
It wasn't a date or whatever-- I paid for dinner. 
You always paid for dennis. 
He can't get credit cards, jenna, because his cousin teddy used dennis' social to get a cell phone that teddy then couldn't pay for because this indian guy that he was working for... 
you know what,I don't have to explain myself to you. 
oh,sir. You're back. 
Well,I never left, actually. 
I just wandered around the building all night. 
I didn't run into another single living soul, except one gigantic lesbian. 
Who is conan o'brien, and why is she so sad? 
What is this place? 
It's purgatory,tracy. 
Richard nixon? 
I can't believe i'm dead. 
There was still so much left on my bucket lis so many different kind of buckets I wanted to own. Buckets. 
It's never too late, tracy. 
You can't die now, your party needs you. 
We've lost some prestige because of the bush administration. 
And watergate. 
I'm trying to keep that on the dl around here. 
Look,I know you're worried about this, but there's a long history of black entertainers supporting the gop. 
Just ask my old friend, sammy davis jr. 
Oh,sam. Sammy. 
******* You were a republican? 
he sure was. 
Black,jewish,one eye, a white wife. 
It was a big tent back then,tracy. 
Help us... 
to make it a big tent once again. 
I got a mission. 
 Dennis. 
 Yeah,jack. 
What are your politics? 
Social conservative, fiscal liberal. 
You see the gop is trying to raise its celebrity profile. 
And we would love it, if the subway hero could help us out. 
Ah,no can do,pally. 
I can't help mccain. He's a navy man. 
I almost joined the marines once. 
All right,fine, I admit it. 
Dinner with dennis last night was fun. 
Oh,god,liz. 
What,I don't like a lot of people,jenna, but that dumb creep makes me laugh. 
But you know better. 
Do I? I might be an idiot. 
I know I'm supposed to make myself nice meals, instead of eating junk. 
Do you know what I use my oven for? 
Warming your jeans in the morning? 
That'sight, and it feels good. 
You know what that subway thing taught me,jack? 
It taught me to follow my instincts more. That's how you get ahead. 
You must know what I'm talking about--you smell rich. 
Thank you. 
My cologne is distilled from the bilge water of rupert murdoch's yacht. 
My point is,jack, you've got to be a man of action in this world, you know you can't overthink stuff. 
I agree. 
Not thinking is what makes america great. 
That wardrobe is wack. 
I want a leather jacket with a glow-in-the-dark skeleton t-shirt and a porkpie hat for my head,all right. Pronto. 
This photo shoot's gotta be phenomenal. 
You seem like a man who knows exactly what he wants. 
Yeah,I do. 
lemon? Good luck with that, dennis. 
No luck needed, jack. She 
bought me dinner last night. 
 Really? 
 Yeah,I'm in. 
And when I grab on, I do not let go. 
Like a killer whale going nuts on his trainer at sea world. 
Everything in my life is work. 
But not dennis duffy. 
I don't have to shave, I don't have to bathe, I don't have to be clever or nice,you know. 
I can just be myself. 
 Isn't that what love really is? 
 No. 
Love is hiding who you really are at all times, even when you're sleeping. 
Love is wearing makeup to bed and going downstairs to the burger king to poop, and hiding alcohol in perfume bottles. That's love. 
Uh,it just sounds hard. 
Being with dennis is easy. 
If you give into it,you just start to feel kind of numb and warm, and then you just get sleepy.That's not that bad. 
That's exactly what they say it's like when you freeze to death. 
Blurgh. 
Oh,whoa,whoa, look at,there I am. 
Oh,is that really you? 
Yeah,me and the boys. Yeah. Boy. 
Men were men back then, I'll tell you. 
You wanted to do something private with another man, it wasn't gay. 
No,it was just two men celebrating each other's strength. 
I'm in. Jacky D. 
Nixon's ghost convinced my ghost to help the gop. 
God bless that wiretapping bastard,this is great. 
We've got to shoot a couple commercials right away. The mccain dinner is saturday. 
Sounds good, but I can't talk now. 
 I gotta get my wallet out of the toaster. 
 Okay. 
Yeah,you like that? 
Maybe a couple photos where you don't give the thumbs-up. 
Nah,it's my thing,dummy. 
You know what? Doesn't matter. 
Just getting through the week. 
You know,it's all really happening for me. 
My people, my city, my woman, huh? 
I tell you,everything is starting to go my way,liz, 'cause I'm a man of action, yeah. 
I gotta stop overthinking everything like I used to. 
That was never your problem. 
Elizabeth sarah lemon that's not my middle name. 
 Will you marry me? 
 Oh,god. 
wake up,dummy. Hey,space 
cadet. Right here 
will you marry me or what? 
No,no way. 
You don't know this guy. He 
is not the man you think he is. 
Hey,what is your problem,liz? 
I could get any girl here i want. 
And not just the fatties and the butterfaces. 
Shut up,crowd. I command you 
as the subway hero-- shut up. 
Unbelievable,liz. Hey,you 
know, I don't need this. 
You know a stripper offered to give me a squeezer last night. 
A white stripper. 
Uh,thank god i didn't fall for this. 
You are not a hero, you're a loser. 
And you will always be a loser. 
Oh,I'm the loser. 
I guess I'm the one who totally missed catching the puck at that islanders game  you suck. 
 No,you suck. 
And so do all new york-based sports teams. 
Liz,don't say anything you can't take back. 
My fellow blackmericans-- hey,jack. 
Can I just say black americans? 
There's no such thing as blackmericans. 
That's great, that's why you're here. 
My fellow black americans, dr. King once had a dream, 
a dream that we all share: To build a 200 foot high wall to keep mexico out. 
And he also hated the estate tax. 
unbelievable. 
 Jack,I don't know about this. 
 What's wrong? 
I get it. The republican party means less 
taxes,more guns, and the end of the gun tax. 
Go on. 
But everybody isn't forward-thinking like I am. 
No matter what,blackmericans are gonna always vote democrat. 
They will, won't they? 
Unless... 
black people, don't vote. Just don't do it. 
In the amount of time it'd take for you to vote, you could play three games of pool. 
Three. And that's fresh. 
I'm tracy jordan, and I improve this message. 
paid by the committee to reinvade vietnam. 
Sure feels good to make a difference,doesn't it? 
Yes,it does. 
Now if you'll excuse me, nixon asked me to take some stuff out of his wikipedia page. 
Hey,jack,I'm sorry,this dennis thing is not gonna work. 
I can't even be in the same room as that idiot. 
Save it for your I-village blog, lemon. 
Dennis is off the show. 
I booked the 911 bird. 
Winston dialed 911 with his beak and said fire, but only because he didn't know the word for rape. 
Well,that's fine with me, but we've been promoting the subway hero. 
The subway hero's 15 minutes are up. 
Now if you could let him know that,that would be great. 
Hey,you're not bumping dennis for my benefit,are you? 
Well,of course I am. 
I base all my business decisions on your needs. 
That's why G.E.'S going to be 
introducing the pocket deep fryer. 
That would sell, by the way. 
Well,when we sobered up, we realized we'd eaten the peacock and we put the ham in pat weaver's office. 
Mr. Bright. 
With all due respect, I can't listen to this anymore. 
I love television,sir, and you are ruining it. 
I love television too. 
But I wanna tell you something. 
If you're gonna make something beautiful, you gotta make a mess of it first. 
I don't care whether you're making an omelet, a baby, or a television show, things are gonna get weird. 
Well,I'm afraid the biz has changed since your time. 
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to chinatown to pick up some human growth hormones so that mr. Jordan's tigers don't 
realize that he's aging, and... 
oh my... 
there's your weird. 
 A bird? 
 Dennis, I'm very sorry. 
Oh,really? Why? 
It seems like all that stuff you said came true. I am a loser. 
My mall appearance got canceled. 
The mighty ducks are mad at me because I left the stanley cup on a water taxi. 
You know, I thought I'd done something good enough to get you back. 
I can only imagine the classic song I'm gonna write after this. 
Well,that is a very disturbing story. 
Aw,you're just saying that. 
No,no,no,no,you've seen some stuff,I'll tell ya. 
Oh,well this one's dating a dateline predator. 
Exonerated. And we're not dating. 
You don't know what you're talking about,kenneth. 
Boy,that's one mouthy sandwich girl,isn't it? 
It was on a subway platform just like this. 
On a night just like this. 
It's still daytime. And we're inside. 
You know what the worst thing about this whole hero thing has been? 
Is that I got a chance to see what my life could have really been like. 
You know,if like the beeper business had taken off, or I hadn't failed the firefighter exam. 
You failed the firefighter exam? 
Yeah,it's totally biased against the irish,you know. 
You know,liz, being with you and being a hero are the two greatest things that's ever happened to me. 
And I just,uh, I just wish i could get it back. 
you're gonna be fine. 
If reality tv has taught us anything, it's that you can't keep people with no shame down. 
I really believe that you are gonna do something else great in your life. 
 Dennis,don't you dare. 
 Liz,work with me now.Just go limp. 
 It'll be phenomenal, liz,come on. 
 *******  Come on,no,no,no,no. 
 No,I don't want to. 
Ah,damn,it's the wrong track. It's stupid express. 
 You thought it was this track too,didn't you? 
 Jackass. 
What,come on. It was just a goof. 
Never again. Never! 
You'll be back, liz lemon. You'll be back. 
you'll be back,dummy. 
You wanted to see me? 
Yes, I did. 
This is a $54 steak. 
Congratulations. 
It looks really good. 
Yes, it does. 
But, of course, I can't eat it because of my recent... 
Heart attack. 
Secret heart attack. 
No strenuous activity, no red meat, no booze. 
But I thought perhaps you might enjoy it. 
Oh, okay. Thanks. 
This'll make a great sandwich tomorrow. 
No. I would like you 
to eat it here. 
Right now. 
You want to watch me eat this steak in front of you? 
That's what I want. 
Okay. 
This is a time of new beginnings for me, Lemon. 
And, of course, that means new opportunities. 
Have you read the interview with Don Geiss in this month's issue of "Yachting Illustrated"? 
No. I subscribe 
to "Giant Boats." 
"'The ocean,' says Geiss, 'like business or the pillowy abyss of a lover's bosom, seems infinite. 
But all things must end."' 
"Pillowy abyss"? 
Ignore that part. 
"All things must end." 
Geiss is sending signals about retirement, about succession. 
By talking about sex in a sailing magazine? 
That's exactly how Margaret Thatcher did it. 
Geiss' job is the most coveted position in the free world. 
You're in the running for it, right? 
I would like to think so. 
But I've got to do something to raise my profile, to distinguish me in some way. 
And I have to do it soo... 
You ate that whole thing? 
A dog took it. 
He came out of nowhere. 
Hey, Jenna. 
What's up? 
Pretty good. 
Are you okay? 
I'm fine, Jenna. 
I'm just a little light-headed. 
I'm on a crash diet to get back to my old weight by Friday. 
What diet is gonna do that? 
It's the Japanese Porn Star Diet. 
I only eat paper. 
But I can eat all the paper I want, so... 
Hey, there. 
Hi. 
Jenna, this isn't healthy. 
Maybe you're just fighting your natural shape. 
When did your mom gain all that weight? 
Oh, God! 
My point is, don't let people make you crazy about this. 
You are just as beautiful and talented as you ever were. 
No. No, no, no. 
You are fat. 
Go and see Dr. Spaceman right 
now and get this taken care of. 
How come men can be heavy and be respected? 
Like James Gandolfini or Fat Albert? 
It's a double standard, and America needs to get over its body-image madness. 
Oh, come on. 
What are we, back in college, freshman year? 
Let's go to the common room and talk about apartheid. 
I'm sorry if I care about making the world a better place. 
You should be. 
It's a complete waste of time, and it prevents you from dealing with this. 
Excuse me. What about "this" 
do I have to deal with? 
How's your love life going? 
I believe that love comes to you when you're not looking for it. 
Did you return that wedding dress you bought? 
I'm gonna sell it online, but my Internet is being weird. 
How about the furniture for your "home office"? 
Have you even set that up yet? 
I'm not making excuses, Jack. 
But "this" is taken care of. 
Ow. 
Ah, nerds! 
I missed a dentist appointment this morning. 
WOMAN ON P. A: 
Josh to the stage, please, for "llleana Douglas Talk Show." 
Son of a bitch. 
Banks. 
What are you doing in town? 
Were you drawn to the phallic nature of our skyline? 
Very funny, Jack. 
How gay is this? 
I'm here visiting my fianc�e. 
What? 
Kathy... 
this is Jack Donaghy. 
Banks, have you lost your mind? 
Oh, did I forget to mention that Kathy is Kathy Geiss? 
As in Don Geiss' daughter. 
Can you believe that Don thought she'd never get married? 
You can't. 
You're gay. 
No. 
Not anymore, friend. 
Are you familiar with the Church of Practicology? 
You mean the cult that was invented by Stan Lee? 
No, I mean the religion founded by the alien king living inside Stan Lee. 
You see, it's my faith in Practicology that has helped me uncover my true straight self. 
It's definitely working. 
I can totally feel the gay draining right out of me. 
By the eye of Zolnak, right, guys? 
You're going to be Don Geiss' son-in-law? 
That's right. 
And if you read his recent interview in the "Harvard Gay Business Review," you know that he's thinking about retirement. 
But I guess I'll find out more about that tonight at dinner. 
With Geiss. 
At a restaurant. 
Josh to the stage, please. 
Yo, Ken. 
Angie and Grizz is coming by to drop some of my stuff off. 
Oh. Okay. 
But I want her to know I'm having a good time on my own, so you should go get us some party hats. 
The pointy kind. 
Mr. Jordan, 
can't you just apologize to her? 
No! Things have been said 
that cannot be taken back. 
She called my vanity license plate inscrutable! 
"I see you ate one. 
Am l"? 
Hilarious! 
Angie is in the past, like Dracula and broadcast television. 
I think you're letting your pride get in the way. 
I mean, if you saw Angie with another man... 
With who? 
That guy Mike that redid our driveway? 
Nah, whatever. 
She should find someone new. 
Doesn't bother me. 
Dot Com, I have an idea. 
Well, I don't know, but it's worth a shot. 
Are you even listening to me? 
Now, Jenna, medically speaking, for your height, your weight puts you in what we call the disgusting range. 
Fortunately, there are solutions. 
For example, crystal meth has been shown to be very effective. 
How important is tooth retention to you? 
It's pretty important. 
Okay. 
What about my crazy surgical options, Dr. Spaceman? 
Please. 
"Dr. Spaceman" is my dad. 
Call me Leo. 
And there are some wonderful crazy surgical options. 
Are you familiar with the Bradshaw Clinic? 
Am I? That's where 
the Olsen twins were separated. 
I've sent a number of my famous clients there. 
I can make a call, get you in as soon as possible. 
Oh, thank you, Leo. 
I can't be on television looking like I just had a baby. 
This, right here, is why I got into medicine. 
Devin's a genius. 
A genius? Isn't he just living 
a lie to get ahead at work? 
We all have our secrets. 
Devin's pretending to be straight. 
I'm trying to keep my heart episode under wraps. 
And Alan Garkel in legal? 
I don't think he needs that wheelchair. 
No! 
Aah! 
Uh, Mr. Banks. 
I didn't see you there. 
I've been following you for the better part of an hour, Kenneth. 
Does Mr. Donaghy know 
you're here? 
I don't need Jack's permission, Kenneth. 
I'm gonna be running this place soon. 
And there are gonna be some changes to the pages' uniforms, certainly. 
Mr. Banks, Mr. Donaghy 
eats guys like you as part of a healthy breakfast. 
And I'm sure you think he's weak right now, but he's only gotten stronger since his heart attack. 
Heart attack? 
Really? 
Right, Mr. D? 
High five! 
Not now? Okay. 
What is this? 
Liposuction? 
Plus bone shaving and organ reduction. 
Ugh! 
Liz, you don't understand. 
People look at me differently now. 
Jack, the writers, the manager at Forever 21. 
That is their problem, not yours. 
Is this clinic on a boat? 
Hey, I've got a character for Jenna called "Me Want Food." 
She's in a supermarket, and she keeps going, "Me want food!" 
What? No. 
We are not treating Jenna any differently. 
She's gonna play all the characters she usually plays. 
Like Hillary Clinton. 
That's awesome. 
"Fat Hillary." 
She can be like, "Me want food!" 
No one is saying, "Me want food," Frank. 
We are going to showcase Jenna's talents. 
Can I sing a song on the show? 
Yes. 
That's a great idea. 
Can I sing and rollerdance? 
Yes. 
Yeah, because we are going to dare America to change their own attitudes about body image. 
Why do you have to make everything into an issue? 
Don't you have things to do in your own life? 
At least I don't live with my mom. Ow! 
Hey, my mom's cool. 
I've got my life together, okay? 
Holy crap! 
Did your tooth just fall out? 
That's not great, huh? 
Oh, check this out. 
My key to the city of Gary, Indiana. 
Mm! Look at this. 
My gold record from that novelty party song. 
Werewolf bar mitzvah? 
Spooky, scary? 
Boys becoming men? 
Men becoming wolves? 
Well, I'm going now. 
Is there anything else you want to say, Tracy? 
Yeah. 
I miss you, Grizz. 
Ugh! 
Hello, Angie. 
I hear you're single now. 
That's cool. 
What? 
I like your top. 
I'm a real good sex person. 
I do it all the different ways. 
Uh-huh. 
Well, I don't have a husband anymore. 
So you can come over anytime. 
Oh, I will. 
I'll come over at night. 
Good job, Kenneth. 
You should see my A-game. 
So, Dad... 
Can I call you "Dad"? 
Why not? I have a grandkid 
who calls me "Don." 
Next time he does it, I'm marching that little bastard to a recruiting station. 
Great story, Dad! 
Don! Devin! 
Jack! Small world. 
Join us. 
Are you sure? 
I wouldn't want to intrude. 
This is Manal. 
I never should have said we were going to a restaurant. 
She got big. 
Ooh, her center of gravity is a little different. 
Me want food! 
Did you happen to tell Geiss about my little episode? 
Come on, Jack. 
I'd never rat you out. 
Wouldn't want to let you off that easy. 
Here. 
Why don't you take some of my steak? 
I could never eat this much meat. 
That's not what I hear. 
Jack, we're having a little get-together up at the house on Saturday. 
You should come. 
That would be my pleasure, sir. 
Yeah, you should come. 
It's gonna be a whole day of team sports and beer. 
Get the ol' heart rate up. 
Maybe pound a cheeseburger in the sun. 
Throw some butter on it. 
You're gonna love it. 
I'm gonna make your heart explode. 
Hey, Ken. 
You're up early, Mr. Jordan. 
I only got 11 or 12 hours sleep last night. 
I got something on my mind-grapes I need to talk to you about. 
Oh. 
What is it, sir? 
I saw you hitting on Angie the other day. 
Seeing you with her, it opened my eyes. 
Good for you, sir. 
Yeah. All those years 
fooling around, it wasn't fair to her. 
So you got to make it fair. 
I want you to go to my house and make love to my wife, Ken. 
Jiminy Christmas! 
My home address is in the GPS under "DaCrib" 'cause we live on DaCrib Avenue. 
Now, you go to Angie. 
And you make sure you pleasure her. 
Well, they did laugh. 
At you, Jenna. At. 
Right. 
The bad kind. 
You just can't be a real woman in this country. 
God! It's like those Dove 
commercials never even happened. 
Hey! Oh! 
"Me want food"! 
This woman was a Mouseketeer, ma'am. 
Let it go, Liz. 
Me want food! 
Oh, my God. 
My own T-shirt! 
Hey! 
I am wanting the foods! 
Very good. Very nice. 
Thataboy! 
Yes! 
Thanks, Jack! 
You earned me a grand! 
Thank you. 
How's the heart holding up, buddy? 
You know, you ought to just quit. 
Geiss loves quitters, if I understood his autobiography correctly. 
Oh, wait. 
I didn't. 
You know what? 
It's all right, Jack. 
When you're dead and I'm CEO... 
Oh, my. 
Winthrop! 
How do you do it, man? 
You're always in such great shape. 
Same weight as when I wrestled at Yale, Jack. 
Winthrop here wrestled at Yale. 
With other dudes or... 
Banks here says he can pin you. 
Well, I don't know... 
Okay. 
You're so strong. 
Oh, God. 
You're having your way with me. 
Your back is like a barrel of snakes. 
Oh, God! 
I'm just your doll. 
I think I love you. 
We're joking. 
It's all jokes. 
This is no ordinary love? 
What have I done? 
Kenneth should be back by now. 
What's going on over at my house? 
This is no ordinary love? 
No ordinary love? 
No! 
No! 
I got to stop this! 
Wow. 
There she is. 
Me Want Food. 
Did you know, scientifically speaking, that humans want food but don't need it? 
I'm really having second thoughts about all of this. 
Oh, don't worry. 
Dr. Wally is the best there is. 
In a few hours, you'll be back to your old self. 
It'll be like none of this ever happened. 
I'm keeping it! 
Uh, what? 
The fat. 
I've decided to keep it. 
Because people recognize me and I get off on it. 
If you're gonna do this, it's got to be because we are proving a point to the world. 
Ugh! I'm not trying to prove 
anything. 
And you've got to stop telling people how to run their lives. 
That's not what this is. 
And it's kind of hard to take life advice from a single woman who is using her treadmill as a hanger for a wedding dress. 
Oh, I'm supposed to put it in the closet with ham fat all over it? 
And who's wearing a one-piece swimsuit instead of underwear. 
I have to do laundry. 
There he is! 
Hey, Jack. 
Want a hot dog? 
Oh, right. 
The sodium. 
Bum-bum. 
Bum-bum. 
Ka-boom! 
Just so you know, if you hear this sound at your funeral, it's just me laughing. 
I can't hear you, Banks. 
Are you saying you want me to help you? 
Oh. 
And if I do, you'll stop trying to destroy me in front of Geiss? 
Oh. 
That is what you're saying, right? 
Here we go. 
You're insane! 
That's it. 
I quit. 
No more football. 
Jack wins. 
Quitter! 
Oh, God! 
Just like the Greeks. 
I'm gonna kill you, Kenneth the Page! 
I'm sorry, Mr. Jordan. 
I couldn't do it. 
This boy comes to the door, tries to kiss me, then he throws up and starts crying. 
My body wouldn't let me violate the sacred bonds of marriage. 
It was a gesture, Angie. 
I'm saying I'm sorry! 
I'm at the end of my rope, Tracy Jordan. 
But, baby! 
Mnh-mnh. 
No more jewelry with my name misspelled. 
No more sexually explicit skywriting. 
And no more white boys throwing up in my damn foyer! 
What do you want? 
I'm willing to try anything. 
Okay. 
Here's what I want. 
From now on, I'm on you like white on rice. 
You are not to leave my sight for one second. Ever. 
All right. 
If that's what it takes. 
If that's what it takes. 
This grilled cheese has mayonnaise in it! 
What? 
Hmm. 
Is it really worth it? 
I wonder. 
I almost let a man die today, Caitlin. 
And for what? 
For a bigger office? 
For more money? 
Jack. 
So, how's the ticker? 
Devin told me. 
He said you're not a well man. 
Why don't we forget about Devin for the moment? 
Are you concerned about my heart, sir? 
No, not at all. 
Not after today. 
You were out there with those boys in your condition. 
Talk about heart. 
Take care of yourself, Jack. 
I've technically died twice. 
It's not fun. 
But I'm not going to be around forever. 
At some point, I want to spend more time with my grandkids. 
Take my boat down to the islands. 
Get to know my secret family up in Canada. 
But I want you to know you're on my list. 
Jack, you might run this company one day. 
Thank you, sir. 
You mind if I watch you eat that? 
Okay. 
Werewolf bar mitzvah? 
Spooky, scary? 
Boys becoming men? 
Men becoming wolves? 
Werewolf bar mitzvah? 
Spooky, scary? 
Boys becoming men? 
Men becoming wolves? 
Liz, Lutz and I are gonna walk around Times Square and pretend to be foreign. 
I am from Homburg, yah. 
Wanna come? 
Oh, I can't. My cousin is in town. 
All right. 
See ya though. 
Liz, I'm getting drinks with recently-divorced camera guy. You in? 
Legally separated sound guy's gonna be there. 
I-I don't feel well. 
Okay. 
Hey, Liz Lemon. 
I'm going to an animals-only strip club. Interested? 
Does that meane animals strip, or the animals are the customers? 
Animal customers? That's ridicous. 
Well, um, I have got a date. 
So... I... yeah. 
Order, please. 
 Hi, order for pickup. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
Yes, I would like a meatball sub with extra bread. 
 And my name is   Liz? 
Yeah, that's me. Okay. 
Big night, Lemon? 
Let me guess. 
Meatball sub, extra bread. 
Bottle of NyQuil. 
TiVo top chef. 
A little Miss Bonnie Raitt. Lights out. 
No, I have something to do tonight, Jack. 
Then you won't mind when I tell you that, uh... 
Casey gets voted off tonight. 
You monster! 
Why are you like this? 
corrected 30 Rock Season02 Episode07 Sir, Tracy's here with a bunch of kids. 
He wants to know if you have a minute to meet with them? 
Absolutely not. 
J.D.! 
There he is. 
I want you to meet the baseball team I'm coaching. 
A group of fine young men and one special lady. 
Dijonaise is a boy's name? 
Pardon me. 
Tracy, this is wonderful. 
I had no idea you were interested in baseball. 
I wasn't. 
My motorcycle hit a police horse. 
This is community service. 
These kids come from Knuckle Beach, the worst neighborhood in New York. 
They are poor as hell. 
Baseball is a wonderful sport, boys. 
I remember when my high school team won the Boston city championship. 
Everyone told us we were gonna lose, because our team was all white, and the other team was completely anyway, we won, and I learned that anything is possible. 
Baseball taught me how to win. 
Baseball taught me how to dream. 
What are your dreams? 
When I grow up, I'm gonna do vending machine maintenance. 
I'm gonna get shot by a cop and sue the city. 
I'm a be a talkative doorman with a drinking problem. 
That's right. You shoot for the stars. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
These are not the dreams of winners. 
These aren't winners. 
They're 0 and 17. 
Damn, we supposed to be at the game right now. 
0 and 18! 
That one's on coach Tracy. 
Someday I'll have an office like this... to clean. 
You could have an office like this of your very own. 
All you need is someone to point you in the right direction. 
A role model. 
Like R. Kelly and Michael Vick. 
Faves. 
 Thanks. 
 There you go. 
Uh, grandy? 
Oh, my God. Who ordered the veal? 
Am I right, guys? 
Ugh, Jenna, that guy is a baby. 
 Uh, Lutz? 
 I'm Lutz. 
You ordered a Venti chocolate mocha blast with half and half and brownie chunks? 
Thank you. Jamie. 
I like your blond streaks. 
It's very Simon LeBon. 
Who? 
Oh, you're young. 
Give it up, Jenna. 
You're talking to an ultrasound. 
Now I'm getting attitude from the sexy librarian over here. 
What? Sexy? You are. Shut up. 
Wow, that guy is adorable. 
Frank's gay. 
Maybe I am gay... 
for that little peach. 
You wanna kiss him? 
I do. 
I wanna kiss him on the mouth. And hold him. 
What are you talking about? 
Something just happened, Liz. 
Come on, you read Boobs magazine. 
I want Jamie. 
Yeah, you're gay. 
He's totally gay for Why isn't this any fun? 
come on! Gather 'round!Circle up! 
Everybody, circle up! 
All right, circle up. Circle up. 
Around me! Around me! 
All right, isten, that's enough. 
There's a weird dude standing over there. 
And I don't wanna get shot today, so great hustle, great practice. 
Okay, the weird dude is gone. Go home. 
Hey, you guys! It's that king we met. 
Good afternoon, boys. 
I've been thinking a lot about you, and I decided that I wanna help. 
Starting with some new uniforms. 
Compliments of the Sheinhardt wig company. 
You wanna be a bunch of winners? 
You've gotta dress for success. 
That's why I sponsor a charity that gives away tuxedos to homeless people. 
It was a beautiful ceremony. 
Mazel tov. 
That's right. Put them on. 
You don't get these kids, Jack. 
They don't care about winning. 
They just wanna be able to go outside for once. 
You know, our first practice they asked me what the sun was? 
Hey, Jamie! 
Did you just come from working out, or are you naturally veiny? 
Pull it together, Frank. 
All right. Okay. 
Good to see you, man! 
Thanks. 
So I don't want to interrupt or anything, But, um, are you doing anything saturday night? 
Just gellin' like Magellan. 
Okay, well. 
Uh, my friend's DJing at this gallery opening, and, um, he can get us in if you wanna go. 
Oh, no, I don't think so. 
Oh, come on. It'll be fun. 
Jamie, how old do you think I am? 
I don't know. Uh, 29? 
Wow, you are good at guessing ages. 
I am exactly 29, but you're a baby. 
No, I'm not. I'm 25. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
I thought you were younger. 
And I'm 29, so... 
so you'll go? 
Awesome. 
Dude. I totally forgot. 
I bought you a sweater. 
It's slim fitting. 
They call it a French cut. 
And it wasn't on sale or anything. 
Woe, thanks. 
Do you need help trying it on? 
No. 
So I'll pick you up around 10:00? 
At night? Okay. 
That sounds great. 
Great. Where are we going? 
Frank. 
 Stop it. 
 I can't. 
I'm gay for Jamie. 
No, that's not a thing. 
You can't be gay for just one person,  unless you're a lady, and you meet Ellen. 
Well then,  I got some real thinking to do. 
It's scary. 
But also exciting. 
I can't believe I did that. 
I told myself I would never lie about my age. 
These things happen, Liz. 
I had my "No sex with Asians" rule, but then one day you walk into Sharper Image, and there's Quan. 
Forget it. I'm gonna 
order some more coffee, and then he'll come back, and I can cancel. 
No, this is a good thing. 
A hot guy thinks you're 29. 
He is cute. 
He looks like Zac Efron. 
That's a thing, right? 
Oh, go for it, Liz. 
I always roll with it when hot guys think I'm 22. 
What can we do? 
We're cougars. 
 We're what? 
 Cougars. 
Hot older ladies pouncing on their young prey. 
There was a whole article about it in Vanity Fair. 
The one with the Crisis In Africa cover. 
God, it makes me so sad that more people don't know about cougars. 
Why am I looking for something to wear in wardrobe? 
Why don't you go to Abercrombie and Fitch? 
Oh, no. It's too loud in there. 
No, don't say that. 
Cougars have to act young. 
You should get a ring pop to suck on. 
What are you doing? 
Figuring some stuff out. 
Sorry, Jenna, I'm probably gay now. 
It's never gonna happen between us. 
You wanted to see me? 
Hello, coach. 
I thought we'd have a little meeting before today's practice. 
Practice? Meetings? 
What is this? A marriage? 
Phil Jackson likes to give books to his players to inspire them, so which biography of Winston Churchill do you think would improve Rashid's bunting? 
Jack, have you ever been to Knuckle Beach? 
It's a totally different world. 
A world where orange soda's an acceptable substitute for breast milk. 
Tracy, I don't have to understand their world in order to help them. 
It's like this great country of ours. 
We can go into any nation, impose our values, and make things better. 
It's what Bush is doing all over the globe. 
Bush! 
Now, I don't wanna go off on a rant here. 
So I suppose the next step would be to bring our superior resources to bear. 
Kenneth, show him the drawing of the new field. 
Sorry. 
This is my dream journal. 
They've all come true so far. 
FUN TIMES ACCOMPLISHED What the heck is going on out here? 
You didn't get behind grounders. 
You didn't work the pitch count. 
There was nothing Churchillian about that performance. 
And where are their uniforms? 
You can't wear blue in Knuckle Beach, which is hard because jeans go with everything. 
Tracy, your failure of leadership is unacceptable. 
Now you gonna blame this on me? 
I told you this was gonna happen. 
Extly. 
I need somebody who believes in what we're doing here. 
Tracy, you're fired. 
Kenneth, you're in charge. 
So you like the music? 
Yeah, speaking of music I like, how about Gnarls Barkley, huh? 
That guy's great. 
Have you been to his official website? It's really 
Oh God, is it only 1:00 am? 
Yeah, so after this I figure we hit up Marquee. 
They only serve drinks till 4:00, but I can get us into this great after-hours club in Brooklyn. 
 I'm 37. 
 What? 
I'm 37. Please don't 
make me go to Brooklyn. 
I'm 20. 
Oh, boy. 
This just went from a senior dating a freshman to Mary Kay Letourneau and Vili Fualaau. 
Are those friends of yours? Or... 
Oh, when will death come? 
Lemon, what happened, did you take an Ambien with your Franzia and sleepwalk here? 
No, I am out on a date. 
I know you. You deliver my coffee. 
You're here with Lemon? 
Yes, sir. 
I'm Jamie, Mr. Donaghy. 
Oh, what a polite young man. 
Ooh, they just changed bartenders. I'm 
gonna go see if this guy'll serve me. 
Where did you two meet, an amber alert? 
I just found out that he's 17 years younger than me. 
I knew I shouldn't have done this. 
I look ridiculous. 
Oh, nonsense. You've never looked better. 
Do I look ridiculous when you see me with a younger woman? 
Boy, the art in here is hung really level. 
A youthful companion is the ultimate status accessory. 
Well, maybe you can pull that off. You're a man. 
It's different for women. 
That is so sexist of you. 
To that clueless boy over there, you're a very powerful woman. 
Technically you're a catch. 
You've got money, status, naturally thick hair, a decent set. 
All right. 
Tell me, have you been on a date since Floyd? 
No. 
Why are you so against having fun in your life? 
I'm not against fun. 
I went up on my roof the other day. 
Stop fighting this. 
He's hot, poor, and eager to please. 
Just buy him a few gifts and never give him your home phone number. 
And if you set a curfew, stick to it. 
Oh, gosh. Okay. 
Hey, coach. How did practice go today? 
Sir, conditions have deteriorated. 
I made DeMarquis captain like you said. 
But having a kid from Trinidad in charge made the latinos real mad. 
And they all seem to really hate my grandpa. 
'Cause they keep yelling, "Kill, whitey." 
And I'm, like,"what do you think you are, alcohol?" 
All right, Kenneth, calm down. 
There was bound to be some unrest once we removed Tracy. 
They're testing our resolve. 
Stay the course. 
Kenneth! 
Mr. Jordan. About what 
happened I don't wanna talk about it, Ken. 
You'll hear all I have to say about Jack Donaghy in my tell-all book, betrayal, colon, what really happened with my baseball team, comma, disaster at Knuckle Beach, question mark. 
What the hell is going on? 
It's chaos, sir. 
They've turned on each other. 
And they won't listen, especially when I'm saying, "Don't hit me with my own shoes." 
I think things may have been better under Mr. Jordan. 
We're not gonna look back now, Kenneth. 
Tracy didn't understand what needed to be done. 
He had to go. 
They're destroying all the things I bought for them. 
Everything but the bats, sir. 
Oh, god. They see us. 
You kids put those bats down! 
For the love of God. 
Oh, Liz. 
Did I see you saturday at Marquee? 
I was there. Yes. 
So what were you doing there? 
Is it like that time they found my grandpa at the bus station? 
No, I was there with Jamie, the coffee guy. 
And we had a great time. 
Coffee guy? 
That'll really make your ex-husband jealous. 
Cerie, for the last time, I have never been married. 
That's the spirit! 
Hey, Liz. This is Aidan. 
Guess you're not the only cougar in town. 
Aidan's a freshman at nyu. 
Aren't you, Aidan? 
Sure. Do you have any change for a soda? 
But you just had one. 
Whatever. 
Don't you whatever me. 
Hey, hey, what did I say about you wearing your heelies inside? 
Aidan! Wait up, Aidan. 
There she is. 
The cradle robber. 
Yeah, that's right. 
I have a boy toy, and we look awesome together. 
That's great, Maude. 
How's Harold? 
His name is Jamie. 
And you know what? 
I don't spend a lot of time worrying about his feelings. 
I just know he's super-cute, and he laughs at all my jokes. 
Coffee's here. 
Hey there! 
I had fun the other night. 
Your roof is awesome. 
Oh, thanks. I go up there all the time. 
So, uh, you wanna get some lunch? 
Oh, I can't. I have a lot of work to do. 
Okay. 
'Cause I already got Randy to cover my shift. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
But I bought you a video game. 
Bioshock? No way! 
Hey, chatterbox. 
I thought I heard your voice. 
How was your weekend? 
It was great. 
Liz and I I made you a painting. 
It's called one-armed mermaid that's part unicorn with big foot. 
Thank you. 
Are we still on for tomorrow night? 
 Yeah, I can't wait. 
 No, he can't. 
We're working out. 
I'll see ya tomorrow night. 
Yeah, I'll take it. Thank you. 
Liz, be good to him. 
What do you want, Jack? 
Tracy, I wanna talk to you. 
It's hard for me to admit when I've made a mistake... 
so I won't. 
Mr. Jordan, I have made 
a terrible mistake. 
Because of my arrogance, the team is now in chaos. 
Pedro and Fontanelle quit because I tried to put them in the outfield. 
Of course they did! 
They're afraid to go north of 245th street. 
Next you'll be telling me you let Reshon have contact with his birth mother. 
Which Reshon? 
Jack, I told you, you did not know what you were getting yourself into. 
Tracy, I only wanted to help. 
And now things are out of control. 
We have two options. 
One, we can cut and run and betray the people that we made this commitment to, or you and I can form a coalition. 
No way, JD. 
Tracy, I thought you cared about these kids. 
Just because I don't support Jack donaghy, doesn't mean I don't support the kids. 
But sir, every one of them wrote you a letter asking you to come back. 
Jack. 
If I come back to the team, can I throw these things away and not have to read 'em? 
Tracy, I'll pay somebody to read them for you. 
With your know-how and my resources, we can turn these kids into winners. 
All right, Jack. 
What's the plan? 
One word: Surge. 
That's two words! 
Jamie... 
Look, Jamie, I can't take this sam and diane thing anymore. 
I need to know what we're doing here. 
Nothing, Frank. I'm not gay. 
I'm not gay either. 
That's why it's perfect. 
We're just two straight guys who wanna enjoy each other's bodies. 
I gotta go. 
Damn, I can't believe we're winning. 
I knew the surge would work. 
Way to go, Manuel! 
That one goes out to W.S.Churchill. 
Hey, there's no way that those batters were born after 1993. 
These dominican birth certificates say otherwise. 
Esteban! You're up. 
This is just embarrassing. 
You look nice. 
Oh, thank you. 
Oh, I got you that leather bracelet that you were looking at. 
Oh, that's so ill. Thank you. 
It is ill. 
All right, we should get going because we're gonna be late. 
No we won't, baby. 
We're takin' a cab. 
Really? 
I've never been in a cab with less than seven people. 
Well, stick with me. 
I will. 
Look at us. 
We look awesome together. 
Yeah, now I know why demi moore does this. 
I get that reference. 
All right, mom. I'm takin' off. 
Mom? 
Yeah, I'm 20. 
I can't afford this place. 
All right, honey, have a good time. 
I'm beth. 
Yep, that's what we look like. 
Shut it down. 
Oh, hey, Jamie. 
That is so awkward now. 
Oh, don't worry about it.  
You had your fun. 
 But the end was humiliating. 
 Of course it was. 
All may-december relationships end in humiliation, sexual incompatibility, social faux pas, meeting their parents, it's classic. 
I'm not sure it's worth it. 
Don't be silly. Jamie was good for you. 
A younger companion makes you feel more alive. 
Opens you up to new experiences. 
Fresh points of view. 
Stimulating conversation. 
 Stop repeating what I say  stop repeating what I say. 
 Look, Aidan, I swear to God  Look, Aidan, I swear to God. 
 You know what? This is over. 
 You know what? This is over. 
Of course, there are some exceptions. 
Thank God I'm off the market. 
Oh, are you seeing someone? 
What? No. 
I mean this company is my girlfriend. 
She gives me all the loving I'll ever want or need. 
That's gross, Jack. 
 Stop hitting yourself, Jenna! 
 Oh, God! 
Why are you like this? 
Guys! This isn't working! 
I'm not gay-gay. 
I'm just gay for Jamie. 
Frank, I don't think that's a thing. 
It is. 
Look, you dudes are great, a lot of fun to dance with, and you smell awesome. 
Enjoy your night. 
Bye, sexy bear! 
Terence! You make us all look so bad. 
Oh,hey,I,uh,I found your lipstick. 
Oh,no,this isn't mine. 
This is sunset blush. 
I wear tiger orgasm. 
But it was in my apartment. 
I don't know why I told you about the pop-tart. 
But that's weird. 
It's just me and pete at my place. 
Hello,ladies. 
Pete's having an affair. 
What? 
The lipstick,the spring in his step. 
The sexy justin timberlake hat. 
No,no,he's still married. 
I don't know what to tell you. 
The only reason men start taking care of themselves is if they're getting someone to have sex with them. 
If it wasn't for that,they'd just sit at home in their own filth. 
Hey,Liz. 
We're out of string cheese,so I think i'm gonna take off. 
What sketch is that for? 
It's not for a sketch. 
It's part of our new company-wide global eco initiative. 
We're going green,Lemon. 
And do you know why? 
To save the earth? 
So we can drain the remainder of its resources. 
Don Geiss is a genius. 
He's pitting all of the divisions of the company against each other to see who can make the most money from this environmentalism trend. 
And I am going to win with... 
greenzo! 
Saving the earth while maintaining profitability. 
That's right,jared. 
Greenzo is america's first non-judgmental, business-friendly environmental advocate. 
The free market will solve global warming,  if that even exists. 
 My boy. 
Greenzo? 
Is that the first name that came to your head? 
Can you believe it? I mean,it 
just popped rightthere. 
proudly presents 30 Rock Season02 Episode05 You're gonna be great,jared. 
I'm just so excited about this gig,sir. 
I mean,what a what a sweet gig. 
I've got a gig. 
Yeah,you're saying "gig" a lot. 
Oh,I'm so sorry. 
I haven't worked in a while. 
My last real job was an ad for rick lazio's new york senate campaign. 
Hillary clinton wants an all-homosexual army. 
How will that affect my family? 
Well,thankfully,those days are behind you. 
Your billboard's going up in times square. 
You're releasing an endangered falcon during halftime at the knicks game. And... 
you're booked on the today show. 
Oh,wow,the today show! 
I just wish my mom were still alive so I could rub it in her fat face. 
Uh,come with me. 
He's having another party. 
Howdy. 
Hope you can make it. 
See ya there. 
What's up,Lemon? 
I'm hiding from Kenneth. 
I don't wanna get roped into another one of his terrible parties. 
I'm always the only person who shows up. 
Happy halloween,baby. 
How could no one go to ken's party? 
He's such a great dude. 
Will you come,please? 
No,I can'T. 
I only go to a-list events. 
Ohh,I don't wanna be stuck there alone with him again. 
Don't sweat it,'cause I'm gonna bail you out. 
I'm gonna turn ken's jam into a major event. 
Good luck with that. 
See,all a hot party needs is mystique. 
A buzz. 
See,people are like lemmings. 
Harvey lemmings,my lawyer,who never misses a party. 
That's not a real peon. 
You made that up. 
I just have to start a little rumor. 
Who are the biggest gossips on tgs? 
grizz and dotcom. 
So,greenzo,what else can kids and parents do to protect the environment? 
well,kids,you can tell your parents to buy a G.E.Front-loading washing machine to save water. 
'Cause if the earth's not here,where else is greenzo gonna dance? 
Thanks for getting the message out,greenzo. 
You're saving the world. 
Did you hear what mary said about me saving the world? 
Sorry,everybody,that's meredith viera. 
The today show wants to give us a recurring segment now. 
Lemon,I want you to write them up. 
I want the sketches to be punchy and entertaining, so don't treat it like your show. 
All right,but only because I like earth. 
Jared,we'll send you some stuff. 
Oh,I'd like to sit in and give notes. 
Make sure it's got that greenzo voice. 
It's wry and wise,but--but also very sexual. 
Walk with me,Lemon. 
Look how greenzo's testing. 
They love him in every demographic. 
Colored people,broads,fairies,commies. 
Gosh,we gotta update these forms. 
Yeah,well,greenzo seems to love himself too. 
So does don Geiss. 
He sent me a personal card congratulating me. 
With a real signature! 
Wow,if you licked the envelope,you could clone him, and then you'd have two Geisses. 
Yeah,right,Lemon. 
I'm gonna clone Geiss,then compete with a Geiss clone for the ceo position? 
Think it thr Ms.Lemon,mr.Donaghy,I'm just 
a simple pig farmer's son. 
But I would be honored if you'd come to a party at my home. 
Oh,whatever,fine. I'll come. 
Super. Mr.D? 
Uh,no. I could make 
up some excuse,Kenneth, but I have too much respect for you. 
During your party,I'll be home,listening to some schubert. 
And,uh,ironically,viewing some canadian pornography. 
Hope you're ready to party like it's 1999. 
Which,according to my bible,will be in seven years. 
Oh,what is that smell? 
That is the body spray that came with my new leather Jacket. 
Oh,my god. 
Are you having an affair? 
What? No. 
Why would you say that? 
Because you're acting all happy and full of life. 
Liz,you're crazy. 
Yeah,and you're married,remember,pete? 
Your beautiful wife paula. 
And your sons,robert and Jack. 
And that creepy little one who's always rubbing himself against the carpet. 
Liz... I'm not cheating on paula. 
You better not be! 
Oh,great,now I smell like midlife crisis! 
Here's a tip,cerie. 
Decide what you want before you open the refrigerator. 
You just released enough hydro fluorocarbons to kill a penguin. 
This penguin. 
You ever take off that costume? 
You ever take off yours? 
Greenzo out! 
Did he just talk to me like I'm ugly? 
Hey,fellas. 
I heard a secret about Kenneth's party. 
Ken went to high school in georgia with the rapper T.I. 
And,boys... 
T.I.Might show up. 
But listen... 
we can't let anyone know. Anyone! 
Got it? Right. 
****** ******* Never****** ****too I love***** we know ******** Dude******* ********* So******week ****** ******you I****** ******** I mean*******about it ******* Well,Kenneth is having this really,really big party. 
Yes,that's right,you heard me! 
T.I.Is gonna be at Kenneth's party! 
You're my publicist. Get me in! 
Oh,also,could you try to kill that story about my mom being meless? 
I love T.I. 
Please,respect celebrity privacy. 
It's a party? 
Yes,but don't tell anybody. 
That was Geiss's social secretary. What did he say? 
He was talking about some epic party at Kenneth's! 
He claims he needs an invite for mr.Geiss. 
You're saying Geiss might be at Kenneth's party? 
 Our Kenneth? 
 Yes! 
Why would he go to that? 
What else do you know? 
T.I.Is going to be there. 
Bob logan from texas instruments is gonna be there? 
Logan must be in contention for the ceo spot as well. 
Sir,if there's any chance that mr.Geiss is going to be at this party 
Thanks,jonathan. Think 
I should try to go? 
I... 
I've gotta find Kenneth. 
I,uh,haven't had a chance to get to that greenzo stuff yet. 
Hey,did you leave your computer on all night? 
Yeah,it just takes a really long time to reboot in the morning. 
Hey,you know what else takes a long time? 
Building a new earth. 
 Listen,jared  greenzo. 
I'm working with you as a favor. 
You know what? You people make me sick. 
You act like you care,but you do nothing. 
Do you even bother to compost your own feces? 
Look,I got a lot of real work that I have to do right now. 
So I'm not really interested in having some actor lecture me. 
Are you saying actors can't change the world? 
I guess nobody bothered to tell sharon stone. 
Look,I always knew i can make a difference. 
And now I finally have my platform, so l's have a little less yappity yap and a little more kity clack. 
All right,that's it. I'm telling Jack. 
 This is not working. 
 Wait. 
What's in that styrofoam cup,huh? 
The earth's blood? 
 Give me that. 
 No. 
You jag! I just got 
this,like,eight years ago. 
Good job. 
Leave all the lights on for the invisible people. 
Gross! 
 Liz! 
 Paula? 
You're cheating with your wife? 
Why didn't you te me about this! 
That's my fault. 
I get off on the sneakin' around. Who knew,right? 
So how are your parents? 
No,no,no. We'll catch up later. 
I just came to get a clean sweater. 
Why is there a pop-tart in the bed? 
What do you do with the pop-tart? 
Hey,did you hear about Kenneth's insane party? 
T.I.'S gonna be there. 
I'm surprised to hear that because that is new information. 
Yeah,and he's gonna perform. 
He is? 
And fall out boy will be there too. 
And there's gonna be foxy boxing! 
Foxy boxing? I love foxy boxing! 
It combines my two favorite things: Boxing and referees! 
I got to get into that party man. 
Get me harvey lemmings! 
You dummy,first of all,you didn't dial that cell phone. 
Second of all,that is your own rumor. 
People are gonna show up expecting all this great stuff, and they're gonna be disappointed and angry. 
Just like colonial williamsburg. 
You need to nip this in the bud. 
Tell Kenneth what you've done and cancel the party. 
Kenneth,thanks for letting my cousins come to your party. 
I'm just horny to be in New York Hey,Kenneth,you know how much i like to joke around,right? 
Not really,mr.Donaghy. 
Well,before,when I told you i didn't wanna come to your party, I was just kidding! 
Isn't that a fantastic joke? 
I don't understand what's happening. 
Well,the point is that I have good news. 
I may be able to stop by now. 
Oh,mr.Donaghy,you don't 
wanna go to my silly party. 
so that's the way you wanna play this? 
Whip 'em out,measure 'em. 
Kenneth,as an executive vice president at general electric, I'm ordering you to give me one of those pink cupcakes. 
Ld love it if you came to my party. 
Yeah. 
You would. 
Sweet. 
Everyone's coming. 
You're just in time,Lemon. 
Greenzo's segment on the today show is about to begin. 
Yeah,I didn't write anything for that guy. 
He has gone off the deep end. 
You gotta replace hi don't mess with success,Lemon. 
Viewers love green Geiss loves greenzo. 
We're not changing anything. 
Hey,kids,can you hold your breath? 
Good. Now do it forever. 
'Cause the air is gonna be poisoned unless we switch to green technology. 
Sold by our company. 
I love this guy. 
You know,greenzo,I read that television sets actually draw power even when they're turned off. 
Meredith just taught us a very important lesson,kids. 
It's rude to interrupt people. 
Can greenzo get real here for a second? 
Did you know that there are people out there with the power to heal mother gaia, but they're paralyzed by greed? 
I'm talking about big companies and their two-faced,fat cat executives. 
What is he doing? 
Stay calm. 
Did you kids know that we could actually end global warming in five years, if we just raised taxes on the super-rich by just 2%? 
Wow,is that true? 
It doesn't matter if it's true. 
He works for that money. 
We've lost control of greenzo. 
I knew we should have gone with angie harmon. 
kill trees? 
Hey,Liz. 
Look,obviously what happened in your bed last night was a violation. 
So much hair. 
Sorry,she likes me natural. 
Listen,I am glad that you're back with paula. 
But when are you moving out? 
No,no,no,Liz. I can't move out. 
Look,paula and I got married our sophomore year. 
She was pregnant 20 minutes into the first date. 
This is the first chance we've had to just... be a couple. 
And our relationship has never been better. 
We did it on your kitchen table. 
I shouldn't have told you that. 
Liz,please. 
Please let me be your roommate so I can date my wife. 
Oh,I can't believe i'm saying this. 
 Okay. 
 Yes! 
Oh,Liz,you're the best. 
Oh,hey,could you come home early tonight? 
Paula wants to get caught again. 
Got it. 
Hey,you catch me on today,Jack? 
Mary was totally digging me. 
Dude,have you hit that? 
Jared,I'm a little concerned that we're losing our message here. 
It's non-judgmental,business-friendly. 
Oh,no,no,no,no. We're 
way past that,Jack. 
While you're out there destroying the earth,I'll be saving it. 
And history will remember me. 
When I die,they'll wanna put my face on money. 
If there were money in the future instead of just hugs. 
Okay,you listen to me,redzo. 
You either get on board,or you're gonna wake up on that island with phil donahue and the electric car. 
You understand me? 
I made you what you are. 
No,I've always been greenzo. 
You're crazy. 
And you're fired. 
Really? 
Can you fire the wind,Jack? 
Can you fire a hurricane? 
We're developing that technology! 
hey,Liz,you going to Kenneth's party? 
Is this party still on? 
Oh,it better be. 
The harlem globetrotters are gonna be there. 
The girl from heroes is gonna take a shower. 
Now Jack is going to this party?This is nuts 
you said you were gonna shut it down. 
I couldn'T. This means too much to ken. 
And when everyone shows up and it sucks? 
It's not going to. 
This party's about to become a tracy jordan joint! 
And what does that entail? 
Here we go! 
I've called this meeting to discuss what happened last night at Kenneth's party. 
******Kiss me. 
We all went in with certain expectations. 
The evening took a nasty left turn. 
Now we must face certain facts in the cold light of day. 
Y'all should be ashamed of yourselves. 
Mr.Lutz,you ate all my 
parakeet's medication. 
And thanks to you,sonny crockett has been having seizures all morning. 
Mr.Hornberger,I would thank you to 
come pick up your wife at some point. 
Mr.Jordan,I saw you steal my sink. 
Harlem globetrotter... 
does that name mean nothing to you? 
And ms.Lemon. 
I will have you know that before last night, I had never,ever seen grizz or dotcom cry. 
I'm sorry. 
I want you all to think about what you did. 
Congratulations. 
You were all present at Kenneth parcell's last party ever. 
Mr.Donaghy,uh... 
they are ready for you downstairs. 
I'm gonna,uh... 
need a moment. 
What is this for? 
The today show was expecting another green segment. 
Don Geiss is expecting it. 
It's gonna happen. 
But you fired jared,so who's gonna... 
oh,my god. That's al gore. 
Is he gonna be the new greenzo? 
Uh,not exactly. 
I may have gotten him here under false pretenses. 
Hey,Jack,good to see you again. 
Mr.Vice president. 
Hi,how are you? 
I'm Lemon. 
So I'm excited to see this trash-powered car of yours. 
How do you two even know each other? 
We met when Jack was an intern for senator ted kennedy. 
Let me tell ya,Jack was the most liberal guy The thing is,the G.E.Garbage 
car isn't quite ready yet. 
But while you're here,what do you say you throw on a pair of green tights and a cape, and tell the kids how big business is good for the environment? 
I have no interest in doing that. 
Al,we're with you on this whole planet thing. 
I mean,look at the set we built with the smiley-face earth and some green things. 
Jack,look,we're way beyond that. 
If your network really wants to demonstrate a commitment to the environment, why don't you start by,for example, having an entire week with nothing but environmental themes on all the programs? 
Use entertainment for substance. 
You could have a character in prime time making a passionate argument to the american people that we need co2 taxes to replace the payroll taxes. 
Your parent company could lobby congress and the president to pass the treaty and save the climate. 
Yes,or... 
you could put on a silly hat and tell the kids how outsourcing means cheaper toys at christmas. 
This is not working for me,Jack. 
All right,let's do this! 
Jared,what are you doing here? 
Al gore? 
What's up? 
Jared,it's time for you to go. 
No,no! 
The show must go on! 
Back off,Jack! 
Or you'll be greenzoed! 
You'll all be greenzoed! 
Jared! Jared! 
I--I am so sorry,mr.Vice president. 
 This all started when Jack- - Quiet! 
A whale is in trouble. 
I have to go. 
Give it to me Oh,boy,okay. This earth is 
ruined!We gotta get a new one. 
On my stage? No way. 
Oh,hey there, little guy. 
What the hell? We have rehearsal. 
 He can't tell me  no,no,no,no,no the most important thing is to know who you can trust and who you can't trust, and that man cannot be trusted. 
What are you worrying about? You have the job. 
It's not over till it's over. The game is still on... 
and nobody plays it like banks. 
Stay clear of him, little buddy. 
Then after you carbonate it, you drink it! 
Sounds like soda pop. 
Damn it! Why is leaving your children 
a legacy that'll live forever so hard? 
It's been almost half an hour. 
Maybe we should take a break,mr. Jordan. 
Yeah,I need to clear my thoughtcicles. 
Which one of my two favorite pastimes shall I indulge in? 
Video games or pornography! 
THICK THIGHS/ARMY GAME OF DEATH That's it! Make a porn video game! 
Hey,liz. Ight? 
where's your buddy jack? 
Packing up his office? 
I don't know anything about jack, so you're wasting your time. 
So you don't know about him accidentally selling nbc to some germans? 
 Uh,no. 
 Really? 
'Cause rumor has it that he's trying to pull a death spiral: Inflating the company's value, shorting his own stock and then making a killing. 
What--no,that's completely not true. 
Jack was nowhere near that meeting. 
He wasn't even in new york 'cause he was off with his girlfriend leaving me in charge, so take that,liz. 
Oh,god. That was so easy. 
Like taking candy from one of those guys who gives out candy at gay night clubs. 
Oh,my god. Please don't say 
anything. I'll give you kenneth. 
Well,as enticing as that is, I'm straight now. 
I think that my future father-in-law needs to hear about jack's little career killer. 
Well,then he'll also need to know about the security camera footage of you cheating on his daughter with another woman. 
What? 
No. No! No! No! 
Oh,god! 
You loved it! 
A porn video game? It can't be done. 
Look,tre, history's greatest perverts have tried: Walt disney,larry flynt, the japanese, but they can't do it because of the uncanny valley. 
Let me show you something. 
Check out this chart. 
You see, as artificial representations of humans become more and more realistic, they reach a point where they stop being endearing and become creepy. 
Tell it to me in star wars. 
All right,we like r2d2 and c3po. 
They're nice. 
And up here we have a real person like han solo. 
He acts like he doesn't care, but he does. 
But down here we have a cgi storm trooper or tom hanks in the polar express. 
I'm scared! Get me out of there! 
That's the problem. 
You're in the valley now and it's impossible to get out. 
That's where you're wrong. 
I was born to design a video game where characters get weird with each other for golden points. 
My genius will not be denied. 
I'm like mozart. 
You're like that guy that was always jealous of mozart. 
Salieri? 
No,thank you. I already ate. 
You will not deter me. 
The world is gonna remember the name tracy jordan. 
Well played,lemon. 
To get through it, I pretended he was a sandwich. 
It's good to have you in my corner. 
Hey,you know, I've always got your back. 
Lemon, where do you see yourself in five years? 
Realistically,teaching improv on cruise ships. 
Lemon,I'm promoting you to head of east coast television and microwave oven programming. 
What? When did you get microwaves back? 
You're going to be my successor. 
No--no,I'm not an executive. 
Executives are,like, huh-huh-huh. And I'm,like, haa. 
I mean,I'm a creative person. 
Sure,there are times when my job is frustrating, like when lutz calls in sick with march madness, but I mostly love it. 
This is the starting salary. 
Suck it,monkeys! I'm goin' corporate! 
Word is the board is meeting later this week. 
Guys must be close to making a decision. 
I wouldn't know anything about that. 
He guys,let's change the subject to sucking at golf, so donaghy has something to talk about. 
I'm sorry about that. 
I'm a little nervous. 
Don't apologize. You're a natural. 
I'm feeling pretty drunk. 
Well it's business drunk. 
It's like rich drunk. 
Either way,it's legal to drive. 
all right,gentlemen, we should do some work. 
You suck,stan! 
As you know, we've sunk a lot of money into developing this new microwave start button. 
It's been four years and $10 million. 
I think it's time we pull the trigger. 
What do you think? 
I kind of like the old button. 
Button classic. I love it. 
Button classic? It's hip and homey. 
Oh,my god,guys. We're crushing it! 
Your first executive decision and you've already saved this company $2 million in future r and D. 
 But what if I'm wrong? 
 There is no wrong. 
Lemon,you just have to find a subordinate you can push the blame onto. 
That's why I love jorgenson here. 
I think you're ready to meet the old man. 
 Jeez,jack,offer to buy a girl dinner first. 
 classic lemon! 
I've never seen you like this,mr. Jordan. 
This project is consuming you. 
No,for the first time in my life i know my purpose. 
I'm doing this for my children. 
My genius has come alive, like toys when your back is turned. 
I see the potential for erotica in everything around me. 
This cup,this table... 
even you,kenneth. 
Well,I am wearing a cuffed trouser today. 
Tracy,what are you doing? 
They need you in wardrobe. 
I'm inventing a porn video game. 
Let this man work! No 
one is to disturb him! 
Don't hold your breath, pete. 
It can't be done or else i would've solved it a long time ago. 
Yeah,I would have. 
Hey,nerds!Guess who's got two 
thumbs, speaks limited french, and hasn't cried once today? This moi. 
Liz. 
You can't be serious about going off with donaghy. 
How can you abandon me like this? 
No,I'm gonna promote you outta here. 
You're gonna be an executive! 
I don't want to be an executive. 
This is your starting salary. 
I know. 
Uh,don. 
I'd like you to meet liz lemon. 
Aren't you the gal who pioneered the button classic campaign? 
That was me! 
Where the hell has donaghy been hiding you? 
Oh,my blood sugar is dropping. 
Liz,sweetie,can you run out to the dessert table and get me something? 
Oh,sure,but you should know that I work for tips. 
You got the charm and spark of a young leona helmsley. 
Is that-- is he finished? 
Not yet, but don't disturb him. 
He can't keep going like this. 
He was up for six hours straight. 
My god. He's a genius. 
Ugh,look at that loser, sitting all alone and sad. 
He's like me yesterday. I hate him. 
Oh,I don't know, lemon. I'm actually 
starting to feel sorry for the poor bastard. 
Hoo,boy,got your period? 
Business drunk! More 
business juice, please! 
Oh,right--geiss! 
So are you enjoying the party? 
Wha--how could I not be? 
Just can't wait to take this sexual energy back to kathy. 
Banks,don't do this. Don't marry kathy. 
 It may not be worth it. 
 Why not? 
We're absolutely perfect for each other. 
She loves that I work out a lot and talk to people. 
And I love how she enjoys crawling into cabinets and vents and other enclosed spaces. 
Like behind the dryer, for instance. 
You don't really love this woman. 
Look how miserable you are at your own bachelor party. 
That's not why I'm miserable, you idiot. 
I'd marry 1,000 kathy geisses to be ceo. 
I'm miserable because I know that I'm not getting it. Yeah. 
Geiss told me that it was gonna be you,jack. 
At my own sham bachelor party. 
Mr. Geiss,I'm sorry it took so long. 
Mr. Geiss? 
Oh,blurgh! 
So go ahead,donaghy. Rub it in my face. 
Normally I'd say, "I bet you'd like that," but today I won'T. 
Devin, I'm the only other person who understands what you were willing to do for this job and how devastated you must be that you're not going to get it. 
It's like when christian won project runway even though rami was clearly the better draper. 
Oh,god. I've got to 
call this wedding off. 
Devin, I just want you to know... 
I hate-respect you. 
And I you. 
I think geiss is dead. 
We've got to call dr. Spaceman. 
Duet becomes a trio. 
A trio becomes a quartet. 
And on and on. Do you have it? 
You go too fast! 
I've given my whole life to porn and he does it in one day! One day! 
What's wrong with him,leo? 
Well,to the untrained eye, he'd appear to be what we in the medical community call "sleeping." 
But he is,in fact, in a diabetic coma, which could've been avoided by what we call "eating." 
Do whatever you can,leo. 
He has to wake up. 
Okay. This is the gross part. 
Ew,almost done. 
Almost done Oh,damn it. That shot 
was just a placebo. 
I was hoping this was psychological. 
He may not be faking it for attention. 
Jack,have you seen don? 
Oh,boy, that doesn't look good. 
Don't panic,jorgenson. 
It's under control. 
He just has to say one sentence. 
Couldn't you just,you know, inject something right into his heart? 
Oh,I'd love to, but we have no way of knowing where the heart is. 
See,every human is different. 
 Jack. 
 It's okay. 
Don isn't feeling well. 
He's in a diabetic coma. 
 But possibly faking. 
 How did this happen? 
It was jorgenson's fault! 
Fair enough. 
It's all right. I'm in charge now. 
You see,yesterday i met with don and he said I'm going to become his successor. 
So I'm the ceo. 
Jack,if this is a power grab, it's in very bad taste. 
No,no,he said it. He told 
me to keep it a secret. 
No,it's true. I heard 
it secondhand from jack. 
banks! Banks knows. He can back me up. 
Jack... 
jack,I don't know what you're talking about. 
Oh,daddy! Daddy,no! Daddy! 
Is it 4-1-1 or 9-1-1? 
Uh,new york. Uh,diabetes 
repair, I guess. 
jack,I know you're mad at me. 
Lemon,I am not mad at you. 
Look,tgs is really where i belong. 
 I'm not cut out to be an executive. 
 Nonsense. 
Granted,you almost killed don geiss. 
But let's not forget, button classic. 
Right,button classic. I crushed that. 
So we both had a mixed day. That's business. 
Today the board is meeting and I am still their best candidate. 
And after I state my case, I'm sure they will want to fulfill don geiss's pre-coma wish. 
Oh,okay,great. Because I 
don't think i can return this 'cause I got business sick all over it when I got home. 
Get out of here,banks. 
I have nothing to say to you before this meeting. 
Then I'll do the talking for the both of us. 
Whaddaya mean,banks? 
I'll tell you,jack. 
There is no meeting today. 
See,I convinced the board to have an emergency meeting last night. 
I tried to call you, but not on a phone, so you may not have heard me. 
Devin,what did you do? 
I did what's best for the company. 
You see,I convinced them it was best to act quickly to quell any fears among investors. 
And everyone agreed that, for the sake of continuity, the geiss family's steady hand should remain on the wheel. 
Of course,kathy's gonna need some guidance, but that's what her fianc? s for. 
No,this can't happen. 
Oh,it's happening. 
Now get out of our office. 
I didn't hear hand washing! 
This is it, Lemon. Government.  
The true seat of American power.  
This is all happening so fast.  
I mean, last week you were at ge, and this week you're what are you in charge of exactly? 
We're sharing the load. It's 
a bit of homeland security.  
they still have that? 
Extreme weather preparedness and the war on the poor.  
You mean the war on poverty.  
Yeah, okay, let's go with that.  
So you're never coming back.  
I'm sorry, Lemon, but there's nothing left for me at ge.  
Sure, Geiss could come out of the coma and say,  "Jackie boy, you're the next ceo, " but that's not likely.  
The cryogenecists are already sharpening their head saws.  
Oh, this is all so weird.  
It's making me sick to my stomach.  
Lemon, it's 8:00 in the morning.  
Are you eating those Mexican cheese curls? 
Hey, don�t knock my �Sabor de Soledad�.  
I found a prize in here the other day... I hope.  
Lemon, I have to go.  
It's time for my freedom search.  
Liz Lemon, do these look like wizard nipples to you? 
Well, I don�t know. Are the  
lightning bolts suppos *** in or out? 
Exactly. Is all wrong. 
This world is so clear in my head. 
oh, are these the characters for your porn video game? 
The working title is goregasm, colon,  the legend of dong-slayer.  
sorry about the wizard, Tracy.  
I'll call the Korean animators.  
Yeah, you fixulate this! 
I'm sorry.  
Liz Lemon, do you know what it's like to be the only one who cares about your job when everybody else around is goofing off like a bunch of goof-offs? 
Yes.  
Emotions.  
 You having your woman times? 
 What? No! 
I just had my woman times last-- oh, boy.  
proudly presents 30 Rock  Season02 Episode15 why don�t I cross out the days like people in the movies? 
I think you're supposed to take all of them. Like, in a row.  
Thank you, cerie, but I've been sexually active since I was 25.  
Mr.Hornberger? 
I was wondEring if I could ask you to write a recommendation for me to be a page at the x-x-I-x summer olympics in Beijing.  
Sure, Kenneth.  
Have you ever wanted to go to the olympics, Mr.Hornberger? 
I almost went once.  
Bad news, archers.  
President carter has decided to boycott the Moscow games.  
Peanut farmer.  
Anyway, I was wondEring when you were gonna come to me for this.  
You know the applications are due today.  
Today, sir? 
The memo I got said they were due in two weeks.  
No, it's today at 5:00.  
I have to write my personal essay! 
Donny? 
Parcell. Thought you'd be 
coming out of that door.  
Did you get my memo about the olympic applications being due two weeks from now? 
Saboteur! 
Looks like you'll be staying here in New York all summer fighting the crowds,  smelling the hot garbage,  while I travel to beautiful, breezy Beijing.  
The day's not over yet.  
Hey, you must be Jack Donaghy.  
Cooter berger, vice chair of farm subsidies, acting head of fema,  temporary acting head of the fbc while the acting head is on trial.  
Wow, you've had a lot of shake ups around here lately, huh? 
I couldn�t disagree with you more.  
The administration has been streamlined.  
And the media are so obsessed with the current election, they've completely forgotten we're here.  
It's an exciting time.  
I'm glad to hear it. I don�t like to 
think of this president as a lame duck.  
I like to think of him as a lame eagle.  
The ceiling appears to be leaking.  
No, it's not. We've looked 
into it and it's not.  
If you have any questions, I'll write down my extension for you.  
Do you need a pen? 
Nope, I've kind of gotten used to it.  
You don�t have pens? 
We're not in a recession.  
Boy, we've got to crack the whip around here, cooter.  
You don�t have pens.  
The roof is leaking.  
No, it's not. I'll show you the study.  
Hey, we have a meeting with the appropriations committee, like, now.  
Oh, no, I'm not prepared.  
I know. I'm not drunk 
either. But we'll manage.  
Mother! 
oh, I'm sorry.  
I don�t know why I even came up here.  
I mean, I know Jack's not here.  
Boy, I am really going a little crazy! 
I don�t supposed you want to be my sounding board.  
You're busy. I'll 
come back another time.  
Warrior, you have defeated the snake elf.  
Now join me in the orgy chamber.  
The poets will sing of this night.  
Stop, stop! It's not working.  
It's not--not you, grizz.  
You're doing great.  
I memorized all my lines at home.  
But, Jenna, you're not doing good acting.  
Don�t overthink it. I don�t need 
another judi dench situation.  
Now let's just skip ahead to the list of player sensuality options.  
These avatars need to be able to do anything to each other.  
Touch my cheek.  
 Touch my chest area.  
 Now give me a little robot.  
 Touch my butt.  
 Now like it's a secret.  
Touch my knees.  
 Sexy, yes.  
 Touch my knee spot.  
 Good.  
 Touch my feet with your knees! 
Now that we're in the zone, I want you to give me some random sex sounds.  
wonderful, wonderful. Let's 
take it again from the top.  
This time, let's record! 
Hey, Jack, it's Liz.  
Um, maybe you're busy spreading democracy. Anyway, give me a call.  
Things are happening! 
Our first order of business,  the city of portland has requested $9 million to shore up its dam system.  
I can�t support that.  
"Damn" is a swear word.  
I'd support it if instead of dam we called it a "god finger. " 
Randall, must you bring religion into everything? 
We need pens.  
Excuse me? 
Gentlemen, madame, we all know that rome wasn�t built in a day.  
Well, that's one theory.  
But. . .  
we have a chance to make this country great again.  
We need hope. We need change.  
We need experience.  
We need pens.  
Kenneth, where have you been? 
I had to put on my jeans by myself.  
I'm sorry, miss Maroney.  
I'm trying to finish this application for Beijing.  
Did someone say "donny?" 
 No.  
 No.  
Oh, it's pretty muffled in there.  
You'll never get that application done in time, Parcell.  
You should just give up! 
I will not fail, Chief Errand Boy Donny Lawson! 
I was told there would be no nudity! 
That's the only thing i know how to say in chinese.  
Four and a half hours, hee-haw.  
Donny's right.  
I'll never finish this application in time.  
The personal essay is way harder than I thought,  'cause it' not in my nature rag on myself.  
Not even a backdoor brag? 
What's a backdoor brag? 
It's sneaking something wonderful about yourself into everyday conversation.  
Like when I tell people it's hard for me to watch "American Idol" because I have perfect pitch.  
Now you try.  
It's hard for me to watch "American Idol" because there's a water bug on my channel changer.  
It's no just? 
Oh, no.  
Someone's gonna get more attention than me.  
That was amazing.  
"Give us pens. " I mean, how do you do it? 
Cooter, I used to work for a man named don Geiss.  
He taught me how to be proactive.  
I'm going to teach you the same thing.  
I'm so happy you're here.  
I haven�t felt this energized at work since the two weeks where they tried to teach us farsi.  
 Cool phone.  
 Excuse me.  
Jonathan.  
 Geiss spoke.  
 What? 
He's not out of the coma, but he spoke.  
What did he say? 
He said, "Jackie boy. " 
Cooter, this is my letter of resignation.  
Would you make sure that it gets into the right hands? 
What? No, no way.  
What do you want to do that for? 
I just received a very important phone call. I've gotta get back.  
But we were gonna do great things together.  
Look, the leak's stopped.  
I have to get back to new york. This is my only chance.  
Resignation denied.  
You can�t deny my resignation.  
Actually, I can.  
As acting head of the fbc, I oversee the ewpc, and I'm denying your resignation.  
You'll stay here and serve your country.  
The head of ge serves this country.  
He provides jobs. Fuels innovation.  
He brings good things to light.  
Cooter, I'm begging you. Please let me go.  
Hey, it's not up to me.  
Even if I let you resign, my boss wouldn�t.  
They don�t want people leaving here anymore.  
You're not going anywhere, buddy! 
Hey, the pens are here! 
USA! USA! USA! USA! 
Hello, friend.  
 Oh, my god, you're pregnant.  
 What? 
Yes. How can you tell? 
I just can.  
People always underestimate my instincts because of my looks.  
This is no time for backdoor bragging.  
I'm just so happy for you.  
 This is what you wanted.  
 Yeah, but not like this.  
Why not like this, Liz? 
As my mom used to say, "you never want this to happen. " 
 Have you called Floyd yet? 
 What? 
Floyd--you couldn�t ask for a better guy to make a mistake with.  
Oh, no. It is Floyd, right? 
Those margaritas were strong.  
Can you come inside? I need 
a couple light bulbs changed.  
Pfft, yeah! 
oh, my god.  
How could you have slept with Dennis? 
It was before he tried to throw me under the subway train.  
Oh, my god! 
Oh, so you're the only person in the world that's allowed to make sex mistakes? 
You had a three-way with Roseanne and tom Arnold.  
That was two years ago.  
Fine, so I made one extremely unfortunate coupling decision.  
So what are you gonna do? 
Well, obviously Dennis can�t be involved because he is a class "a" moron.  
So I am just gonna be a kick-ass single mom.  
Like Erin Brockovich or Sarah Connor.  
Listen to you. 
You're actually excited about this.  
Yeah, I am.  
Even though it's Dennis',  I must really want a kid.  
Go to the doctor and get a blood test so you know for sure.  
And while you're there,  try get me some adderall.  
I'm trapped here. I can�t believe this.  
Well, I can�t believe the best friend I've ever had would try and leave me.  
Cooter, look at this place.  
This can�t be what you want in life.  
Haven�t you ever thought of leaving? 
Of course. Every day.  
Every day for two years.  
Look at these resignation letters.  
They're written in ketchup,  dirty rock, leak water.  
And now you're here. You're here 
and everything's gonna be better.  
Now we've got pens. Glorious pens! 
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. They're caps.  
Nothing but caps.  
 Cooter  that's not my name! 
My name is James Reilly.  
Cooter berger? What do you 
think I am, a cartoon dog? 
The president named me that.  
He gave you two nicknames? 
"Cooter" because I look like a turtle and "berger" because he saw me eating a hamburger one time.  
We have toet out of here.  
Now that's the spirit.  
But if they're not taking resignations, there's only one way out.  
We have to work together to get fired.  
It wasn�t even a hamburger.  
It was a sandwich.  
 Hello, Elizabeth.  
 Dennis, what are you doing here? 
I don�t have to explain myself to you.  
Look, I told my mom I got a job,  so I've been coming here for the past couple weeks during the day.  
 What? 
 How come you're not at work? 
Because foot my computer no, why am I-- this is my apartment.  
 There something you want to tell me? 
 No.  
Elizabeth, this is Melinda from Dr. Bouvier's office.  
We'll try to reach you again later.  
I know that message and I know that tone.  
Every one of my sisters got that message junior year in high school-- you're pregnant! 
 What? No! 
 Really? All right.  
Prnatal vitamins. Yeah, I 
know what "prenatal" means.  
Pre, "before";  Natal, "ruined". 
 Oh, my god.  
 All right, first things first.  
We're gonna have this baby at the same hospital i was born at on Coney Island. All right? 
Oh, my god! 
Secondly, if it's a boy, we're gonna name him Morpheus like that guy in the Matrix.  
If it's a girl--ooh, yeah.  
I used to boff this chick named Judy, and I would love to honor her.  
Get out of my apartment.  
Don�t talk to me like that.  
 Morpheus hears everything that you say.  
 Out! 
Your boobs are gonna get bigger.  
You must have been such a pretty monkey.  
What's that, miss Maroney? 
It's your personal essay, Kenneth.  
Ohhello. I didn�t see you there.  
I was just thinking about my friend, Kenneth Parcell,  and how much he personifies the olympic spirit.  
He's involved in charity work.  
 You needed me, miss Maroney? 
 Yes.  
Kenneth, can you take this money to the many charities I support anonymously? 
Of course. Oh, miss 
Maroney, this is empt he knows the importance of physical fitness.  
I mean, he can lift almost 100 pounds1 * Mind, body, spirit Kenneth, * * I see myself in you * * so brave * * so ready to be all that you can do * * so beautiful in every way * * I see myself in you * miss Maroney, thank you! 
I have 20 minutes. I'm gonna make it! 
I see myself in you.  
Oh, Kenneth, someone was looking for you.  
They need 12 boxes of copier paper on stage one.  
Duty before self.  
I will not fail you, Rainbow Chicken.  
whatever we come up with has gotta be wasteful,  embarrassing to tion, and upsetting to the voters.  
Holy smoke! 
What have you got? 
In 1994, the pentagon explored the possibility of a non-lethal chemical weapon thque,  uce enemy soldiers coosture by making them totally gay-nes for eaer. " 
How gay? 
It doesn�t say. The project was 
abandoned in the planning stages.  
Of course it was.  
It would've been expensive, impractical,  and offensive to both the red states and the gayer blue states.  
This is exactly what we're looking for.  
A guaranteed disaster.  
Like eating a burrito before sex.  
But where would we get the money? 
No congressman in his right mind would support this.  
Don�t worry, I've got a friend in congress.  
But not your best friend, right? 
Yo, Frank.  
Oh, my god.  
Is that yes. It's just the prototype.  
But I want you to be the first to play it.  
 Tell me what you think.  
 This is such an honor.  
I got anadal filth by" credit.  
You earnt.  
Good job, Parcell.  
Too bad it cost you a trip to China.  
Wait a minute. Who's this paper for? 
No one! 
Looks like you only have 30 seconds to get your application to the 27th floor.  
And you're not gonna make it.  
Run, Kenneth, run! 
Oh, mommy! 
He knows! 
Oh, god, call me, Jack! This is a disaster.  
This baby's gonna have a father.  
Look out! 
What? 
A gay bomb? 
You dragged me out of a meeting for this? 
I was gonna meet bono.  
C. C. -- Representative 
cunningham.  
We'll keep this professional.  
I did certain things for you in bed that you were going to reciprocate,  but then we broke up before my birthday.  
So you owe me.  
This could take weeks to get approved.  
I'll take my chances.  
And that would mean I'd be spending my birthday here, so. . .  
all right, I will help you ged.  
Yes! I am so on a roll.  
No crying in my bath tonight.  
hey, Jack, it's Liz.  
Um, maybe you're busy spreading democracy.  
Anyway, give me a call.  
Things are happening! 
Hey, it's Liz Lemon. Funny story.  
I think I'm pregnant with Dennis Duffy's baby.  
Thought you'd be super proud.  
Oh, in a way, it's what I wanted.  
Yeah, it's gonna be fine.  
He knows! Oh, god, call 
me, Jack! This is a disaster.  
This baby's gonna have a father! 
What--Kenneth just did a flip into the elevator! 
Jack, I've spent the last hour looking at cribs online.  
It's crazy. Even with all this Dennis 
stuff all I can think about is baby hair and converting my laundry and newspaper pile into a nursery.  
So I don�t want you to worry about me, because, um, I'm happy.  
Oh, and yes, you hear me eating �Sabor de Soledad� 'cause I can eat whatever I want now.  
Oh, hang on. That's my doctor.  
Never mind. I am 
not, um-- never mind.  
Lemon, how are you? 
 It was the cheese curls.  
 Pardon? 
Causing the false positives on my home pregnancy tests.  
Apparently, �Sabor de Soledad� gets its special tangy flavor from evaporated bull semen.  
Oh, that explains your hair's thickness and shine.  
I guess in Mexico women use it to stop their periods before cinco de mayo.  
I'm a little afraid to ask if you're still eating them.  
They're so good.  
Lemon, I'm sorry you had to go through this by yourself.  
No, it's okay.  
I was actually ready to have Dennis Duffy's baby.  
I guess I'm getting to that age where I don�t care what anybody thinks of me.  
If you're going to want to get a very short haircut, resist that urge.  
And I know now that I'm definitely ready.  
I want to adopt.  
Are you sure? What about 
artificial insemination? 
No, I can�t go to a sperm bank.  
The Duffy men use those like atms.  
Then, Lemon. . . I want to assist you.  
What? 
With an adoption! Oh, good 
lord, Lemon! With an adoption.  
I know a lot of well-connected people.  
Okay then, yeah. Help me, thanks.  
Um, how was your day? 
Oh, it was good.  
The president gave me a nickname.  
The Jacker.  
Yeah.  
Three Months Later The Pentagon Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that the gay bomb could not be effectively weaponized.  
The chemical dissipates harmlessly in open tactical environments.  
And Frankly, could only work if somehow we could get the enemy into a closed, unventilated space.  
Ooh, pens! 
I feel weird.  
Let's do this.  
30 Rockefeller Center Dude, I played this thing for a couple hours.  
It's okay, I guess.  
Frank, you've been in your office for three months What? 
Yes, I'm gonna be a billionaire! 
Hey,I wanted to come say merry christmas before we all leave for the break. 
Oh,thank you,lemon. 
That's very thoughtful. 
Help yourself to a gift. 
It's our new handheld photo scanner/paper shredder. 
Oh,well,won't people just end up shredding their photos? 
No,no,it's very to use. 
If you want to pto-scan,you flip the stc.S. 
And if you want to paper shred,you flip the switch to I'd like to make an announcement! 
I just want to say that I'm really sorry for whatever I'm going to do at the party tonight. 
And I forgive all of you in advance for leaving me passed out by the elevator in my own gravy. 
Merry ludachristmas,everyone! 
Are you gonna do horny santa again,frank? 
That was so funny last year when I sat on your lap. 
Yes,funny. 
So big plans for the holidays? 
Yeah,my parents are coming with my brother, and we're gonna go see jersey boys on broadway. 
And we're gonna go to that restaurant where they pretend it's mars. 
God,you must be a ball of anxiety right now. 
No,I'm really excited. 
What are you trying to say,lemon? 
That your family's perfect and you never fight? 
No,I remember them arguing a lot during the gas crisis of '79. 
But since carter left office,it's been pretty smooth sailing. 
You got that right. 
So is your mom coming up from florida? 
No,I invited her out of my paralyzing irish guilt, but her plane was grounded because of hurricane zapato. 
Look at that! 
That's where she lives. 
Jupiter,the eye of the storm So are you alone for christmas? 
No,I was gonna drive up to vermont and surprise C.C. 
Sir! 
Your mother is here. 
She took a bus to atlanta. 
She got jet blue to accept an amtrak ticket.  Tell her I'm 
jingle bells,jingle bells,jingle bells surprise! 
It's your mother. Merry christmas. 
Jack... 
isn't this the office you had before? 
I thought you were up for a big promotion. 
I am,mother,and there are only two nicer offices in the whole building. 
Only two? I don't like the odds. 
I think you better let that dream go. 
Hello,liz! 
What the hell was th? 
It's a message on my phone from a friend. 
Oh,jackie,please. Who is she? 
Her name is C.C. 
Is she spanish? 
What if she was,? 
She's very smart,colleen. 
You'd like her. 
My thanks to the peanut gallery. 
Jack,this coat isn't going to take itself off. 
proudly presents 30 Rock Season02 Episode09 Ludachristmas is tonight? 
Well,I guess I can make it. 
I just hope i don't get drunk and sing christmas carols like I did last year. 
Well,I'm not going,because my parents and my brother mitch are in town. 
Mitch is here? 
 Yes. 
For those of you who don't know my brother, mitch was in a skiing accident his senior year of high school, and he has what's called trauma-induced niveaphasia. 
Basically he's just stuck in the day before his accident. 
Oh,tomorrow's the big day! 
It's gonna be totally rad! 
Yeah,mitch,rad! 
He thinks it's 1985. So if 
you meet him,just be cool. 
It should be mentioned that sexually mitch is very much an adult. 
No,it should not be mentioned. 
Merry christmas from sheinhart-universal,everyone. 
Merry christmas. 
 Thank you! 
Merry christmas. 
Merry jewish. 
Merry christmas. 
What is this? 
It's a ps-575 photo shredder. 
Well,that's not the christmas spirit. 
Christmas is about gratitude and togetherness. 
Sitting with friends and family around a crackling fire waiting for the owl meat to cook. 
Sometimes I don't think you people understand christmas at all. 
Hi,I think I'm early. 
I'm here to have christmas meats eaten off my chest at some party. 
Merry christmas,ms. Lemon. 
Oh,thank you,kenneth. 
Well,fancy suits. How was court? 
Not great,beth. 
Oh,you really were in court? 
all tray had to do was sign his community service papers. 
But he makes a stop for breakfast first. 
So it's my fault diners can serve alcohol in new york state? 
That's on me now? 
Now I have to wear this for 30 days. 
Oh,my goodness. 
If I even had a drop of alcohol in my sweat, a signal goes to ankle bracelet headquarters in denver,and I go to jail. 
And now? This 
time of the year? 
Ludachristmas? 
Nude year's eve? 
Martin luther king day? 
All you do is drink. 
No,tracy,you are not going to ludachristmas.  But 
the three of you are in charge of keeping him from drinking. 
Okay. But who's 
project manager? 
Hmm,that bad,huh? 
Oh,these aren't for me. 
I'm sending them to my mother's hotel room because the room service there is too salty. 
Family stuff can be tough. 
Lemon party! 
Permission to land! 
Permission granted! 
There's my baby! 
Hey,liz,you want to go skiing up at piper's peak tomorrow? 
It's gonna be rad. 
Psych! You can't go! 
It's the senior class trip! 
Oh,psych! You 
got me,mitch! 
Jack,these are my parents. 
Dick lemon. This 
is my boy mitch. 
And my first wife margaret. 
First and last,hi! 
 Jack donaghy. 
You are a very,very handsome man. 
He looks like an arrow shirt model. 
So,jack,is this beautiful genius the best employee you've ever had or what? 
No. 
I like this guy's honesty. 
Yeah,me too. 
Show us what you've been working on... 
wilma shakespeare. 
Oh,I'm just so proud of you. 
Oh,you boota boota boota! 
Nice to meet you,sir. 
 Yeah. 
Would you wrap these up and send them to the ritz-carlton,please? 
Oh,my goodness! 
Look at this! 
They built all of this because of your words you wrote. 
Thank you,thank you. 
Hey,liz,guess who's going skiing with me? 
Chris stanek,your boyfriend! 
Aw,what? Shut up! 
I don't like him! Boys are gross! 
Did you hear that chris stanek got divorced? 
When? Is he dating again? 
lemon,could I have a word with you for a moment? 
Oh,excuse me. 
Is,uh,everything okay? 
 Yeah,why? 
Your family is strange. 
Oh,mitch? No,he was in a skiing 
accident,and he thinks it's 1985. 
No,I get it. I'm talking 
about your parents. 
What did your mother mean when she said that you were a beautiful genius? 
Was she taunting you? 
No,they're just super supportive. 
They've always been like that. 
Even I when I sued the lower white haven school district to let girls play football. 
Hut! 
Feminism! 
What? 
We didn't make the playoffs that year,but I think we led the league in bravery. 
My god,I've never seen such relentless blind encouragement. 
No wonder you're a sexually frightened know-it-all. 
hey,dad,take my picture,look. 
I'm the lady from flashdance. 
that's a good flashdance,honey. 
Good flashdance. 
The holidays without drinking is rough. 
Turns out football is boring. 
My wife's sister ain't as cute as I thought she was. 
And I cannot play the guitar. 
Mr. Jordan,I know 
how difficult this is. 
I was pretty addicted to coke back in my wall street days. 
But you can get through this. 
The first night is the hardest. 
But tonight is ludachristmas. 
No,tonight you and i are gonna have some real christmas fun. 
We can play party games. 
Like murder! 
First,everybody takes a slip of paper out of a hat. 
And one person's slip says "murderer." 
And another person's slip says "inspector." 
Then everyone puts their head down. 
Except the murderer. 
He's the inspector. 
No,that's not right. 
K,thanks for trying to help. 
But I'm gonna go home,do some thinking, and tell my wife's sister to disregard all my emails. 
That hotel was a disaster,jack. 
The tv had over 100 channels,for god sakes. 
I'm only gonna be here for three days. 
Fine,mother. You 
can stay with me. 
No,I will not let you do that. Are you sure? 
Yes,mother,I'm quite sure. 
All right,then,that's settled. 
Jack,do you have a bathroom that I can get to in a hurry? 
Yes,right in here,mother. 
Well,that is close,isn't it? 
I'll be right out. 
She should've been there. 
Knock knock! 
It's just the lemons. 
We've come to drop off a little good-bye present. 
Oh,thank you! 
Oh,my goodness! 
What a beautiful office. 
Oh,your mother must be so proud of you. 
wow,look at this carpet. 
I feel like we should take off our shoes. 
Should we take off our shoes? 
No,please sit down and make yourselves comfortable. 
Well,we don't want to bother you. 
We know you must have big plans. 
Well,I was going to drive up to vermont and visit my girlfriend C.C. 
Oh,I love that name. 
 C.C. 
Ooh,I'll bet any girlfriend of yours is a real winner. 
Well,she is a congresswoman. 
Oh,my goodness! 
And she does have her own lifetime movie. 
Lifetime! 
 Wowsers! 
Why don't we cut the charade and you two tell me what exactly it is you want from me. 
now,alfonso,let's find where you should put the keyboard. 
Open,open hommina,hommina,hommina open pit barbecue sauce yes,this is the sweet spot. 
Oh,and no chitchat between songs this year. 
People don't watch letterman for paul shaffer. 
Excuse me,ma'am,do you know where the bathroom is? 
Hi there,mitch. 
It's jenna. Maroney. 
We know each other. 
Are you,like,a friend of my mom's or something? 
I mean,I'll tell her you said hi. 
What's up? Do 
you like wham? 
'Cause I'm kind of like the george michael of my school. 
Oh,you're mitch. 
 Yeah. 
Coming to the party tonight? 
Oh,I wish. 
I gotta rest up for my big ski trip tomorrow. 
You know,maybe you and i could do something together next week. 
Definitely. 
My parents are away next ******** ****** that's a filthy christmas miracle. 
There you guys are. I'm sorry 
they just barged in like that. 
On,not at all. 
They were just dropping off this christmas present. 
Oh,and look at this. 
It got cheese and butter and caramel. All my favorites. 
How did you know? 
Well,we will let you go. 
We've got a lot of window shopping to do. 
Jack,why don't you come with us? 
Come on,you can talk to mitch about president reagan. 
Oh,in his mind reagan is still president. 
You lucky bastard. 
What? 
I would love to go with you. 
Good,good,good! 
jack? 
Hey,dude,I thought you left. 
Yeah,I mean,what are you guys doing? Going to ludachristmas? 
Yep,we heard you can't drink. 
You still coming? 
No,no,I can't go because of the ankle bracelet. 
But maybe I could go and just not drink. 
Hey,maybe I'll compromise. 
I'll go to the party,cut off my foot,and drink all I want. 
Luda-christmas! 
Luda-christmas! 
Luda-christmas! 
Luda-christmas! 
Ludachristmas grizz,dotcom,shut the doors. 
Some people need to learn about christmas. 
Hey,watch out for her,jack. 
She's a natural athlete. 
Played high school football. 
It was just one game,dad. 
Although I did kind of change everything forever. 
I'll never forget that day. 
Jack,you laced those up like a professional. 
Good for you! 
It's nice to have some positive reinforcement,isn't it? 
Well,it's only positive reinforcement when they say it to you. 
In my case,they're just stating the facts. 
I do look like the arrow shirt man,I did lace up my skates professionally, and I did do a fabulous job finishing my muffin. 
You wish you were in my family. 
Don't be ridiculous. 
So this disney cruise in march,are you in or out? 
hey,huddle up. 
We're gonna take a picture. 
 Yeah. 
Oh,thank you. 
Say "lemon!" 
lemon! 
jack! 
Having fun? 
Under the bridge,under the bridge,woo! 
Jack,what the hell are you up to? 
Mother,I'm sorry,but the lemons invited me out,and I couldn't say no. 
They're very nice people. 
oh,nice. I'll 
show you nice. 
Let's all meet down at the soda shop while this country turns into mexico. 
Now,you see,they don't say things like that. 
They're very polite to each other. 
I suppose you think that they're more nurturing than I am. 
Mother,there are terrorist cells that are more nurturing than you are. 
Be careful. I'll cry. 
You give me ten minutes with the lemon family and I'll have them tearing at each other like drag queens at a wig sale. 
Mom,dad,this is jack's mom. 
We have heard such great things about you. 
Have you? 
You must join us for dinner. 
no,no,no! No,we can'T. 
We have plans. 
Uh,had plans. 
An evening out with the lemons. 
Who could ask for anything more? 
great! 
Thank you,reverend gary. 
That was both entertaining and educational. 
Christmas has gone off the rails around here. 
Look out there. 
That is not a christmas tree. 
It's a way to lure tourists into the basement to buy $20 salads. 
We've lost track of what's important. 
So now we're gonna go around the circle, and every one of us is gonna say what christmas means to them. 
Let's start here. 
It's so hard to choose. 
The photos of the food look so good. 
I am gonna have the fried onion tower for two for one. 
Good for you! 
You must be so proud of liz. 
Making it on her own so far away from home. 
That gives us an excuse to visit new york. 
I see. 
Any grandchildren? 
Oh,what a shame. 
Must eat you up inside. 
Oh,well,champy,our spaniel,keeps us pretty busy. 
See,mother,not all species eat their young. 
Let's change the subject. 
Politics. 
We don't discuss that stuff. 
Life is too short. 
 really? 
Life is too short? 
Because your life seems endless. 
thank you,reverend gary. 
It was to the tune of american pie,but so much longer. 
Listen,we done learned our lesson about the big tree or whatever. 
This has got to stop now! 
Yeah,who care abobout the true meaning of christmas? 
It's about getting crap and eating too much! 
Yeah! 
It's about getting drunk and hugging your cousin until your mom says,"frank,enough." 
That's right. 
Well,now seems like a good time for reverend gary to show the video of his mission to guatemala last year. 
What? 
Is this a culture where toplessness is common? 
Pieces of wood! 
Just like I prayed for! 
And here is what you did with your christmas presents. 
We take so much for granted. 
Instead of having a party,we should donate the money to those kids. 
We should tell all our family and friends we don't want any presents this year. 
yeah! 
We should volunteer at a soup kitchen instead of shopping for stuff no one needs! 
Yeah! 
We should go downstairs and chop down the big tree! 
yeah! 
No! No,wait! 
No,no,no,no,no,no,no! 
your mother is killing me. 
Have I ever kissed a woman? What is that about? 
Welcome to my world,lemon. 
She's trying to break your spirit. 
 Why? 
Because she's trying to prove that your family is as screwed up as mine is. 
Well,that's ridiculous. 
Oh,mitch found a newspaper. 
Mitch,that's a joke newspaper! 
What? 
Why can't you just leave well enough alone? 
Because the lemons are not what they appear to be. 
I mean,I may be heavy furniture,but I did a pretty good job raising you. 
I mean,look at you today and look at them. 
They look happy. 
They're in denial. 
I mean,come on! 
Now,dick,let me get-- - ah-ah,jack! 
It's on me. Wouldn't be a 
lemon party without old dick. 
Easy on the fried food,honey. 
Oh,come on,I can eat whatever I want. I'm a teenager. 
Mitch,don't you ever get tired of liz getting all the attention her being the baby and all? 
Oh,no,my folks make a lot of time for me. 
I mean,just yesterday we went to see goonies together You weren't supposed to know that,liz,sorry. 
Wait,you saw goonies yesterday? 
Does he mean 1985 yesterday? 
Yeah,december 6,1985. I mean,what 
else would I mean by yesterday? 
Well,that was the day of my football game. 
Did you not go to my football game? 
We were a little embarrassed,liz. 
Dad,did you it's white haven football,for god's sake,elizabeth. 
It means something. 
I wore that uniform. 
I was taking a stand for women. 
Are you taking a stand now by not giving us grandkids? 
Oh,you want grandchildren,margaret? Why 
don't you ever bother mitch about that? 
Because he's 17! 
He's 40! 
What? 
Oh,my god,the accident. I hit the tree. 
no,don't remember. 
Oh,I'm so old! 
Thank you,elizabeth lemon. 
You are so self-centered,young lady. 
You didn't even offer to pay for this dinner. 
I'm on a fixed income. 
Could I have another drink? 
Bingo. 
This is not what I meant! 
Yes,it is. 
We're sending a message to all of those who have forgotten the scruples of christmas. 
'Cause in order to stay sane,you have to go crazy! 
I had a couple of drinks before the meeting. 
Hold that,kenneth. This is a flask. 
So y'all probably shouldn't be listening to me. 
* have yourself a merry little christmas * * Make the yuletide gay * * from now on our troubles will be miles away * * here we are as in olden days...* 
do you know why i stay with you,dick? 
Yes,I do know. 
Because you have no income of your own,that's why. 
I could've been drinking these for years! 
Explain to me again how gay marriage is gonna tear this country apart! 
Merry christmas,mother. 
Merry christmas,jackie. 
tomorrow night I'm gonna take you to a cathouse. 
I hate cats. 
you'll learn to love them. 
it was ridiculous to lie to him that long anyway! 
my life is ruined!
