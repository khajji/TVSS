1 What? 
Lemon, I'm gonna be late for our meeting. 
I had to get out of my car and walk. 
Fifth Avenue is closed for a joint pain walkathon. 
It's only four blocks but they are so slow. 
I'm running late, too. 
My subway ride was the standard amazingness. 
No, that's not how it works. 
Let people off first, otherwise... 
The train's going express for no reason. 
Next stop, one millionth street and Central Park jogger memorial highway. 
Am I the last one in this city still following the rules of being a person? 
You know what, New York is overrated. 
 Three bucks, two bags, one me  Say, where does a young prostitute get started in this town? 
Overrated? 
Lemon, we live in the world capital of culture, finance and King Kong attacks. 
New York is a testament to man's greatness. 
No, New York is a testament to man's selfishness. 
I quote, "she is a thug in a cocktail dress." 
Alex Mccord, Real housewives of New York. 
Give me your wallet. 
Now, technically that was about Luann being a bitch at Sonia's Art show. 
But... hey, you never 
let me talk about h-wives this long. 
Let's just get this over with. 
Okay, well, I don't know if Sonja's ever gonna finish that toaster oven cookbook, but if she does, I am gonna buy it. 
30 ROCK S06 Ep.08 - The Tuxedo Begins 
Ugh, I can actually feel myself getting sick. 
Am I the only person who saw Obama's press conference on how to sneeze? 
Miss Lemon, the NBC gym sent this up for you. 
Oh, what is that smell?! 
It's my gym bag, Pete. 
Women do sweat. 
The gym said the odor was attracting bugs that were attracting bats that were attracting bat-hawks. 
Oh, also, the gym is closed. 
Well, don't worry, I will wash my workout clothes because I actually care how my behavior affects other people. 
Unlike the d-bag who let the elevator door close on me this morning. 
It was funny because you were so mad. 
Boy, when I move on to my new job I'm sure gonna miss you two and your whole Sam and Diane thing. 
Uh, Sam and Diane are the lesbian couple in my building who murdered each other. 
Is this my costume for the commercial parody? 
It's in my contract that I only play blondes, non-Irish redheads, or bald sex robots. 
Look, it's just for the old lady before picture. 
People won't even know it's you. 
Well then have Liz do it. 
She already has the frown lines. 
There, there they are. 
How funny, I was just talking about them and there they are. 
As always, I will step up and help because without people like me, civil society collapses completely. 
Oh, don't be so dramatic. 
That's my thing. 
And if you take it away from me, I will kill myself. 
And then you. 
Oh, I'm sorry we're starting so late. 
I know we're all very excited to adjust the TGS schedule to accommodate Tracy's next movie. 
I won an Oscar, so now I get to do real art. 
Beg snow dogs phase. 
There was a lot of traffic and, uh, I was attacked in a construction tunnel. 
Anyway, uh, this spreadsheet is the current schedule. 
Wait, you got mugged? 
Oh, I shouldn't hug you, I'm sick. 
This lamp is you. 
Ow, hot! 
That sucks, J.D. 
I got mugged all the time growing up in the Bronx. 
Okay, I got in trouble the last time I said this, but maybe you were asking for it dressed like that. 
I wasn't wearing a tuxedo at the time, Lemon. 
The mugger took my cufflinks. 
All I have here are tuxedo cufflinks and I'm not about to wear them with a suit... 
And look like an idiot. 
Give me the bad news. 
How black was this dude? 
On a scale from Lisa Bonet to dotcom. 
This is the thing that's bothering me. 
My assailant was a middle-aged white man wearing a button down shirt and dockers. 
Dockers! 
Not some drug addict or gang aficionado. 
His knife was from Eddie Bauer. 
Oh, my God. 
That means... 
Please interrupt me. 
This is a sign. 
The lower classes are getting cranky about the rich earning all of their money away from them. 
Can't they see this is in their best interest? 
How could we pay their salaries without using their money? 
We're on the verge of a class war. 
There's no class war. 
You getting mugged just proves what I said to you on the phone. 
New York is a selfish filth-monster, and eventually, it gets all of us. 
It's Ghostbusters 2 all over again. 
No, my getting mugged was New York doing what she does best... 
Calling a great man to action. 
It's the original Ghostbusters all over again. 
My attack was a wake up call. 
The rich need to defend themselves. 
I don't know, Jack. 
You can try to change New York, but it's like Jay-Z says. 
"Concrete bunghole where dreams are made up. 
There's nothing you can do." 
That's a wrap. 
That commercial parody is gonna be hilarious. 
What's a commercial? 
Oh, my God. 
You sound terrible. 
Oh... is that brain? 
Hopefully it's not an important parg of my blurn. 
Please, don't get me sick. 
Paul's finally coming home tonight. 
And his sexpectations will be high. 
Maybe I should wear this home. 
Show Chris what he'll be looking at in 40 years. 
Looser skin, same underwear. 
Hey, Pete, can I have a car home tonight? 
I'm old and very sick. 
And there's a Monk rerun on. 
I'm sorry, I'm losing my voice. 
 There's a Monk rerun on. 
 Nope, no dice. 
I can't order you a car unless it's after 9:00, or you have a note from your killer. 
Aw. 
So you got mugged, huh, Mr. Donaghy? 
And you caught the guy who did it. 
Good for you. 
Oh, no, Len, Tracey is helping me with this. 
But I can see how you went there. 
I have a criminal skull shape. 
Len, commissioner Kelly and I are friends. 
We have competing columns in Irish arguments weekly, America's only all-caps magazine, but Ray hasn't returned my phone call, and I know that you were once a police officer. 
I was part of a special task force of very young-looking cops who infiltrated high schools. 
How do you do, fellow kids? 
What? 
So I'm glad you called me, Mr. Donaghy. 
I checked with my contacts on the force and got you this free pamphlet. 
Len, I don't want a pamphlet. 
I want a show of force. 
A demonstration of who's in control of this city. 
I want a cop on every corner. 
Look, that's not gonna happen. 
It's just one mugging. 
Wait a second. 
Where did you get that suit? 
I'm not embarrassed. 
I get all my outfits at Ann Taylor loft. 
Their clothes fit my body and my budget. 
Exactly, budget. 
You have no interest in helping me. 
You're one of them. 
What do you make?  
Five figures? 
40 grand a year. 
But don't let the woman who's blackmailing me know that. 
And the police have no interest in helping me either despite the hundreds of dollars I pay every year in taxes. 
They think that I'm the enemy. 
We have no choice but to take matters into our own hands. 
 I agree! 
 You do? Oh, no! 
No, if I sneeze, I'll do it like the president taught me. 
I'm pregnant with a kitty cat. 
Those are my popsicles! 
Well, hello, sexy. 
Hello, Paul. 
I'm wearing an edible nightgown. 
It's breadstick flavor and it comes with a dipping sauce. 
Oh, you poor thing. 
You must be so tired. 
Oh, no, no, no, not at all. 
I have been thinking about this night for a long time. 
Uh-oh, yawns are contagious. 
Like all the Thai STDs my penis is about to give you. 
Ooh. 
Okay, well, give me five minutes and then I'll unpack... 
The sex monkey I bought in Jakarta. 
Ooh. 
What... what happened 
last night? 
We talked for a while and then we fell asleep. 
Without doing anything. 
W... how is that possible? 
We are Jenna and Paul. 
Did we mix up our days and accidentally both roofie each other? 
Or did we just fall asleep? 
What like some boring, normal, sit-com couple? 
Like, Mr. Brady 
and tiger the dog? 
Let's just think. 
We hate normal. 
Normal is death. 
But we didn't hate last night. 
So, it must not have been normal. 
Paul, I think we just found another level of sexuality. 
It's a whole new fetish called... 
Both: Normalling. 
So last night, I napped on you and you liked it, you sick bitch. 
Oh, yeah. 
And I put that Afghan all over you because I thought your feet might get chilly. 
So chilly. 
Oh, I just had the sickest idea. 
We go out as a couple to bed, bath and beyond and shop for home necessities. 
In front of everybody. 
Normalling in public? 
You delicious whore. 
Really, Trump? 
My idea is stupid? 
Well you make your hair every morning by sticking your head in a cotton candy machine. 
What are you guys doing? 
The police can't be counted on to protect the rich unless they're rich too. 
So we're gathering support for a private police department where the starting salary is... 
$5 million a year. 
How's that going? 
Slowly. 
Even Tommy Hilfiger turned me down and you'd think that he, of all people, would understand the lower classes can ruin something. 
Plaxico Burress just called our idea "poorly thought out". 
Then hung up by shooting his own phone. 
This is a travesty. 
The wealthy were once the heart of New York. 
I just don't understand this city anymore. 
That's funny, because I may have just figured it out. 
I used to be like you, thinking I could make the city follow my rules. 
I told off line cutters and movie theater talkers. 
And for what? 
Did anyone cheer me, or name a sandwich after me that would maybe be Turkey, pastrami, Swiss, Russian dressing, Cole slaw and potato chips? 
You can't count on anyone else in this city, Jack. 
All you can do is sink down into the filth. 
Or rise above it. 
If no one will help me, I'll do it myself. 
I'll remind New York of what she once was. 
Yes, a native American paradise! 
The greatest city on earth. 
A city that needs a leader who still believes in order and justice. 
Who'll shine a light into all the tunnels and police the police, who'll make this city into a beacon, lighting the way for an entire nation. 
Anyhoo, Tracy, in the dog boner sketch. 
I hereby officially announce my candidacy... 
For the office of Mayor of the city of New York. 
Vote for Jack Donaghy. 
Slogan to come. 
You know if we got cloth place mats then we could just throw them in the laundry. 
Well, these vinyl ones say dishwasher safe, that's easy. 
Yeah, easy for the person who never does the dishes. 
What we're doing is so sick, right? 
How many times have you climaxed? 
Zero. 
Me too. 
Bathroom organizers! 
Oh! 
Good news for your campaign, J.D. 
I got a huge list of voter names. 
Do you know anyone who wants to be called Daryl Weenus? 
I just registered the domain name for my campaign website... 
Jack-Donaghy-is-running for-mayor-2013 new-York-this-is the-website.Com. 
That's as close as I could get. 
Everything else was already pornography. 
I got everything on your list, Mr. Donaghy, 
fresh undershirts from Vattene, 18-year-old scotch for your bar, and, just for fun, I also got you these goofy water balloons my mom's friend Ron used to always send me out to buy. 
Thank you, Kenneth. 
I know they're condoms. 
All right, Tracy, let's buckle down. 
Now that I've restocked, we never have to leave this office. 
Hang on... have you not 
left this building since you were mugged? 
What? Uh, no, 
I've been very busy. 
What about your daughter? 
Liddy is at a baby leadership conference this week. 
The timing is perfect. 
I know what you're doing. 
The first time I got mugged, I didn't leave my room for a week. 
I hid, but not in a tuxedo. 
All I had was a Chewbacca costume made out of used hair extensions. 
It made me feel invincible. 
Like someone who wouldn't get scared and freeze up when they got mugged. 
Perfectly-executed Chewbacca sounds! 
That's why you won't take off that tuxedo, that's why you're running for mayor, and that's why you won't go outside. 
You're scared. 
The only thing I'm scared of is what's happening to this city. 
Then I'm gonna say to you what I say to all my sharks right before they die. 
Let's go outside. 
Oh, Jenna, I have a friend... 
Yeah, well I have a million friends. 
I get so many birthday cards it's embarrassing. 
No, I have a "friend" who wants to freak out some new yorkers, and I know you and Paul disgust everyone. 
Oh, he and I are on a whole new level. 
This morning, Paul and I signed up for zipcar. 
Now it's easier to get to Costco to stock up on cereal. 
Lee, I need the old lady wig again. 
Oh, and get me that coat that Tracy's dog gave birth on. 
A Costco run, huh? 
You sound like me and Paula. 
No, Pete you don't understand. 
This is normalling. 
It's a weird sex thing. 
Paul and I do things like reboot the Internet and discuss whether the chair would be better... 
Over by the window where there's more light? 
Yeah, that... that's not 
a sex thing. 
That's just couple stuff. 
Hey, you and Paul should come by the house sometime. 
We'll have dinner, play scattergories. 
No, that's not what this is. 
You get away from me! 
Scattergories. 
Where? Where? 
Miss Lemon, are you okay? 
Oh, you smell like when the stone Mountain tire fire joined up with the corpse fire, and then swept through the downtown Manure district. 
It was our fault for letting those high schoolers dance at their prom. 
Oh, I'm better than okay, Kenneth. 
I'm going to the movies. 
But you're sick. 
I am sick. 
Sick like a fox. 
I'm gonna clear out that whole theater and watch a sneak peak of The hunger games by myself. 
It'll be my greatest triumph. 
There's a Q & A afterwards with... 
Eh, the screenwriter? 
Bleh. 
Miss Lemon, this isn't you. 
You love rules. 
Try to remember. 
Remember who you once were. 
What did the rules ever get me? 
The worst seat at the movies? 
A bunch of music that I paid for? 
A drawer full of leaky batteries that I don't know what to do with? 
Rules? 
There's only one rule now, Kenneth. 
Plastic cups go on the top rack of the dishwasher so they don't melt. 
Otherwise, no rules. 
Well, well, well. 
If isn't the tuxedo himself. 
Shouldn't you be outside, fixing the city? 
Well you look even closer to death than usual. 
 What happened to you? 
 Are you scared? 
The back of the "B" train certainly was. 
I had the whole car to myself. 
So this is you figuring out New York? 
Making the city worse for your own selfish ends? 
Is that your gym bag? 
Aren't you a human woman? 
It's these new microfibers. 
They keep you dry but it all has to go somewhere. 
So, today a subway car, tomorrow, what? 
All in good time, Jack. 
Will you take something for that cough already? 
I'd rather see if it gets better on it's own. 
Do you want me to go on my antibiotic rant? 
It's endless. 
You'll beg for death. 
There's a war going on out there. 
And you're gonna have to pick a side. 
I've always wanted to say that, and I can't believe I've wasted it on you. 
You've crossed a line, Lemon. 
Someone's gonna stop you. 
New York is gonna stop you. 
The old Liz would have agreed with you. 
But that was two days ago. 
Now, I don't cross lines, I just make 'em... 
disappear. 
Hey, hon, I got your g-chat. 
Two exclamation points, huh? 
What's up? 
Paul, what if normalling isn't a fetish? 
What if we're just in another phase of our relationship and we're kind of... 
Settling down? 
That's what one of my work colleagues said. 
That's just couple stuff. 
You know what, you and Jenna should come visit me and my wife in Montclair. 
But if Daryl Weenus is right, if we're just a couple, why don't we hate it? 
I don't know. 
I always imagined this kind of thing would make me wanna tear my hair out and rip my skin off. 
But with you, it feels as natural as... 
Having someone tear your hair out and rip your skin off. 
I never thought this would happen to me, but I can actually imagine myself getting married, having kids. 
But is this really what we want? 
I don't know. 
 What are you thinking? 
 What are you thinking? 
Okay, we'll both say what we're thinking on the count of three. 
One... two... 
Both: Sexual walkabout. 
We spend the next three months alone, doing every depraved thing we can think of with as many people as we can and if this, right now, is still the happiest we can make ourselves, we'll stay together forever. 
Next stop, dinner and a private show. 
Gym bag, check. 
Tupperware vat of steamed broccoli, check. 
Talking to myself to seem crazy... moo-goo! 
Wallet. 
No, not wow. 
Not when I'm so close. 
Not enough time! 
My plan. 
Come on, Donaghy. 
You've skied Mount St. Helen's, 
made eye contact with Michelle Bachmann, been trapped under a Boulder for 128 hours. 
You're not scared of anything. 
Gimme $20! 
Lemon! 
Oh, my tail bone. 
I just wanted to borrow movie money. 
You caught that lunatic that's been terrorizing the subway. 
The worst criminal in ♪ N-Y-C Oh, my God, are you okay? 
That was awesome. 
 You were so fast and strong. 
 Thank you, Lemon. 
You're the only woman I could ever fight to regain my manhood. 
They're cheering you for stopping me. 
Old Liz was right. 
People do want rules! 
There's good in all of us, Lemon. 
Even you. 
So, are you still running for mayor? 
The city no longer needs me. 
For now. 
Reminds me of us. 
I'll never forget the first time you dressed up like and old lady and I threw you into some garbage. 
Good-bye, my love. 
For now. 
New York City. 
Villains and heroes. 
The 1% and the 99. 
8 million people in this crazy, beautiful city, and I, Jenna Maroney, am going to go to town on every last one of them. 
﻿1 Jack, I've got a huge problem. 
The TGS sweatshirts were supposed to say "TGS Season Six, Yuck," which is a catch-phrase from a pretty great sketch. 
Yuck! 
But they got misprinted and now they say, "TGS Season Six, Duck!" 
And that's a season five catchphrase. 
Duck!? 
Lemon, that is not a real problem. 
A real problem is losing your giant scissors right before a ribbon-cutting for a couch factory. 
I just...had them. 
Oh, thank God. 
I thought I'd lost them. 
Today... 
I want everything to be perfect. 
I'm opening a factory. 
And factories provide three things this country desperately needs: Jobs, pride, and material for Bruce Springsteen songs. 
Great, so we solved your problem, but now I've gotta wear last year's sweatshirt to my cousin's wedding. 
Oh, I'm so tired. 
I was out all last night with my new rock star boyfriend. 
Oh, I listened to rock and roll music once, but I stopped before I started worshipping the devil. 
The song went, "Mr. Sandma--", 
then I shut it off. 
Morning, Jenna. 
Oh, thanks. 
Dating a musician is amazing. 
This sexual walkabout I'm on is really opening me up  to new experiences. 
 What's new? 
You've been with tons of musicians. 
Back in Chicago, I walked in on you with the guy from blues traveler. 
He still had his harmonica thing on. 
Sure, I've dated musicians before. 
But I've never sexually manipulated one into leaving his band for me. 
Like Yoko Ono and the Beatles, or Lance Drake Mandrell and Wilson Phillips. 
My boyfriend's last album went quadruple-platinum. 
They sold out Madison square garden in nine minutes, for a Tuesday morning show. 
Wait, who plays on a Tuesday morning? 
I don't know, just a little band called the Woggels. 
 apples are red   bananas are yellow   I love my friends, bananas are yellow   My Russ is the blue one. 
  He's about to do something amazing. 
Oh, I know the Woggels. 
My eight-year-old niece walked down the aisle to that song at her wedding. 
Wait, you're trying to break up a children's group? 
Well, it ticks off a lot of boxes on my sexual walkabout list. 
"Yoko a band, "make love to a beloved children's entertainer, be with a non-aboriginal Australian--" I thought the whole point of this was to see if someone could make you happier than Paul. 
I mean, if you're just checking off boxes, maybe you should get back together before it's too late. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
He's not replacing me. 
We're having an adventure. 
And I hope right now he is also with a beloved children's entertainer. 
Maybe Raffi. 
Or the sedated prisoner they put inside of Barney. 
Something terrible has happened! 
And for once I'm not talking about the collapse of the middle class. 
It's my family. 
My oldest son, George Foreman, got into Stanford, and he's planning to attend. 
Tracy, that's awesome. 
Stanford's a great school. 
I didn't even get in, and I was first in my class. 
Although, only seven of us graduated that year because of a bad mono outbreak which somehow missed me, despite all the frenching I did. 
You don't understand. 
Jordan men don't go to college. 
We go to the school of hard knocks, a one-year vocational program where you learn to bang on doors and scare people into subscribing to magazines  that they'll never get. 
 Mr. Jordan, 
 you should be proud. 
 Proud? 
My son's a nerd! 
Tracy, in the real world, you need a college degree to succeed. 
Really, Dotcom? 
How did your city council campaign go? 
Well, as far as raising the level of discourse in this city? 
I'd say it was a great success. 
This is Angie's fault! 
She coddled him. 
I'm gonna teach my son what it is to be a Jordan. 
And I'm gonna die trying! 
Yes? 
Mr. Donaghy. 
This is Dr. Pravin Singh. 
I performed your mother's heart surgery last month. 
No, you must have the wrong Mr. Donaghy. 
My mother didn't have heart surgery. 
Colleen Donaghy. 
Born April 24, 1925, at Boston catholic guilt hospital. 
She keeps calling me Aladdin. 
That's definitely her. 
Well, she's recovering very nicely, but we don't have anyone to release her to. 
We found your name on a list of disappointments she keeps folded up in her shoe. 
Well, doctor, I can't come to the hospital to bring my mother home. 
I'm in New York, not Florida. 
Mr. Donaghy, I'm calling 
you from Cornell medical center. 
My mother's in New York? 
Dr. Singh, 
are you stealing my hats? 
What do you do, feed them to your cow God? 
Mother, what are you doing? 
Who told you to call my son? 
Oh, please, you wanted him to call. 
Somehow, you knew I was opening a sofa factory today. 
 Could we just... 
 Ooh, sofa. 
Somebody got all flouncy when I wasn't looking. 
What are you gonna do, put on your galoshes and go eat some fruit, like a Frenchman? 
Fruit is part of a balanced diet, you miserable harridan. 
Good God! You've ruined every 
significant moment in my life. 
And now,  you've ruined this. 
 Jack, for God's sake, there's only one reason I came to New York, and that's because Gunga Din here takes my insurance. 
So you were planning on never telling me you were having heart surgery? 
Look, I do have other patients. 
Yes, I'm sure you do. 
Oh. 
Yes, I know it's over, Kouchie. 
Unlike you, I have eyes. 
 Silly dinosaurs   this is just a list of things now let's list some more   a pogo stick   a hot air balloon   a hat that's full of soup   another pogo stick  Yeah! All right! 
Okay, all right. 
Where do you think you're going? 
I'm with Russ, Ian. 
What? 
You afraid my sexuality might tear this band apart? 
Listen here, Jenna. 
We're the Woggels. 
Nothing can tear us apart... 
Except for the shark that got a hold of the fifth woggel. 
 Basketballs hula hoops rollercoaster loop-the-loops   you just heard the Woggels sing   a very silly list of things  Woggel power! 
So to help your mother's weakened heart continue to beat, we implanted an "LVAD" device. 
Yes, I'm familiar with that. 
My good friend dick Cheney got one. 
A month later, he and I went hunting in Mexico. 
He shot thousands of doves that day and only hit me in the leg once. 
So, you know that it runs on rechargeable batteries? 
Like the flashlight in my race war preparedness bag. 
Mrs. Donaghy, 
the fact that you didn't call your son is worrisome. 
What good would he have been? 
He's useless in a hospital. 
I recall this one time he cried and cried. 
I mean, it was more like wailing. 
It was awful. 
She's referring to my birth. 
Look, I know this is a lot to process, so I'll leave you two alone to talk. 
About what? 
Can you believe this is the best room they have? 
This is supposed to be a hospital, not a Japanese internment camp I volunteered at during the war. 
Well, if you're not happy here I could put you up at the Plaza. 
You could look out at the park and watch carriage horses being whipped. 
I know how you love that. 
I can't go to the Plaza, and you know it. 
What if I run into Eloise? 
Am I supposed not to mention the fact that she has a gay grandson? 
Everybody knows! 
Well, then, of course I'd love to have you stay  with me and Liddy. 
 Liddy? 
Why couldn't you name the baby after my mother? 
Because at Ellis island, your mother's name was recorded as "unclaimed Irish stowaway." 
Son, we have a lot of work to do today if I'm gonna "reverse Urkel" you. 
Dad, I just want to read. 
Jordan men don't read. 
Grizz, tear this book in half. 
Son, I'm gonna show you how a real Jordan man enjoys himself. 
It's montage time. 
Tray, montage got married and quit stripping. 
Fine, we'll just do a series of activities. 
Gonna Build a Mountain]   Gonna build a daydream    Uhhuh    from a little hope    Uhhuh    gonna push that daydream    Uhhuh    up a mountain slope    Uhhuh    gonna build a daydream    Yeah yeah    gonna see it through    Yeah yeah   gonna build a mountain and a daydream   gonna make 'em both come true    yeah yeah    Gonna build a heaven   from a little hell   Little hell   gonna build a heaven    and I know darn well    Darn well    if I build my mountain    Yeah yeah    with a lot of care    Yeah yeah   and take my daydream up the mountain   heaven will be waiting there   gonna build a mountain gonna build it high   I don't know how I'm gonna do it   I only know I'm gonna try  Well, Colleen ruined the ribbon-cutting. 
She's in New York. 
She's been here for weeks, recovering from heart surgery. 
Oh, my God, is she okay? 
She's fine. 
They gave her the same heart pump dick Cheney had. 
Next thing you know, they'll be giving her his retractable wings and rocket arms. 
She's going to bury us all. 
Jack, your mom's 87. 
Do you think maybe she had the surgery in New York to be close to you, so you guys could, you know, have the talk? 
"The talk"? 
Lemon, my mother did explain sex to me, three years ago. 
There were...drawings. 
No, I mean,the talk. 
Your mom's heart doesn't work. 
You need to sit down and say how you feel so you don't have any regrets. 
I've done it, Jack, and it isn't easy, but it's very rewarding. 
You talk in your sleep. 
I know what you did in the war, and before you die, I want you to know that I know. 
I know you Donaghys think you're so tough, but Colleen is here because she's trying to reach out to you. 
Just get in the same room with her, and the talk will happen. 
I guar-on-tee. 
I don't know why I said that. 
This is such a serious conversation. 
I'm sorry. 
Uh, Lemon, I assure you, my mother is not in New York to spend time with me. 
She already wants to leave my apartment because Liddy is "giving her the stink eye." 
As soon as she feels up to it, she is going back to Florida. 
There was no need for us to start jabbering about our feelings and sobbing like Bill Belichick listening to Adele. 
Okay, fine. 
 But you and your mom  Nope. 
As my coffee cup said this morning, "you only regret the things you didn't do. 
This cup was made from recycled toilet paper." 
Don't let Colleen leave without saying what you need to say. 
 Last word. 
 Damn it! 
 I'm a kangaroo, I'm a kangaroo    loot da doo da doo   What is that? 
Oh, it's nothing. 
It's just a song I've been fiddling with. 
Or, as we say in Australia, a song I've been fiddling wazzle. 
It's good. 
It's really good. 
And this is coming from someone Quincy Jones once pushed off a boat. 
So, why does Ian write all the songs? 
He's just keeping you down, because he knows you're the real genius of the Woggels. 
Really? 
Do you think so, Jenna? 
It doesn't matter what this brain thinks. 
It matters what this brain thinks. 
 Lemon, there you are. 
 Good morning, Jack. 
Did you talk to Colleen? 
If you're ordering me an edible arrangement to say thanks, I'd prefer a meat one. 
Yes, Colleen and I did talk. 
Specifically, she said a car was circling the block, "casing the house." 
I tried to explain that those were all different taxi cabs, and she said, "then why is the same man driving all of them," and insisted on leaving. 
She won't go to a hotel, and she hates the Princeton club, because Dean Cain is always there hoping to get recognized. 
I tried to leave her at the Bodies" exhibit God, that is all just a smoke screen. 
She's acting out because she wants to have the conversation, and you won't meet her halfway. 
I decided something last night after I got your tenth text message, one of which was an inscrutable emoticon. 
Hold it sideways, it's me going like this: "Talk to your mother!" 
The "8" is my glasses. 
Yes, someday, my mother is going to die, and we're going to deal with it our way. 
Well, your way is wrong, and I bet Colleen agrees with me. 
I'm glad you said that, Lemon. 
Good luck. 
Ah, Elizabeth. 
Can we do something about the temperature in here? 
I'd like it humid and cold. 
Duck! 
Yoko announcement. 
Russ wrote a song. 
A great song. 
And if you don't sing it at the Gwammys, which is the Grammys for toddlers, Russ is going solo. 
Russ, I write the songs here, so you have to choose. 
Her, or us? 
Come on, mate, Woggel power. 
In Australia, "woggel" means "white." 
Hm. 
Let's get out of here. 
I want to lick that turtleneck off of you. 
Yeah. Come on, Jenna. 
Fine, leave. 
We'll just replace you. 
Anyone can be replaced. 
Especially girlfriends. 
No, you don't know what you're talking about. 
Paul isn't gonna I mean, Russ. 
Paul is American for Russ. 
Oh. 
Ugh, Dean Cain. 
You know what? 
I'm glad Jack put you in here. 
Because I think we need to talk, about talking. 
What's the matter with you? 
Are you on drugs or something? 
Don't you think, at a certain point in life, parents and children should sit down and express their feelings before it's too late? 
God on a wheel! 
Jackie and I know how we feel. 
We don't have to say it out loud like a couple of gays getting married in jean shorts in Provincetown while I'm just trying to enjoy an ice cream on the pier! 
Okay, fine. 
If I can't convince you, maybe you'll listen to the words of Mike and the mechanics, whose song The Living Years I definitely remember. 
"Say it out, speak it clear. 
"You should listen, dude. 
Also, hear. 
It's too late, when--"    You have two minutes to find that battery before I die. 
You guys do not like talking! 
Great news, everyone! 
George Foreman is not going to Stanford. 
He's decided to permanently join the entourage. 
I'll start the paperwork. 
Wait, he's not going to college? 
Look, yesterday was the first time I've ever spent the day with my dad like that, and... 
I just want to keep doing it. 
You need to take him to security. 
It takes a week to get an I.D. 
Tony will rush it for me. 
We do zumba together. 
 My son is 17. 
Have I really never spent a day with him doing father and son stuff? 
Like teaching him how to ride a bike... 
Down the Luxor pyramid. 
Or drive a car... 
Vel franchise into the ground. 
I never even taught him how to shave... 
An orangutan. 
Well, sir... 
That doesn't mean you're a bad father. 
Yes, it does. 
I haven't been there for him since day one. 
Hey, Angie. 
What's up? 
   You had the baby? 
Okay. 
Name him George Foreman. 
And also, we're out of soda at home. 
Lamont, hurry up and deliver that baby before they realize we're not doctors. 
But I'm finally connecting with my son, and he wants to be here. 
I don't know what to do. 
I wish I had a father to talk to. 
But Liz Lemon is the only person I know who even has a father. 
Well, Mr. Jordan, 
speaking from experience, All My Children... 
was cancelled. 
As you can see, I'm out of my wheelhouse here. 
But, if you want to talk about wheelhouses Liz Lemon it is. 
 I'm a little Joey a baby kangaroo   jumped out of mommy's pouch   and now I don't know what to do   I wanted to go walkabout, around the world I roamed   but now the fun is over, and I want to get back home   mommy kangaroo mommy kangaroo   separate the races, mommy kangaroo  Oh, God. 
It's all been a terrible mistake. 
You don't just jump out of the pouch and walk away from something so good, something that makes you happy. 
Wait. 
Are you saying I should go back to the Woggels? 
The what? 
No. 
That song, like everything, is about me. 
I'm the baby kangaroo who went on the walkabout. 
What have I done? 
My driver will take you to the airport. 
I'm glad you're feeling well enough to travel. 
Jack, can we make sure the pilot is a man. 
I don't know, ever since Amelia Earhart, I'm a little skittish about lady pilots. 
Yes, mother, captain Chuck cutler. 
I'm told he has a mustache. 
 Mm, good. 
 Goodbye, mother. 
I know it won't be welcome, but I will point out that this is your final "talk-portunity." 
 Not another word, Lemon. 
 Sew up your cabbage hole, girl. 
Lime to a Lemon, you need to tell me what to do about George Foreman. 
Liz, has this whole walkabout thing been a mistake? 
 Jenna made me forget about... 
 What if I'm already too late? 
 Why I came here, so I guess... 
 What if Paul's actually... 
 I'll just go to the beach. 
 Replaced me? 
Both of you need to stop right there. 
If you are having a problem with a loved one, there is only one thing you need to do. 
Communicate! 
Go to Paul, go to George Foreman. 
And as difficult as it might be, talk to them. 
Before you lose them forever, tell them how you feel. 
Have the talk. 
George Foreman first, dinner break, then Paul. 
I'm sorry, was that supposed to be for our benefit? 
Do you think we're idiots? 
If you were my kid, I'd mail you back to the stork. 
She's not kidding. 
When I was eight, she took me to the post office because I spilled juice on a couch reserved for the pope, which has still never been used. 
He'll come. 
But I am sorry I tried to mail you. 
I forgive you. 
And I'm sorry about the juice, which you should know was actually wine. 
I forgive you, too. 
You know, you've always been my favorite child. 
Thank you. 
You never gave me any trouble. 
You always ate your vegetables, you went to church, and you loved breast feeding. 
I just wanted to make you proud of me. 
That's all I ever wanted. 
If I've ever had any success in this life, it's because of you. 
Oh. 
I made this happen! 
Not a part of this, I get it. 
But I made this happen! 
I made this happen. 
Son, this isn't easy for me to say, because my tongue caught what my foot has. 
But I need to say it. 
You should do what's best for you. 
Look, I want to go to college, but... 
I love you, dad. 
And I'm gonna love you no matter what. 
Even if you become a doctor, or a lawyer, or a philanthropist who devotes his life to others. 
I'll still be proud of you. 
Good-bye, my son. 
But dad, college doesn't start for another five months. 
I said, good-bye, my son. 
Great. 
Now let's go do my thing. 
Okay. 
  Oh, God. 
He's dressed like her. 
I'm too late. 
I've been replaced. 
Kouchie? 
Look on the bright side. 
My thing went perfectly. 
I have something for you. 
It's not much, but I thought maybe you could put it in Liddy's room. 
Oh. 
Oh. 
This was your mother's. 
Well, I know, but I wanted to make sure you got it. 
Hang on. 
If your plan was to have surgery, then go back to Florida without ever seeing me, why did you bring this with you? 
What is this, the Spanish inquisition? 
Oh, you'd know. 
You lived through it. 
Oh.  
Get...off. Ow! 
 Get...off. 
 I did this! 
Liz, there's something wrong with Pete. 
Oh, my God, is he dead? 
I... I don't know what happened. 
Kenneth, I need a light bulb replaced in my dressing room. 
Easy as pie, Ms. Maroney. 
What could go wrong? 
Why would I even say that? 
Hey, whatever happened to TiVo? 
Remember, you used to fast-forward, it'd make that sound? 
Boop-boop, boop-boop. 
Yeah. Yeah, then it'd 
be all like, bung-bung. 
 Boopboop, boopboop. 
 Bungbung, bungbung. 
 Bungbung, bungbung. 
 Boopboop, boopboop. 
Boop-boop, boop-boop. 
What's this? 
It's Terry, the gender-neutral doll I had when I was a kid. 
And he/she has his/her baseball glove and baby. 
And both sets of genitals! 
That was hard to track down. 
Today, almost all of them are in police evidence lockers. 
So, happy three-month anniversary, and happy two-week anniversary of you going to the bathroom when I'm here. 
You shouldn't be buying me gifts. 
You should be saving for your business. 
Oh, I think remembering our anniversary is going to get me some business. 
Aww, yeah! 
There's a whole other hand where that came from, big boy. 
Not my best. 
Hey, listen, why don't you go in late today, okay? 
I'll make pancakes with M&Ms in them. 
Fine, I'll stay! 
Gyah. 
All right. 
Do you want a smiley face? 
German flag, please. 
Jordan's comments have angered gay-rights groups and are likely annoying his co-workers who thought they'd linger over breakfast this morning, perhaps with a new lover. 
Wow, that is some detailed reporting, curry. 
When I say "NBC," you say... 
Over it! 
 NBC! 
 Over it! 
 NBC! 
 Over it! 
Word. 
Ugh, look at that old bag from TGS. 
Okay, I am a human being, sir. 
Oh, you mean my tote bag. 
Yes, I need a new one. 
Look, I'm sorry about Tracy. 
He really is a good person. 
Do you think I'm pulling this hat off? 
No. 
 From the top! 
 Over it! 
Oh, my God, there you are. 
We're losing sponsors, Liz. 
Did you know that snuggles the fabric softener bear is gay? 
He's dating the charmin cub. 
I thought they were babies. 
Unbelievable. 
Tracy, do you know how many of your hard-working and dedicated co-workers are gay? 
Him. Him. 
Her when she's drunk. 
I genuinely don't know. 
That one's a puzzler. 
And why did you have to offend the gay community? 
It is the most organized of all the communities. 
They make the Japanese look like the greeks. 
How is what I said offensive, and that's not? 
Because no one heard me say it. 
Look, I need to know what we're apologizing for, Tray. 
What did you say? 
Being gay is stupid. 
If you want to see a penis, take off your pants. 
If I got turned into a gay, I'd sit around all day and look at my own junk. 
Oh, my God. 
First of all, if you "got turned into a gay"? 
Do you think the people of Raleigh, North Carolina turned Clay Aiken gay? 
Why not? 
The Bronx turned me dyslexic. 
Look, you're a public figure, and believe it or not, the dumb things you say may influence or hurt people. 
You need to apologize. 
I already called Glad, Liz Lemon. 
Thank you for calling Glad, stronger trash bags with less plastic. 
This is Diane. 
How may I help you? 
Hey Diane, it's Tracy Jordan. 
Sorry about what I said. 
 Well, okeydokey. 
That's the wrong "glad," Tracy. 
Whatever. I'm tired of 
apologizing all the time for just being myself. 
Remember when I offended stubborn people? 
That took forever to sort out. 
Well, Tracy, I know you don't want me writing an apology for you. 
That's terrific, thank you. 
Aww. 
Lemon. 
I'm on top of the Tracy thing. 
I just spoke to him... 
Actually, I want to talk to you about something else. 
Because of my unfortunate situation with Avery, I'm alone. 
And I know, of course, that you're not seeing anyone, therefore I've decided that you and I should become friends with benefits. 
No, thank you, please. 
Aha! The only reason 
you would reject that offer is if you had a secret boyfriend. 
Right, that's the only reason. 
I saw you, Lemon. 
At the movies, last night, with your mouth on a man. 
Why would you keep this from me after all of our time together? 
This is hurtful, Elizabeth. 
What's his name? 
I don't want to tell you. 
Why? 
Is it a stupid name, like "Dakota" or "Barack"? 
His name is "Chris," and I'm sorry, but for my own reasons... 
And "Chris" is spelled? 
No "h" and two "s"s. 
That! Right there, that's 
why I didn't want to tell you, because I knew you wouldn't approve of him. 
Why? What does 
he do for a living? 
Criss is trying to... 
You can stop right there. 
He's an entrepreneur. 
He's currently meeting with investors in the hopes of starting an organic gourmet hot dog truck. 
Lemon, I have said "good God" to you before, but I don't think I've ever meant it until now. 
Good God! 
Where does this person live? 
 Don't worry about it. 
 How bad can it be? 
Jersey city? 
His parents' apartment? 
It's not a walk-up, is it? 
He's actually been living with me for the past month. 
Ah. 
No, I am not engaging, I am not inviting input, Jack, because Criss is different. 
How is he different? 
Well, that's just a stupid question. 
I mean, I'm more relaxed around him. 
My jaw stopped popping. 
Listen. 
And for once I'm not overthinking everything, which is why I don't want you in my head. 
Ah, but I'm already in your head, Lemon. 
The fact that you felt you had to keep "Chris," and I'm saying his name with an "h" and only one "s", the fact that you kept him from me simply proves that it doesn't matter whether I meet him or not. 
You already know what I would say, and you know I'm right. 
I'm ignoring you. 
You're not here. 
 Who's not here, Liz? 
 I don't know, Liz. 
 I love you. 
 Oh, I love you too. 
So I might as well meet him and get it over with. 
I'll probably love him. 
After all, we're both Princeton men. 
Princeton? 
No, Criss went to... no! 
I am on to you. I am not 
going to talk about him. 
You can't keep me out. 
Oh, Ms. Maroney. 
I'm afraid I have bad news. 
 Jenny McCarthy died? 
But who could have been slowly poisoning her? 
Was she poisoned? 
I have no way of knowing, because I'm just hearing about it. 
No, ma'am, I spoke to maintenance about replacing the light bulbs in your room, but Mr. Subhas is refusing 
to do any work for TGS until Mr. Jordan issues 
an apology for his remarks. 
He also said that he thinks, quote, "sexuality is a continuum," and he is but a voyager on a vast ocean of pleasure. 
 This is unacceptable, Kenneth. 
Do you understand how important proper lighting is to an actress? 
Especially now that I'm officially a "B-list" celebrity, thanks to America's kids got singing. 
Oh, congratulations, Ms. Maroney. 
I just found out this morning, Teri Polo and Ving Rhames called me at home. 
So what if a tour came by and some Fanny pack fatty took a picture of me in my poorly-lit dressing room? 
And then they put the picture on the Internet? 
That can't happen. 
I need my special, pink-gel fluorescents, and I need them now. 
But only maintenance is allowed in the supply room. 
Kenneth, do this for me, someone I hope you consider a friend, and who in return thinks of you as sort of an albino slave-monkey. 
Aw, you think of me? 
Mm-hmm. 
But I don't have a key. 
You think we need a key? 
I guess someone's never been locked in a dog crate and thrown overboard for displeasing the sheikh. 
A statement from TGS head writer Elizabeth Lemon, adding... 
I gotta get a real headshot. 
In other news, after lots of high financial... 
And now, I am headed home for a "nooner," which is what I call having pancakes for lunch. 
Liz Lemon, did you just call me an idiot on this TV? 
Yeah, but... 
And what exactly is that supposed to mean? 
It means you're someone who should know better, but you constantly do stupid things. 
How dare you! I am nonplussed, 
and that is the correct usage. 
You have offended and humiliated me. 
Well, maybe now you know how gay people felt when you suggested that they sit around all day and look at their own junk. 
Wait. 
Why don't they do that? 
Okay, you're right, L.L. 
I do get how they felt. 
Insulted, marginalized, and outraged. 
Which is why I'm going to do exactly what they did and organize a protest of this network. 
A protest? By whom? 
By idiots! 
What an idiot. 
All right, I'm out. 
I've been dealing with Tracy all morning, and clearly this is only going to get worse. 
Time to go into Hornberger crisis mode. 
Is that when you cry on the floor in your office? 
Nope, I do that when I see myself in the mirror on my birthday. 
Crisis mode is when I down a couple of sleeping pills with scotch, pass out in my secret napping place, and hope I dream about that latina security guard. 
The one you always kiss on the mouth. 
That's normal in Guatemala. 
Oh. 
Picking a lock is like riding a bike. 
They're both skills you need to escape the Atlanta Falcons' equipment room. 
Hurry, Ms. Maroney. 
If Mr. Subhas 
finds us in here, I don't even know what he'll say, because I can't understand him. 
There! 
My pink fluorescents. 
They're the same lights poultry farms use to keep the birds from pecking each other to death. 
Are you as turned on as I am right now? 
Oh, we have to clean this up. 
"Fluorescent lights contain Mercury." 
That's poisonous. 
I'm well aware of that, Kenneth. 
I faked Mercury poisoning to get out of my contract   The musical. 
"If broken, remove all people and pets from the room"? 
Why? Are there fumes? 
Are we breathing Mercury fumes right now? 
Kenneth. I'm going to tell you 
what I told Phil Spector. 
"It's gonna be okay, baby. 
"We just have to get some trash bags "and get back here before anyone's the wiser. 
Then we can keep recording my album." 
Oh, come on, Subhas. 
Got to keep daddy's special sleepy-place clean. 
Hey, so check this out. 
I think I saw Billy Dee Williams in riverside park this morning when I was meeting dogs. 
Now that seems like a good use of time for a busy entrepreneur. 
Hello, Lemon. 
Chew with your mouth closed. 
So, question about Lando Calrissian... 
Is that an Armenian name? 
Is he a space Armenian? 
I don't know. 
The Kardashians are Armenian, they're into black guys, so there's something to it... 
I like how his voice goes up at the ends of sentences. 
That's very masculine. 
Oh, my. Is that a tan line 
on Criss' thumb? 
Did Criss used to wear a thumb ring? 
Oh, better hold on to this one. 
He's getting a free muffin soon. 
Wow, I've never seen a sunglass hut credit card before. 
Oh, a ukulele with an Obama sticker on it. 
Hmm. 
 this guy might suck That was a gift from Criss' kickball team. 
Well, I think I've seen enough. 
Which totally supports your theory that the phillie phanatic is biologically a female. 
Oh, yeah, if you watch those games, that thing definitely has a menstrual cycle. 
 Right? 
 You gonna put on pants today? 
Eh. 
I'm in your head. 
We're here, we're proud, I came up with this rhyme! 
You brought this on yourself, Liz Lemon. 
The so-called idiot community will not be silenced. 
For God's sake, Tracy. 
We are legion. 
We are America. 
Frat guys, DJs, loud-mouthed old bitches, investment bankers, the tramp-stamped, parrot-heads, anti-vaccination crusaders, and people who won't shut up about scuba diving. 
It's a whole other world down there. 
And our celebrity spokesperson, actress Denise Richards. 
That's right. 
I'm an idiot. Surprised? 
Well, I am. 
For all "intensive purposes." 
Our community is mobilized now, L.L. 
And we're not leaving until we're heard. 
You can't ignore us, Liz Lemon. 
We will be out here every day, misremembering movie quotes. 
Because as Braveheart said, "you can take our freedom, unless you take our lives." 
Say you approve of Criss, Jack. 
Am I in your head, Lemon? 
Yes, but don't be so proud. 
I also have a lot of imaginary arguments with the couples on house hunters. 
Why can't people look past paint color? 
Lemon, obviously I can't approve of someone I've never met. 
Yeah, well, I'm not letting you meet Criss, because you won't approve of him. 
Well, then I guess this is a catch-22. 
Although I don't know for sure, because I refuse to read literature that questions the morality of war. 
Look, clearly I hurt your feelings. 
You're upset that I didn't tell you about Criss. 
No, no, no, I'm quite over your subterfuge, although I do expect a note of apology. 
And don't try to make it funny. 
Just apologize. 
But I feel like people expect comedy... 
They don't. 
It's exhausting. 
However, you're right that I am having an emotional reaction. 
It's very frustrating to watch someone I care about do something she clearly knows is bad for her, like that week you wore those blue contact lenses. 
I looked like Adriana Lima. 
And you don't know that Criss is bad for me, and you never will. 
So you better get on board the Criss train. 
Criss-a, Criss, Criss, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss train! 
Do you have any water? 
You know what, Lemon? 
Fine. You are 
technically an adult. 
You can do whatever you want. 
Really? So I won? 
With the train thing? 
I won't ask any questions about Criss again. 
You promise? 
Promise. 
With two "s"s. 
I would, however, like to ask you why Tracy is outside cursing this network on a megaphone. 
It's a good one, Jack. 
Tracy has organized a protest of NBC by his fellow idiots. 
He what? No, no, no, no, no. 
We need idiots. 
You certainly need idiots. 
Who do you think is watching your show? 
Funky taste-makers? 
Black nerds, jet blue passengers who fall asleep with the TV on, pets whose owners have died, and, uh, idiots. 
You need to fix this. 
I don't know what to say to those people. 
You wrote "remember to DVR Kendra" on your hand. 
I think you can handle it. 
Ah, no, damn it. 
Now I gotta pray for a marathon. 
Jiminy Cricket, copyright Walt Disney company, 1940! 
Mr. Hornberger? Sir? 
Pete! 
It's Jenna! 
The woman you're in love with! 
What's wrong with him? 
Is this because of the Mercury? 
What does the box say? 
"For a complete catalog of our lighting products, visit our website." 
We need a computer. 
Poor Mr. Hornberger. 
He came in here to do something for the show, something important, and now look what we've done. 
What you've done. 
You broke the lights. 
We have to get help. 
Are you out of your mind? 
We need to call security, and an ambulance. 
Think, you fool. 
Imagine what the Internet would do with this. 
"Maroney found in closet with unconscious married man and inbred virgin." 
Again? No way. 
I have too much to lose now. 
I am this close to becoming the spokeswoman for the vaginal mesh industry. 
Vaginal mesh. 
Nice try, prolapse. 
Now, if you want to take the fall for this, be my guest. 
But I can't be connected to it in any way. 
Take what fall? 
Oh, please. 
You said it yourself how many rules we've broken. 
"B" and "E", theft and destruction of company property. 
And who knows what we've done to Pete. 
If anyone connects you to this... 
I'll get fired. 
They'd kick me out of the page program faster than a fella can come up with folksy similes. 
No one can know this was our fault. 
But we have to help Mr. Hornberger. 
What do we do? 
I don't know. 
But I know someone who does. 
Talk to me. 
I'm on my way. 
Any idea what bus I take to get there? 
'Cause I'm in Chinatown, baby. 
Hi, this is Tracy's cell phone. 
Dot com, hold the steering wheel. 
I've got to leave my outgoing message. 
What did I just hit? 
Was that a person? 
Is that paint or blood? 
Dot com, this did not happen. 
We take this to our graves! 
Tracy, uh, this is Liz. 
Please call my office. 
My extension, as you have pointed out, spells "anus" with an "I". 
 Hey, what's up? 
 What time you coming home? 
Because I'm... 
 taking you out to dinner What? 
I called sunglass hut and got my credit limit raised to $80, plus, they told me I only needed 5,000 more shades points to get free lens wipes, and I haven't even gotten to the good news yet. 
That's all awesome. 
What happened? 
I got an investor for the truck. 
I went over my whole business plan, guy gave me ten grand. 
Oh, my God. 
Okay, if you got it in cash, we can spread the money out on the bed and kiss on top of it. 
But nothing more. 
And I have a cold sore. 
Damn it. 
No, it's a check. 
But look at it. 
It's beautiful. 
It's him. 
Not cool. 
﻿1 From the director of Valentine's day and New Year's Eve... 
What? Tomorrow is Martin 
Luther king day? 
Yeah, and neither of us have dates. 
Too bad we're just platonic friends. 
 I'm just curious about you   noticed you for quite a while  I have a right to love you. 
Hello. 
In the words of Martin Luther King, I've just got to go for it. 
You're a white supremacist? 
You guys can just do the fun stuff. 
Oh, my God. 
 Uh-uh, oh no All I want is one extraordinary moment. 
 So let's get things started  Sounds like you have a dream. 
 Some time, you're gonna get what you put out  Announcer: It's Martin Luther King day. 
So, I need you to promote that TGS. 
No, I'm not promoting that garbage on the show. 
Oh, Liz. This isn't a request, 
this is an order. 
I've already spoken to Jack about it. 
Wow. 
Well, now I'm going to speak to Jack about it. 
The rest of you, keep working... 
Lemon, I'm sorry, but Jenna has become a huge star for this network. 
She's bigger than Maulik Pancholy on Whitney. 
Look, I put up with a lot from Jenna. 
A couple months ago, she cut off my ponytail because she was jealous of the attention that I was getting, on my own birthday. 
But this is new, going to you behind my back? 
You can't reward her for that. 
My hands are tied. 
But, and I will, heh, never say this again, you have a power that I don't. 
Besides the greatest power of all? 
The ability to gestate life. 
Of course, Lemon. 
That's why the President is always a new mom. 
I was referring to your unique leverage with Jenna: Your friendship. 
No, I like to keep "boss Liz" and "friend Liz" separate, because "boss Liz" is all "paperwork, paperwork," but "friend Liz" is all "my feet hurt, I'm staying in tonight." 
Lemon, I've decided to eliminate the NBC page program. 
What? 
I was in Washington yesterday reviewing satellite images of Avery in North Korea. 
For what it's worth, CIA analysts have confirmed that she is, indeed, "keeping it tight." 
I don't know how this is about my problem, but I trust you. 
I'm getting there. 
While I was in Washington, I learned the house shut down its page program. 
With texting and email, a multi-million dollar system of pleasure slaves is no longer needed. 
Hang on, we need the pages. 
Especially Kenneth. 
He, uh... well, he, uh... 
He always scratches that weird part of my back that I can't reach. 
Unless... 
Oh! 
That's the business! 
Now who's in charge, winter dryness? 
I'm hoping that a bold, cost-cutting move like this will impress Hank Hooper. 
But I've only worked for Hank for a year. 
He's still difficult to read, much like that memoir Reagan wrote the week before he died. 
It's, uh...scattered. 
Well, now I think we're just talking about your thing. 
You tricked me. 
You know how to read Jenna. 
Use your power. 
Oh, damn it. 
I need some tape! 
30 ROCK Ep. 04 - The Ballad of Kenneth Parcell 
Hey, Tray. 
We just picked up your birthday party invitations from the printer. 
Wait! What is this? 
"Give to charity please, no presents"? 
Yeah, that's what you told me to put on the card. 
No, Dotcom! 
I said, "give to charity? 
Please, no. Presents!" 
Well, I'm sorry, but you don't really need presents. 
You already have everything. 
I mean, you just bought Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's bones, and he's not even dead. 
Wow. 
Maybe I do have everything. 
But what does that say about me? 
I need time alone, guys, to think... 
About mortality. 
Hey, buddy. 
I thought maybe we could have a little talk, girl to girl. 
Mm, sure. 
I love light chitchat. 
Did you hear about how my fecalist murdered my kabbalist? 
Wow. 
Look, we're inside, you can take off the sunglasses. 
Oh. 
What are those? 
Leeches. 
They're good for your skin, and I've lost tons of blood weight. 
Oh, my God! 
Okay, remember the pact we made back in Chicago? 
Liz, if I become famous, will you tell me if I start acting weird? 
Definitely. 
And will you do the same for me? 
You? Famous? That's hilarious. 
Well, I'm invoking the pact. 
You're putting leeches on your face. 
Demi Moore does it. 
Plus, it makes P.E.T.A. furious, 
and if P.E.T.A. doesn't 
love you or hate you, you're a nobody, like a soldier, or a teacher. 
Jenna, take off the leeches! 
I feel like I'm losing you. 
I mean, we used to get lunch every week. 
When was the last time we did that? 
You know, with my fecalist in jail, I can eat whatever I want today. 
Maybe we could go to outback... 
I'm going to call ahead and make sure we're in Darryl's section. 
Who am I? 
What does it all mean? 
Will I ever truly be happy? 
Tray, I hate seeing you like this. 
Sitting in here listening to your depressed thoughts CD. 
What is the meaning of ... 
You remember Celia's bakery in the Bronx? 
It was on the corner of Malcolm X Boulevard and guy who shot Malcolm X Boulevard. 
When I was a kid, I wanted one of those pies so bad. 
So I swore to myself that one day I would become so rich I would buy every single pie in Celia's. 
I wanted for nothing as a child, but that brings its own challenges. 
Shut up, Dotcom. 
And now look at that kid, he turned into an incredibly fit genius who has everything he ever wanted. 
So if there's no more to want, what's the point in living? 
Whoa, hang on, Tray. 
You've got a family. 
Great, another thing that I've already got. 
Thanks for making this situation worse. 
Should we get another one? 
If you eat four, you get a T-shirt. 
So one more, and that's two T-shirts. 
Oh, no, they're here. 
And you don't want the paparazzi taking pictures of you? 
Not when I'm just trying to have lunch with my best friend like a normal person. 
It's like I'm in a cage. 
And not the fun kind where you dance while U.S.C. football recruits 
throw hot coins at you. 
I'm sorry, do you want to sneak out the back? 
They'd be expecting that. 
Would you like a chance to be famous, Liz? 
Naturally. Always. 
I'm from Tampa, Florida. 
Leech abuser! 
Nice try, P.E.T.A. bitches. 
But I saw you hiding in the crowd. 
You just threw paint on a nobody, who can't even ♪ sing Make sure you get the outback sign in the shot or I don't get paid. 
Taxi! 
I have good news, and I have bad news. 
The bad news is, I am shutting down the page program. 
The good news is for a different group of people. 
Uh, as the most popular page, I feel I should say something. 
Kenneth, please. 
Everyone knows that Dalton is the most popular page. 
All: Dalton! Dalton! Dalton! 
Fine, but, you can't cancel the page program. 
Who will take messages or seat audiences or order lunch? 
Today, all of those tasks can be managed electronically. 
You're just going to automate us? 
Excuse me, sir, but this reminds me of the tale of John Henry. 
Now, gather 'round friends and... 
We all know about John Henry, Kenneth. 
It's just a story. 
Well then, I know about another story that turned out to be true. 
It's about a virgin who gave birth to a man who had some funny ideas. 
That virgin was my sister. 
And her son, Lyle, has a learning disability. 
Security will escort you out. 
And these uniforms are still the property of NBC, and we'll need them back. 
You are insane! 
You knew that P.E.T.A. guy was there. 
Look, I'm sorry, I couldn't be photographed with paint on me. 
I'd look like you do right now. 
That is psychopath behavior. 
How did I ever even become friends with someone like you? 
If I remember correctly, Elizabeth, we became friends because I felt bad for you, standing alone at that party like a loser. 
Yeah, 'cause I really wanted to talk to the girl who was wrestling in a kiddie pool full of lube. 
Well, what were you even doing at that bachelor party? 
Derek thought I was a guy, and I didn't want to ruin what was happening between us. 
God, I wish my first roommate hadn't died of old age. 
Then you wouldn't have moved in, and I wouldn't have wasted 15 years of my life trying to make you feel better about yourself. 
'Cause guess what? 
The back of your neck does look weird. 
Why would you say that? 
You know I can't see it. 
Oh, forget it. 
I don't need you, Liz. 
I have real friends now, celebrity friends who understand what I'm going through. 
You see? Charlie from 
Charlie bit my finger and Knob Kardashian just texted me. 
They're my new besties. 
Well, I don't need you either. 
I've got a new bestie too, and her name is something cool, like Sam, and she does web design, maybe, and I haven't met her yet. 
Look out, New York, Liz Lemon is 41, covered in paint, and looking for a new best friend. 
Kenneth, you're a hard worker, and I will find you something else here at the company. 
Not interested, sir. 
I don't want to work for an organization that would throw away a tradition like the page program. 
Think of all the famous people who started as pages: Steve Allen, Regis Philbin, Ted Bundy, Richard Ramirez, John Wayne gacy... 
Kenneth, I'm sorry. 
But progress means eliminating useless institutions. 
Well, Mr. Donaghy, there's one 
thing you haven't thought of. 
Who will give the NBC tours? 
No machine can repla... 
We're calling it "notkenneth." 
It's hard not to take that personally, sir. 
We've inputted the entire page handbook into notkenneth's database. 
It knows everything you know, and more. 
Why, Jack, why? 
"Why Jack why?"  
is a 2002 episode of Will and Grace, in which Jack, Sean Hayes, chooses between two YMCAs. 
Featuring guest stars... 
Both: Daniel Day-Lewis as gay benchpress guy. 
Hey, Sue. 
What are you up to tonight? 
I'm not working late again. 
Why don't you write the show yourself? 
You take all the credit anyway. 
I hope you dream of your death. 
I was just wondering if you wanted to go to a movie? 
Oh. I can't. 
I have to work late. 
Hey, Hank. 
I didn't think I was going to see you until dinner tonight. 
Whatever. 
I don't even know if I'm coming. 
Hank, is something wrong? 
Jack, I bought this company a year ago today. 
Now, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but where I come from, anniversaries mean something. 
Hank, of course I remembered our "businessversary." 
I sent a gift. 
Oh, really? 
Was it invisible? 
Sorry. 
I drove all the way up here from Philadelphia listening to Garrison Keillor and just getting psyched for a fun day. 
I used our new messenger system and sent the gift to your office on the 60th floor. 
Ah, it didn't go to 60, it went to 6. 
What's on 6? 
Oh, no! 
Hey, how does an adult make new friends? 
I don't have time for this. 
Hank Hooper's businessversary gift went to TGS. 
TGSis a sketch show known for popular characters like... 
Error. Error. Error. Error. 
Stop! Nerds, stop. 
Stop what you are doing immediately. 
Toofer, put that glass down. 
That scotch fountain obviously was not meant for you. 
Phillie phanatic, get away from him. 
None of this was meant for you. 
That should have been obvious, since a gift from me would suggest that you were producing good work. 
Let me be clear: You are not. 
Lance Ito, you're out of order. 
Line! 
This was meant to go to the 60th floor. 
It's not their fault. 
It says 6th floor on the invoice. 
Must be a computer error. 
Well, somebody made a mistake. 
A dumb mistake. 
And it wasn't the pages, and it wasn't the computer... 
Ha! It was Jack! 
Guys, Jack makes dumb mistakes. 
He's just like us. 
He's no better than I am. 
He's just got a suit. 
No, no, I am better than you, Lutz. 
Someone else is to blame, and I will find him or, more likely, her. 
He looks scared, like Lutz on an escalator. 
Twinsies! 
I called the paps earlier, and they sent Lester. 
No one ever uses him. 
Ugh. I'd like 
to bite his finger. 
Charlie. 
Sweetie, you look amazing. 
Knob Kardashian, Charlie bit my finger, this is mankind. 
And this, is Mr. Socko. 
Oh, I know Mr. Socko. 
Honey, I don't think that was Madame Bovary, I think it was Madame Ovary. 
Oh, no, you went there. 
Man, do my feet hurt in heels sometimes, and other things that women talk about. 
Can we help you? 
Sorry, I'm just trying to make a new best friend. 
All: Oh, sweetie, honey, oh. 
Yeah, it's really hard. 
I mean, how did you guys meet each other? 
We were at karaoke, and we all picked the same song. 
And then when the song came up, we all went on stage. 
And everybody was like, "what?" 
And then we were like,  What you want? 
Baby, I got it  Shut up! 
That's horrible. 
But I get your point. 
I need to go somewhere where someone like me would be hanging out. 
But where does Liz Lemon go when she's out on the town? 
To the Barnes & Noble bathroom. 
Occupied! God. 
I know it is. 
By my new best friend. 
Hey there, Jack. 
That Jenna Maroney sure is a hoot. 
I didn't care for Mr. Socko. 
In my day, socks just kept their mouth shut. 
Well, Hank, you'll be interested to know I'm getting to the bottom of our little gift mix-up earlier. 
Really, Jack? 
There's a problem with the computer system where it confuses 6 and 60? 
I don't like your tone, Rossitano. 
Aw, it's okay. 
You messed up, buddy. 
Lutz, don't touch me. 
Hang on, Jack. 
Are these two very ill children saying you messed up the delivery? 
That's unacceptable. 
Hey, we all make mistakes. 
Like farting when you're talking to three people. 
No, a mistake is something a man does, like going to war without a reason, or executing a simpleton. 
What Jack did is a "whoopsie-daisy," like a baby or a woman would do. 
No, no, Hank. 
It wasn't me, it was the machines. 
Tell him it wasn't my fault. 
My fault, a short-lived NBC game show in which homeless people won money by confessing to crimes they didn't commit. 
Damn you. 
Dam you.A beaver goes to 
college in this 1987 anima... 
Okay, who wants to see the red band trailer of Martin Luther King day? 
No, we need to decide which cell phone pictures I'm going to leak. 
Everyone, listen to Charlie bit my finger's new song. 
 I'm rotten to the core mother...  
Quiet! 
Mankind is trying to tweet about these clowns in Congress. 
Excuse me, guys. 
We're not doing your things, we're doing my me things. 
You mean me, right? 
Exactly: Me. 
 Me? 
 You're all using that word wrong. 
 I'm me. 
 I'm me. 
Uhh! I hate it when they put the movie 
poster on the cover of the book that the movie is based on. 
Let me imagine what Peeta Mellark looks like, and how his arms smell of bread. 
Amy, this is great. 
We are going to be best friends. 
Where should we get dinner? 
I don't trust Sushi, Mexican gives me gas, and I already had a bloomin' onion today. 
Me too. 
Also, Ethiopian is out, because I don't want to see a man with a beard eat with his hands. 
And nothing family style. 
Ah! Why is family 
a selling point? 
Look at the state of the American family. 
Not something we'll ever have to worry about at our age. 
I saw a headline about those amoebas that eat your brain, but I didn't read the article. 
Well, you didn't have time. 
Our lives are half-over. 
Our mothers lied to us. 
Both: Hey, you can't ride a bike on the sidewalk. 
Oh, my God, I am starving. 
We have been wandering around for... 
10 minutes? 
Oh, brother. 
Hanging out with me is awful. 
Amy, we can't both be the negative, judgmental one. 
So what? I'm just supposed 
to sit around and listen to you complain? 
No. You're supposed to be 
so vacant and self-absorbed that you just let me vent without piling on. 
I need Jenna. 
I need Steffi. 
They say people who kill themselves never regret it. 
Tracy. 
Tracy, stop. 
I found something for you to live for. 
I already have a room full of old black women. 
No, Tray, this is Celia Monroe, from Celia's bakery. 
She lives in a nursing home on Long Island now. 
We're all sleeping with Carl, because he has the most puzzles. 
But we tracked her down, and she baked you a banana cream pie, see? 
That's something you didn't have. 
So that means there must be other things I don't have. 
Other reasons to live. 
You guys must have went through a lot of trouble to show me that. 
You must have been upset. 
And I know how that feels, because I've been upset. 
I was very upset when you put "no presents" on my birthday invitations. 
That's what this was about? 
Why didn't you just tell us back in your dressing room? 
Because showing is better than telling, and my schedule is light this week. 
Thank you. 
I never should have treated you the way I did, Liz. 
I need someone who has so little going on in their life, she lets me get all the attention. 
And I need someone in my life who doesn't listen to a word I say. 
Thank you, I just got it cut. 
 Some time, you gonna get what you put out   I try to stay away but I always come back for more  I was wrong. 
I do need you. 
You had me at "I was wrong, I do need." 
I can replace just about everything you do, but no machine could ever be the human wastebasket that I dump my stupid mistakes into. 
Dump, sir. 
Dump all over me. 
You thumb with a wig, those gifts were supposed to go to the 60th floor. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
It was all my fault. 
Good job, Jack. 
Blame it on an albino. 
Classic, 'cause it works. 
I can never replace you guys. 
I love you, presents! 
Ooh. 
I have that. 
And that. 
Oh! 
I've already got this. 
Oh, my goodness. 
I already have this. 
I definitely don't need that. 
Liz, there's someone in the apartment. 
 Someone who thinks you're special   in every single way  I wrote this song to wish you   a happy Valentine's Day  and the chorus goes here  yeah this is where the chorus goes  Criss, I... 
 I didn't have time to write it   but the chorus goes here  Yeah! 
This is the chorus  Criss! Criss, it's okay. 
I really don't care about Valentine's. 
But you're a lady. 
Right? 
Why haven't I seen pictures of you as a baby? 
You know what I like to celebrate on February 14th? 
The 1920 founding of the league of women voters in Chicago, Illinois. 
They were supposed to meet on the 13th, but they all got lost, so... 
But Valentine's Day is fun, Liz. 
I wrote you a song, I found you an awesome clip on Youtube. 
Good morning, everybody. 
I'm hanging out with my friend, John. 
Fox 5 morning news starts... 
Look over there. 
And it starts right now. 
Oh, boy. 
And that's just the beginning. 
All right, Chros, all right. 
What else do you have planned? 
I don't know. 
How about dinner at some place amazing? 
You're kidding, right? 
It's New York, on Valentine's. 
You need a reservation. 
All right, so I'll make one. 
Right now. 
No, it's too late. 
Happy "league of women voters day." 
I've got a better idea. 
I will make you dinner at home. 
Mashed potatoes in a Martini glass, we'll open some of that wine we didn't give the super for Christmas because you decided it would come off as racist. 
I'm glad we gave him those G.E.D. books instead. 
We're gonna use real silverware. 
We're gonna light some candles. 
We'll play the soundtrack to Major League. 
You're making fun of me, but that love song is awesome. 
All in the comfort of our own living room. 
Look, Criss, you need to know what you're up against here. 
I am 0 for 40 on Valentine's Day. 
I will waste you! 
You'll have to go through this old bastard first! 
Bon Jovi. 
No, no, no, no, no, Lemon. 
Liz, you know, my mom did just die. 
Will you be my Valentine? 
I just realized I'm gay. 
If this is going to be "unterrible" for the first time ever, I'm not eating off a coffee table. 
Well, you know, for thousands of years Japanese diners have used traditional tatami mats... 
Okay, no, no, no. 
We'll get a real table. 
But we're going to need one by tonight. 
That leaves us only one option. 
We, as a couple, are going to Ikea. 
Were you playing golf? 
It's freezing out. 
Yes, I was. 
In Avery's absence, I have extra time each day to, how do I put this? 
Release some energy. 
Are we talking about something gross? 
My animus has become pent up. 
Why don't you just come out and say you haven't had "mommy-daddy sheet monster times." 
I'm not about to cheat on the woman I love, and I've never "mommy-daddy sheet monstered" myself. 
Never? Not even during 
the Love Boat reunion? 
Anyway, sorry you're alone. 
I certainly know what it's like to have a crummy Valentine's Day. 
We're not going to chili's until I hit one. 
Go tell the guy the machine's not fast enough. 
I would kill to get hit in the crotch by a baseball today. 
Not only is my wife 12,000 miles away, my mother-in-law has decided to visit. 
No. I've never had 
a mother-in-law, but I have seen Everybody loves Raymond. 
"Debra, where's the figurine I gave you? 
Raymond, I gave Debra a figurine." 
"Ma!" 
The Jessups are very white and very proper. 
The first Jessup moved to this country in 1760 to avoid an embarrassing regifting incident. 
But, my lord, I gave you these dueling pistols last yuletide. 
Yes, of course. 
Now, if you'll excuse me. 
It's been difficult to get Diana to acknowledge the reality of what's happened to her daughter. 
What is she, an Egyptian crocodile? 
'Cause she is in "denial." 
I've had two coffees. 
Anyway, you'll be happy to hear that I am giving Valentine's a second chance this year. 
And here we are on six. 
For the first... 
What a shame. 
It felt like we were just getting started. 
"Ma!" 
30 ROCK S06 Ep. 06 - Hey, Baby, What's Wrong 
Hazel, most people think of Valentine's Day as a celebration of the burning of a catholic loudmouth, but it's also about love. 
And escort prices going way up. 
Okay, so, how appropriate that on Valentine's, I introduce you to the new love of your life: This job, and everyone here. 
This is kind of the nerve center of TGS..., the page desk. 
I've had a desk before. 
I managed a haunted house upstate. 
But, as you know, the haunted house industry is a real boys' club. 
Sure, it's hard, changing careers at my age. 
Well, I wouldn't know anything about being too old for something. 
But here I am, in New York, living at a 24 hour fitness, just ready to be inspired. 
Hazel, right? 
Yeah. 
It's so great to have a woman page here... 
Thanks. 
To test unapproved Japanese medications on. 
Swallow. 
Swallow. 
Good girl. 
Now, let me know if all your pubic hair falls out. 
Oh, my God! 
No, that's what it's supposed to do. 
I want to make sure it doesn't cause seizures. 
Sorry to crash this sausage party... 
Unnecessary. 
But I have an emergency. 
Sebastian, the producer of America's kidz got singing, OD'd last night in Guy Fieri's apartment. 
Oh, my God, that's terrible. 
Terrible for me. 
Oh, my God, that's terrible. 
Tonight's our first live show, I'm singing, and we don't have a line producer. 
So I need to borrow Pete. 
On Valentine's Day? 
No, Pete's got to go home to his wife. 
Actually, Paula didn't want to do anything for Valentine's, so she's just going out to dinner with her tennis instructor, mark. 
Perfect. 
Sound check's at 1:00. 
I'm having Sebastian's lucky earring sent from the morgue. 
Wear it. 
So you're not spending tonight with Paul? 
No, Paul's been performing on a transvestite cruise for the last month. 
It's called "Caribbean queens" for emphasize "No more love on the run". 
Billy Ocean is furious, and very litigious. 
But he's powerless as long as they stay in international waters. 
Sure. 
Since you asked, Criss and I are going to Ikea. 
For the hate-sex after your fight? 
Good idea. 
No, we're not going to fight. 
We're getting one thing. 
I have a plan... 
you're going to fight. 
Ikea's where I used to go pick up newly-single vulnerable chicks. 
I've gotten women there two, three points hotter than me. 
So, you know...fours. 
Look, I don't want to go. 
But we need a table. 
And if Criss thinks he's the guy to get Liz Lemon on board with "Saint lame-entine's nay"... 
Honey, that sucks. 
We better be able to survive a simple trip to Ikea. 
No, Liz, don't test it. 
Especially this early in a relationship. 
It's like when Mickey Rourke tested his catapult on me. 
I was almost listening. 
Where are you going? 
You never take my advice. 
Ms. Maroney. 
Thank you, Kenneth. 
We'll take a pube count, but it doesn't feel worth it. 
Maybe I'm hitting them too hard. 
And I should not have walked past that sporting goods store where the mannequins have nipples. 
And what race were those mannequins, because their skin was gray. 
They were like faceless sex aliens. 
Jack. 
Diana, you're here, I thought you'd be at the house. 
Yes, I dropped my bags off and shook hands with the baby, but I wanted to come talk to you about Avery's situation. 
What situation is that? 
According to your Christmas letter, Avery is in Asia on business. 
You know that she was kidnapped by the north Korean secret police. 
Don't be vulgar. 
As we said in the letter, she'll be back soon with some charming Asian ceramics. 
I'm sorry, but who is this "we" you keep referring to? 
Your husband has been dead for 15 years. 
Wonderful news. You know 
our pacing horse, squanto? 
She's foaling in the spring. 
Diana, I know the Jessups don't like to talk about unpleasant matters. 
But sometimes I feel like I'm the only person trying to get Avery back. 
Well, that is what I wanted to discuss. 
It has been months, and I feel like nothing has happened. 
Diana, extracting an American from North Korea is a, uh... 
Is a lot more difficult than organizing a round-Robin paddle tennis tournament. 
What about organizing three round-Robin paddle tennis tournaments? 
I heard that one of them was a disaster. 
Who told you that? 
Bebe Butler? 
She's trying to destroy me. 
This situation has become embarrassing. 
One of Frederick's old Washington friends has some connections with the Transylvanian consulate at the united nations. 
I made an appointment for both of us. 
Let me stop you right there. 
I've been to the U.N. 
repeatedly. 
Mein herr, meine frau Avery Jessup... 
Kim Jong-Il vuvuzela Charlize Theron... 
Boomerang my Sheila back to her Joey, mate. 
And it's gotten me nowhere. 
The U.N. is 
a useless organization, with a ridiculous army. 
Robin's egg blue helmets? 
Great camouflage, if you're invading an easter egg hunt. 
Jack, perhaps you're not having success because of that attitude. 
I find you catch more flies with honey. 
First of all, why do you want flies? 
Our appointment is at 11:00. 
Strewth, what a bull-dingered Valentine's Day. 
And Jack? 
I speak Australian. 
Let ferry ride, was the first time when we've ever been on a boat together. 
Unless you count that time when the goose chased you into the Central Park boat pond. 
Criss, I need to ask you something. 
Have you ever been to an Ikea? 
Do you know what we're walking into? 
You know what? 
I like myself. 
I have good taste in drapes. 
I wish I'd died on Iwo Jima and never met you. 
What was that? 
Not us. 
We are a good team, and we have a plan. 
We're going to go in, get the kurtz with the birch veneer, and then get out. 
Then go home and have an amazing night together. 
I just got my period. 
Liz, what are you worried about? 
Come on, this is gonna be fun. 
I'm going back to those cute bowls. 
I swear to God, I will stab you! 
So tense. 
Just like my mom's back. 
Dude, what was that? 
I just don't want to be alone today. 
In 48 years, I haven't had one good Valentine's. 
Man, if I weren't with Lynn now we could team up. 
Valentine's Day is the perfect time to meet vulnerable women. 
It's scumbag Christmas! 
Just tell me what to do. 
Look, guys like us have to pick low-hanging fruit. 
We look like Far side drawings. 
So we go where women are sad, desperate, and weak... 
Cat shelters, blood banks, the ice cream stand at a Celtic woman concert... 
And we strike. 
Another good place is the beauty salon, where white girls try to do black hair. 
Sisters come out crying, feeling all bad about themselves, and we walk up on them all, "Hey, baby, what's wrong?" 
You're married, I actually have a girlfriend, all our dirtbag knowledge is going to go to waste. 
No, it's not. 
Lutz, prepare for the adventure of a lifetime. 
Then after we watch Fievel goes west, we're gonna get you some action. 
Hey, you needed to see me? 
Did you book a female hair-person for me tonight? 
Who's Karen? 
I need someone named Trentence, or Orbino. 
Get in the game, Pete. 
Your star is freaking out. 
What are you freaking out about? 
You sing live all the time. 
This is different. 
It's not some rinky-dink late night show that a bald idiot produces. 
It's the largest audience I've ever performed for. 
And after spending all season ripping cute kids new ones, everyone wants me to fail. 
Tomorrow night on America's kidz got singing, the judge becomes the opposite of the judge. 
Come on, guys, a little effort. 
Jenna Maroney's singing live, and all of America is just waiting for that To get  over and over and over again with a. 
Nice bleeping. 
Sorry about earlier. 
Jenna, you need to relax. 
Listen up, if tonight isn't a huge "jiumph," which is short for "Jenna triumph," it's on you. 
And like all celebrities, I'm very good at shifting the blame. 
I attacked Nancy Kerrigan. 
 Did you get my message? 
 Yes, your excellency. 
And I also wish you, a "bear-y" happy Valentine's Day. 
He said it'll be another hour. 
The assistant attache has a few minutes around 14:30. 
14:30? You do know that this 
office is in America, right? 
Do you see a 14 on my watch? 
Yes, it's the date. 
Happy Valentine's Day. 
That's cute. 
And what insolvent country do you come from? 
New Jersey. 
I'm just a weirdo. 
Will you please stop being so hostile? 
You just make everything worse. 
No wonder you haven't accomplished anything. 
You know what? 
Avery loved a good fight. 
She used to call the cable company and dispute our bill, just for the sport of it. 
She wouldn't stand for this dog and pony show. 
I have organized several dog and pony shows, and I'm offended by what you're implying. 
How are you Avery's mother? 
We have a few things in common, Jack. 
We both married much, much older men, which can be hard, or, more often, flaccid. 
I have an idea. Maybe, 
we just don't talk at all. 
Maybe we sit quietly and read our, soccer magazine. 
Mr. Jordan's lizard, Jeremy, 
is always escaping and biting everyone. 
Like owner, like lizard. 
Oh, man. 
That's why Mr. Jordan got him 
a GPS collar. 
Now it's easier to find... 
Well that can't be. 
It says he's inside the room. 
Maybe you're reading it wrong? 
Three feet, two feet, it says he's right on top of us. 
Oh, my God, my face. 
He's mating with my mouth. 
He likes you! 
Here's a good one. 
Go to a strip club on Father's Day, and shout things like, "I'm proud of you!" 
Classic. 
Where's Pete? 
I just dyed my gums because I want them to pop on camera. 
But now they're burning. 
Another way to meet damaged women is to hang out with actresses. 
Actresses? 
Where? How young are they? 
I'll do nudity. 
Back in the day, used to work as a stock boy in a chic uptown department store, called "Ray-Ray's discount clothes bucket." 
I would go to the swimsuit section and switch the tags. 
I'd take a size six and put a size twelve sticker on it. 
And then some thick girl would try to squeeze into it, and come out of the dressing room like, "I've gotten bigger. 
Why do I even bother dieting?" 
And I'm all like, "Hey, baby, what's wrong?" 
You know, a great place to meet vulnerable women is weight watchers. 
I did "watchers" to stay pageant-fit, but it was too much math for a six-year-old. 
Thank God I found cigarettes. 
"Weight watchers," got it. 
And if worse comes to worse, make the lady feel vulnerable. 
Check this out. 
Baby, did someone throw cereal on you? 
Let's get you out of these wet clothes. 
What is wrong with you people? 
Whatever. 
Jeremy says she's a tease anyway. 
Now, let's hit weight watchers. 
How is there no signal in here? 
Silence, prisoner. 
I mean, can I help you, valued customer? 
There you are. 
What are you doing? 
Buying stuff for tonight, to make it awesome. 
Look, salt and pepper shakers. 
You put them together, it makes a heart. 
Take them apart, two red sperms. 
We're not getting that. 
What's with the "neggy" vibes, jeez. 
I can get things. 
Not if you're not paying for them. 
Let's go get that table, buddy. 
Ikea. 
First things first. 
I am from Transylvania, but I am not a vampire. 
I'm just a night owl with a terrible garlic allergy. 
So, this is regarding that boy who went missing in my castle? 
No, we're here about my wife. 
My daughter, Avery Jessup, she's in North Korea. 
Yes, the Jessup case. 
Yes, I would like to speak to Kim Jong-Un, immediately. 
That is unacceptable. 
I understand. 
The operator wouldn't let me dial long-distance. 
So, thank you both for coming. 
No. 
That is exactly what I expected would happen. 
Does that hurt? 
Well, I'm so sorry. 
Well that is just the beginning, you...penis! 
This isn't some idiotic civil war in some country without oil. 
This is my favorite daughter. 
And she is a beautiful white American. 
So why the fudge isn't everyone fudging freaking the fudge out! 
She's right. 
You are a penis! 
I'm going to call security. 
One of the guys has a whistle. 
Vampire push. 
Did you just threaten her? 
I want you to apologize to this woman, right now. 
I am a very powerful man. 
I can see to it that Transylvania never sees another episode of Friends. 
No! Monica and Chandler just 
slept together in London. 
I'm... I'm sorry. 
Okay. Now admit 
the U.N. is useless. 
It is. Half the building 
is a laser tag arena. 
Admit it's annoying when Bono comes around. 
It's the worst. 
Every time he says he's not hungry when we collect money for pizza, and then he eats, like, three slices. 
You disgust me. 
Come on, let's go. 
And, Cjokula, at Monica and Chandler's wedding, Rachel's the one who is pregnant. 
Finally, tables. 
Stop walking so close to me! 
I'm sorry. 
It's this place. 
But also, if you would just let me get a few steps ahead of you first, and then you walk? 
I found it. 
Nice. 
What? 
It's nice, it's just... 
I don't know if I'm feeling it, you know? 
What about this idea? 
I know a guy who cuts glass... 
No. I took measurements, 
I looked at colors, we came here. 
This is the plan. 
Yeah, it's just that this table, it feels kind of uptight. 
And I think something a little more fun would be a better table, for me. 
Well, I don't know, Criss. 
Maybe a more fun table wouldn't be as supportive. 
What? No, no, 
we are not doing this. 
We are not letting this table be a metaphor for our relationship. 
That's what Ikea wants us to do. 
I'm just not sure my chair wants to be with this table. 
Why, because deep down your chair would rather be with other chairs? 
I think the table needs to stop listening to its mother. 
Well, it's just the table thinks the chair takes too many camping trips with Richard. 
Almost there, teammate. 
To the warehouse! 
Seriously?  
"Zoo York." 
Okay, everybody, sound check for Ms. Maroney. 
No, I don't want a live band. 
Live bands make mistakes. 
Pete, I have made love to Alfonso, he can't keep rhythm, get him out of here. 
That's a wrap on Alfonso. 
Alfonso Disparioso, everybody. 
This is your moment. 
The world breathes for you. 
I love you, myself. 
And playback. 
Jenna, you're not singing. 
Yes, I am. 
I'm sorry I was such an Italian in there, but that was unacceptable. 
No, you were wonderful. 
The way your eyes went dead, just like Avery's. 
I didn't know you had that in you. 
"Yosemite Sam" was based on my grandfather, so yes, I do have a temper. 
There are a lot of things you don't know about me, Jack. 
In 1978, I was in Playboy, just wearing a necktie and holding hands with a black girl. 
How could I have ever said that you're not your daughter's mother. 
Those incredible cheekbones, like an evil Disney queen. 
No, I misjudged you. 
The way you broke that man down like a folding table at a dog and pony show. 
And I am sorry I compared you to my late husband. 
You are not some liver-spotted old man constantly spilling hot tea in his lap until his whole crotch was useless. 
Useless! 
You are young. 
You are virile. 
Your hair, like a lion's mane. 
My eyes, like two pools of ice water. 
Let's keep walking, in the cold. 
Yes. 
Do you like baseball? 
Let's talk about baseball. 
I love baseball. 
Abner Doubleday. 
 The bats are long and hard. 
 The gloves are girls. 
 Balls! 
 Jeter's thighs in those pants. 
New topic. 
You know, it's funny. 
If those teeth were in your vagina, you'd be considered a monster. 
Well, Jenna, there's nothing physically wrong with you. 
That's impossible. 
Why can't I sing? 
Well, it must be psychosomatic. 
Don't worry, that's just a fancy doctor word for "your brain is broken." 
Unfortunately, there's no field of medicine that deals with the brain. 
But, I can give you a pamphlet for a cult. 
You don't understand. 
This is how I make my living. 
Like me and my cell phone bedazzling. 
I have to be able to sing. 
Maybe you're shutting down because of all the pressure. 
There is a lot riding on this performance. 
Pressure? That's ridiculous. 
Pressure is trying to pass for four when you just turned seven, at the "Miss Toddler Panama city" pageant. 
You're crammed into the same five-inch heels you wore the year before, blood pooling in your toes. 
But you know if you don't win, mom can't fix the hole in the gator fence, so you'll be up all night, stabbing gators. 
Pressure is performing on a party boat that catches on fire, your throat burning from the smoke. 
You still sing so beautifully that it calms the passengers, so that you and the crew can escape. 
Pressure... 
It's the "Rule of threes," Pete. 
Is singing the Yemeni national anthem while a handsome but ruthless general pushes a scimitar into your neck, Kristin Chenoweth's corpse at your feet. 
That's pressure. 
This live show is nothing. 
Well, there's something weird going on here. 
You feel that sexual energy too? 
I mean, but... it would 
be wrong to act on it. 
Well, it's 5:00 somewhere. 
No, this isn't happening. 
They're sold out. 
This is why you don't just choose one option. 
We were in a room full of tables. 
No, this is why you don't waste 45 minutes wandering around the "Valentine's marketplace." 
Trying to find stuff for tonight. 
For you. 
Really cool stuff. 
You still have those salt and pepper shakers, don't you? 
Well, I don't want them anymore. 
'Cause I'm not feeling romantic. 
God, you actually got me excited about today. 
Valentine's is the worst! 
It's even worse than earth day. 
You just see so many dirty feet in sandals. 
I don't know, Liz. 
This could have been special. 
I had stuff planned. 
No, you didn't. 
You wrote half a song, and thought you'd "wing it," like you do with everything. 
I mean, if you'd had a plan we wouldn't even be in this hellhole. 
Good, go wide with it. 
Go. 
Really? 
Well, how's your super-planned life going, Liz? 
You're 40-something... 
One! Come on, Criss. 
You have no kids. 
The only thing you like about your job is taking home free sodas. 
And you're attacking the only good thing in your life because of a stupid table. 
This isn't about the table. 
This is about you never following through on anything, ever. 
It's why you didn't finish law school, it's why you still aren't done filling out your 2010 census. 
Well what race am I supposed to check? 
We all come from Africa. 
You know what? 
Ikea tested us, we failed. 
Okay, just go. 
That's a good idea. 
We're done here. 
Yeah, we are definitely done. 
Thank you. 
That's why I get out of the nidurgangur in the morning. 
It's one of our cheaper beds. 
There you are. 
I think your break is over, Ms. Wassername. 
Did I make a mistake, Kenneth? 
A big mistake. 
Tracy Jordan threw milk at you, and you didn't even thank him? 
How does that reflect on the page program? 
And our mascot, "Pagey," a piece of paper. 
Everyone here is awful. 
I need to be inspired. 
I came here to start a glamorous new life. 
'Cause today, anyone can be famous. 
I mean, look at foxy knoxy. 
What did she ever do besides not kill anybody? 
So, why not me? 
I could have a fragrance, or a line of children's handbags, or be in a reality show with other kooky dumb sluts. 
You don't think I have dreams? 
Last night, I dreamed a baby ate my hair. 
But sometimes, you have to start at the bottom. 
I'd like for you to make a delivery for me. 
And, while you're out, think about how your page underwear has been handed down, page to page, for over 70 years. 
 So, do you like music? 
 Yes. 
I have supported the Baltimore Philharmonic for years. 
These days, it's just a boom box and a guy in a crab costume. 
He gets shot out of a Cannon at Ravens Games. 
The city may not be thriving. 
Well, it's not just Baltimore. 
We live in a benighted age. 
The last time I heard classical music on television was Schubert's final sonata in a commercial. 
Now why would anyone use music written by a man dying of syphilis to sell douches. 
Because people are getting stupider. 
Think how much Schubert accomplished in the 31 years he was alive. 
Coming through. 
And then there's, this guy. 
My taxes are paying for your healthcare! 
Do a sit-up! 
I really underestimated you, Jack. 
Maybe we shouldn't talk at all. 
How do you think our boys are doing in there? 
I guess it's been a pretty rough week. 
Yesterday, I ate all the cheese out of the mouse traps. 
Now, who'd like to continue this magic over drinks? 
A Cosmo's five points? 
Okay. 
All right. 
Hey, baby, what's wrong? 
Nothing's wrong, you think something's wrong with me? 
What's wrong with you? 
Um, didn't the white lady just mess up your hair? 
I work for the post office, I was delivering a package. 
But you think my hair's messed up? 
No, I... 
You're gonna tell me about black lady hair, you "Louie Anderson" little bitch? 
Run! Run for your life! 
Hi. 
Are you shopping for someone? 
Do you know what size she is? 
No. I don't know. Maybe. No. 
I see. 
It's okay. 
I have an Uncle who uses my discount here all the time. 
I'll take it. 
Okay, Jenna. 
I think I know what your problem is. 
It's the "yips." 
When will congress pass a law to get those bastards out of our country? 
No, no. The "yips" 
is something that happens to athletes. 
They get in their heads, and stop being able to do stuff they've done a million times. 
Like, bet me during a poker game at Tony Romo's house? 
I know you don't think it's mental, but it is. 
And, I get it. 
 It's scary to admit... 
 How would you know? 
Because it happened to me! 
I was the best they'd ever seen, and I blew it! 
Peter Hornberger, a shoo-in for this Olympic squad, about to arch. 
You're going to want to watch this, folks, so put down your Rubik's cube, turn off that Yakov Smirnoff standup tape, and set all your swatches to right now. 
I've been shot! 
Someone run into town and find a payphone! 
This happened to you? 
We have something in common? 
Look, tonight is huge for you, and for me. 
If this goes well, it could get us both out of the late-night ghetto. 
Because you and me? 
We're prime-time, baby. 
Fine, it's mental. 
I have the "yips." 
What am I supposed to do? 
Okay, we don't have a lot of time. 
So, maybe just by acknowledging the problem, we fixed it? 
I think we did. 
I'm cured! 
It's worse. 
I can't open my mouth. 
Happy Valentine's to the two lovers. 
Come into my restaurant for the romance. 
No, no, no, we're not together. 
What? 
But, this is a crime. 
Such a beautiful, age-appropriate couple. 
You are perfect together. 
You are like pasta, and a mouth. 
Do you not think that she's beautiful? 
Yes, empirically she is attractive. 
And is he not handsome, with hair like black vermicelli? 
Yes, he is handsome, but... 
The only "but" we speak of tonight, is the butt of the human ass. 
Valentine's, she is a celebration of love, and sex, and touch. 
Come inside, and have the most romantic notte of your lives. 
We have a unisex bathroom, with, come si dice, no lock, and extra mirrors. 
I have to go check on Liddy. 
I have to go walk around the park. 
Maybe forever. 
Darn it, what am I doing wrong? 
This is it, Lutz. 
The Ikea parking lot. 
If you can't close the deal here, you're on your own. 
Back in the day, you know how many women me and Lamar Odom's dad picked up here? 
And keep in mind, back then this was a marsh, where people came to shoot at fish. 
There's your low-hanging fruit. 
We can teach you no more. 
Fly, Lutz, fly. 
Hey, baby, what's wrong? 
Lutz? 
Mom-boss? 
What are you doing? 
Oh, my God, Lutz just hit on Liz. 
About time. 
The last six years has been like watching Moonlighting. 
Hang on, were you hitting on me? 
I'm sorry. 
I just wanted to have a nice Valentine's Day, so Frank and Tracy tried to help me out. 
But I keep screwing up. 
Every time I get a good thing going, I do something stupid and blow it. 
You want to know the reason why Lutz is alone? 
Lutz! 
And Dollhouse penis syndrome. 
Oh, my God. 
I'm female Lutz. 
I love you too. 
No, I mean... 
I'm my own worst enemy. 
Do you want to know the reason Liz is alone? 
Liz. 
Also I menstruate a lot. 
Oh, God, does this mean I have to change? 
I have to go back and be the bigger person? 
What if Criss already left and I have to go find him? 
It's so cold. 
Oh, realizations are the worst. 
Excuse me, are you Jenna Maroney? 
My goodness, are these for me? 
Yes. 
For your grave. 
I hope you die out there tonight. 
Dude, that was a disaster. 
Worse than me trying to send a fax. 
50 straight Valentine's days alone. 
I mean, 48. 
Are you crazy? 
You're not alone. 
You spent Valentine's with us. 
Yeah, two people who care enough about your sexual needs to blow off their wives and girlfriends. 
No. 
Right now, Angie's in a hotel room dressed as a clown. 
And I'm supposed to get into an elephant costume and interview her for a job at the circus. 
I spent Valentine's Day with friends. 
Friends? 
We are work acquaintances at best. 
At worst, we are rivals who inspire and try to make each other better. 
Now let's go get some tiny meatballs. 
Meatballs, here we come! 
Meatballs! 
Pick up your phone, Criss. 
Jack, I can't talk. 
I am mentally writing an apology, and it's giving me a tension headache, and I am so cold! 
I want to have sex with Avery's mother. 
No! You can't do that. 
I know. 
And maybe it's just the loneliness, and the frustration, and stupid Valentine's Day. 
But she's amazing. 
And come on, didn't our friends the ancient Olmecs bed both mother and daughter to satisfy their Jaguar gods? 
 And everybody loves them. 
 Jack, listen to me. 
That is wrong on so many levels. 
You can never sleep with her, never, never, ever, ever... 
Never, ever, ever. 
Never, ever, ever, ever! 
I get it, Lemon. 
Thank you. 
Just hearing your labored breathing while you walk up stairs has purged me of all sexual desire. 
Yeah, well, glad I could help. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to clean up the mess I made here with... 
Criss. 
You're still here. 
I tried to call you. 
20 missed calls? 
How did... 
Right. 
My ringtone is the sounds of cooking. 
Which is perfect, because I love cooking. 
But when I'm cooking... 
Lemon, please hang up, I can't listen to any more of this. 
Yeah. 
Look... 
I was planning on saying "it was my fault," and, "please, let's get back together." 
But, it doesn't look like I need to. 
What do you mean, "get back together"? 
You thought we broke up because of that fight? 
No, that would be idiotic. 
You wanted a table, I wasn't super-helpful. 
Who cares? 
I tend to care, you know... 
I let little things ruin stuff. 
I mean, I stopped shopping at kmart because I found out that Kathy Ireland didn't design any of her signature socks. 
But maybe, after 40 years... 
41. 
 I can change. 
 Don't bother. 
You can get mad at dumb stuff. 
That's your thing. 
I'll get over it. 
That's my thing. 
It's kind of perfect. 
But how are we ever going to break up? 
I don't know, maybe we never will. 
Maybe we'll still be celebrating Valentine's together 100 years from now. 
Do you think our ape overlords will let us? 
They'll let you and me do whatever we want, because we'll be spying on the rest of humanity for the ape police. 
Wait, where did you get a table? 
I made it. 
I gathered fallen tree branches from Riverside Park. 
That's where we first met. 
Yeah. And the top 
is a Herman Cain poster I found in a dumpster. 
Excuse me? 
I have a package for Liz Lemon. 
Sure, come in. 
You're the head writer TGS? 
But you're so beautiful. 
Charlie what now? 
I love your brown hair. 
It's so bouncy, like the "after" picture in a lice ad. 
Thank you. 
It's from intermittent washing. 
And you own this place? 
Yeah. 
Holy Moly, there's stairs? 
And a dining room table? 
Is this your boyfriend? 
Yeah. He made me dinner. 
Mashed potatoes in a Martini glass. 
Who are you, the president? 
Of France? 
I know, right? 
You are an inspiration, Liz Lemon. 
I am an inspiration. 
I'll see you at work tomorrow. 
Happy Valentine's Day. 
You too. 
I want your life. 
And I will have it. 
I like her. 
 45 seconds. 
 Jenna. 
This is a nightmare. 
My Nemeses, Abigail Breslin and the woman from those progressive insurance commercials, are in the audience. 
Just, relax... panic, don't. 
You failed me, Pete. 
And when I go down, I'm taking you with me. 
You'll never work again. 
But I have five kids. 
And grandkids can't be far behind, little Evelyn's so sexual. 
30 seconds. 
These shoes hurt, mommy. 
Good. Focus on the pain, 
not on the fact that if you lose, I'm gonna pour acid on your Barbies. 
Okay, come on. 
The shoes. 
The fire. 
The sword. 
It's the pain. 
She needs the pain to distract her. 
I need to hurt her, but she's all the way over there. 
How could I possib... 
Come on, Hornberger. 
Archer... 
Arch! 
Is she bleeding? 
It looks like an arrow wound. 
Jack. 
I didn't know you'd be down here. 
Nice place. 
What did you pay for all this wood? 
I don't believe we've met. 
Jack, this is... 
Someone I saw fighting with a dog outside a liquor store. 
I'm Herb. 
'Cause you are what you smoke, right "Jackie"? 
Hey, where's the head? 
We're in mixed company, but let's just say I've got to go wreck your toilet. 
It's down that hallway on the right-hand side. 
Diana, don't do this. 
I'm lonely, Jack. 
So am I. 
Believe me, I know how you feel. 
Being alone on Valentine's Day, frustrated in all kinds of ways. 
Just wanting a connection, to hold someone's hand. 
Ideally when she's wearing only a necktie. 
But you deserve better than Herb. 
Why is this bathroom full of wine bottles? 
But what I deserve, I shouldn't have. 
Me neither. 
So, what are we going to do about it? 
 Oh, baby. 
 Oh, yes. 
 Yes!  
 That's good. 
 Yes. 
 Oh, yeah, don't stop. 
 Just like that. 
 Oh, yeah, but a little lower. 
 Yes! 
 Yeah, baby! 
 Oh, yeah! 
 Oh! 
 Nope, nope. 
 Let me have one. 
Give it to him, Frank. 
Give it to him, we're friends. 
You can have one of mine. 
Finally, I can say, happy Valen... 
My legs! 
This get me out of sex. 
My God, Liz. 
We're wearing the exact same lipstick. 
Looks better on you, of course. 
I wish I could just cut those lips right off and wear them. 
Happy Valentine's Day, lovers. 
Happy Valentine's Day to us all. 
﻿1 Randi, now that Barbara's dead, I need a nanny. 
That's perfect! 
All my children were taken away. 
Can you believe that D'Fwan is telling you that Angie is starting her own clothing line? 
Why don't you control your dog? 
He controls me! 
Hello, Angie... 
I mean, hello, whoever it is going to be. 
Hi, Jack, it's Angie. 
I wanted to remind you we have a meeting today about my fashion line. 
Looking forward to it. 
We can do a lot of cross-promotion between our shows and your clothing brand, uh, Cheek. 
It's pronounced "chic". 
It's French. 
Now that I'm a fashion designer, I'm an octuple threat... 
Reality star, actress, singer/song-reader, perfumist, IBS survivor, best-selling author of a book I didn't write, catchphrase coiner. 
"I'll take that with cheese." 
Well they don't all work. 
Cheek is stretchable formal wear for elegant plus-sized women and huskier gays. 
Tonight is the big fashion show for cheek's summer line. 
I find that my target customer sweats a lot and often gets thrown into a public pool. 
Now this show is the... 
Angie, I'm sorry, but I have to take this other call. 
What? 
No, you don't... 
Rude! 
This is Jack Donaghy. 
This is Sam Lockwood with the State Department. 
I'm stunned. 
The CIA captured a North Korean spy. 
So we were able to arrange a prisoner swap next week. 
In exchange for my wife, they get their spy back, a crate of Hollister sweatshirts and a signed headshot of Don Johnson. 
They just got Nash Bridges. 
Obviously, this is a very personal matter, so I would appreciate it if your guys at Bravo... 
Excuse me, "gays" at Bravo... 
Handle this with the same delicacy with which you handled D'Fwan's boyfriend's pregnancy scare. 
It's my way till pay day. 
Where is he? 
Jack Donaghy is late for our meeting. 
Not to be racist, but white guys are typically punctual. 
I'm sorry I got so real, but nothing's gonna change unless there's a dialogue. 
I've never been so disrespected in my life. 
And I've gone to and worked at the post office. 
Mrs. Jordan, Mr. Donaghy 
sends his apologies, but he is unable to attend your meeting. 
I'm here as his representative. 
Oh, no. 
That man is about to get some cheese with that. 
That catchphrase is improving, baby! 
You don't give me notes! 
Hey, girlfriend. 
Looks like you need a girlfriend. 
I have a girlfriend. 
Her name is Raven-Symone Senior. 
I'm really close to the whole Q of cast. 
So I know they're gonna pull me into all of their drama and I'm gonna be on the show a lot. 
I will be on the show a lot. 
 Where's Jack? 
 Boob monster! 
I'm supposed to have a meeting with Jack Donaghy. 
Do you not know where your own husband is? 
I know they're not married. 
I just like them to know I don't give a  about their lives. 
Jack's probably busy, Angie. 
His wife was kidnapped, but now she's coming back, and all these cameras are around, so they've been following him everywhere. 
Uhhuh. 
I see what's happening. 
Jacks' not just blowing me off. 
He's trying to ruin my big night. 
No, Angie, what's happening with him is cra... 
No, what's happening is the cheek fashion show. 
That's what people wanna know about. 
And Tracy's planning a huge surprise for me at the end. 
Really? What is it? 
I don't know, Liz. 
It's a surprise. 
Do you know what a surprise is? 
Now you do. 
You didn't have a drink. 
Wha? 
Shh! 
Don't learn to talk. 
A woman's power comes from her silence. 
 You're Liz, right? 
 Hey, Randi. 
Great episode last week. 
I thought it was very brave of you to pose for Playboy against Playboy's wishes. 
I need a date to Angie's fashion show and Tracy tells me that you're, you know, the village bicycle. 
What? No. 
Why would he say that? 
Doctor guy, pilot guy, Cleveland dude, British guy, rich dude, James Franco. 
I've been with the same woman for 22 years. 
No judgments, but to me, Liz Lemon is a sex maniac. 
Well, a lady never goes anywhere without a date. 
 Can someone watch Virginia? 
 I can't. 
Contractually, I can only hold beautiful black babies in benetton ads. 
And I don't know if I should. 
'Cause I'm might bite these fat little legs. 
I might eat them up, they're so fat and juicy. 
No, Sam, the military brings her back. 
Don't even let Clinton know about this. 
He and Steve Bing will break out their sex plane. 
It is a sex plane. 
There aren't even any seats. 
It's just futons and jacuzzis. 
I've gotta run, Sam. 
Jack I... 
God, what is this? 
Oh, it's just one of our shows. 
They're following me today. 
Ugh, is this one of those ridiculous reality shows like Ken Burns's jazz? 
Disgusting. 
I'm sorry, Diana. 
Ignore them. 
Eventually, you won't even know they're here. 
I'm just a little overwhelmed right now. 
I could use a drink. 
I'm afraid that while we're on camera, I can only offer you D'Fwan's boutique wine, "d'fwine". 
D'fwine. 
Please d'fwink responsibly. 
To Avery's return. 
I'm a part of this as well. 
I played Avery in the TV movie, Kidnapped by danger. 
Jenna, this is for family only. 
Now you sound like the cops outside of Jackie O's funeral. 
But I got in there and sang almost all of Hey big spender. 
 ♪ The m... 
 Jenna, this is inappropriate. 
I suggest you go back to whatever Florida bathroom you crawled out of. 
I can see I'm not wanted here. 
But thank you for looking up on Wikipedia that I was conceived on a toilet. 
No one wants me in their story. 
If a beautiful woman cries and no one hears it, did she waste $700 on crying lessons at Adrian Brody's unaccredited acting school? 
Jack, when Avery does get back, I don't think we should tell her about us. 
Oh,  I want to make sure we all we're very clear about what my mother in law said in my office. 
She said we shouldn't tell Avery about Gus. 
Gus is someone I've gone into business with and Avery wouldn't approve of him. 
Why would she disapprove? 
Uh, well, uh, because they dated... at Yale. 
Gus was a Professor. 
Of course you'll meet him. 
We do business all the time. 
Tracy, I know you're planning a big romantic surprise for me at the end of the fashion show. 
But Jack Donaghy is messing with my special day. 
So whatever you were thinking about doing, double it. 
Call Mo'nique. 
Do a dove release. 
Parachute in and propose to me all over again, you hear? 
Angie, I wasn't even gonna go to your fashion show. 
It's at 8:00, which is 9:00 am Tokyo time. 
That's when Takashi's parents leave for work and we play mass effect 3 online. 
Mr. and Mrs. Tanaka 
think he's at school, but he's playing video games with a drunk adult. 
Now I know you're just saying that because you don't want to ruin the surprise 'cause you're a good husband. 
Oh, my God. 
Ned Stark is dead? 
I love my wife. 
I want her to be happy. 
But more than that, I'm gonna do nothing. 
It's hard trying to have it all. 
You wait here, Bernardo. 
She bit my . 
Eew. 
My glasses. 
It's work. It's work. 
But she is at such a fun age. 
You get so much out of it. 
It's fine, I'm fine. 
If everything goes according to plan, Avery will be back in a few days. 
In the meantime I have a lot of work to do... 
With Gus, my business partner, whom Diana mentioned earlier. 
Gus, there's Gus. 
Why are you wearing the hat I asked you not to wear any more to our meetings? 
We're higher up here, so the sun's electricity is stronger. 
Well, uh, let's go over the numbers, Gus. 
As you can see, the numbers look pretty good. 
We're under budget and in line with projections. 
Great, well, uh, meeting over. 
You probably shouldn't have even filmed that, it was so boring. 
Oh, Diana, you remember Gus, whom you said we shouldn't tell Avery about because she used to date him. 
She was nasty. 
She loved pee. 
 Thank you, Gus. 
 No, Jack. 
I didn't say Gus. 
I already explained to them what I said. 
I said I did not want Avery to know about Rus. 
In slavic myth, Rus is the founder of Russia. 
Why can't Avery know about the mythological founder of Russia? 
Because Jack has invested a lot of money in a restaurant I'm opening called "Rus". 
It is Russian cuisine. 
Who doesn't love cold, purple soup? 
Diana, we're talking about the same thing, because, as you know, the restaurant Rus is the business venture I'm engaged in with Gus. 
Right, he is the chef. 
As I mentioned earlier, he's a Professor at Yale. 
Which is funny, because he looks so much more like a chef. 
Oh, what's funniest... 
Is that's he's both. 
And now he works at the restaurant we can't tell Avery about. 
And the grand opening is tonight. 
Now he's opening up a restaurant the same night my line launches? 
Oh, that is a bridge too far. 
That's right. 
I read World War II history, mother-. 
Well, nobody's going to care about his restaurant when there's a fashion show going on in the middle of it. 
And a big surprise from my husband. 
Eliza Beth. 
This is very, very easy for me to say to you, but you can't come in here right now. 
Wha... l just wanna 
drop off this little crinkly book that I got for Virginia. 
I can't let you in. 
After what happened betwixt you this morning? 
No, Virginia is not having you. 
What are you talking about? 
I might bite these fat little legs. 
They're so fat and juicy. 
Rude. 
Whit was a compliment. 
That's a thing people say to babies. 
You never talk about a black woman's leg size. 
Not on babies, not on the Williams sisters, not on a mannequin at Avenue. 
We have come too far. 
Now you know me, girl. 
I don't, really. 
I stay above these feuds. 
Did I get involved when Portia took the over-the-counter colon health test in the bathroom at Randi's domestic violence costume ball? 
I did, but I didn't want to. 
Can I be honest? 
I think I'm just anxious for Virginia to love me because I've been thinking about motherhood lately. 
I have a serious biend right now and... 
Lisa, D'Fwan doesn't talk about people behind their backs, so I'm just gonna tell you straight to your face that what you're saying right now is very boring. 
All I know is I'm gonna stay out of this fight between you and Virginia. 
That baby is a piece of work. 
You know she should be able to stack blocks in a tower by now, but she won't do it. 
I thought you didn't talk about people behind their backs. 
Hi. 
Go away. 
Rude. 
Down. Down. 
Boom, right there. 
God, these flower arrangements. 
You people are savages! 
Just excited. 
Wait, you're putting spoons in those. 
It's just knives and forks. 
Why am I even doing this? 
I still have to get the menus from the printer, go to the cony island beet market. 
I've gotta pick up Yakov Smirnov at the airport. 
That's enough foil, Gus. 
Jack, it's been a year that we prayed for this... restaurant opening, 
and I should just feel excited and relieved, but... 
It's complicated. 
When you open a restaurant with your mother in law. 
Hey, everyone knows you're not talking about the restaurant. 
You're talking about electricity. 
Thank you, Gus. 
There's the gang! 
Virginia. 
It's aunt Jenna. 
Look. 
I heard what Liz said about you, and I just have to say that I have known Liz a long, long, long time and she's totally shady. 
Oh, my God! 
You are hilarious. 
Do you act? 
Because we should do a movie together where we're on a road trip just being sluts. 
High five. 
No, I don't care that the others went to Pierre Batalini salon without me. 
It's not a feud, I just... 
I've never spent much time with babies, okay? 
And... what if I'm bad at it? 
This is good TV. 
I would watch this. 
I would feel for Liz. 
Isn't this usually a bathroom? 
No, Tray, it's usually Lutz's office. 
I see. 
I think I just solved the mystery of the phantom peeper. 
What's wrong, L.L.? 
You look like Angie when I tell her I wanna retire and live in an old lighthouse. 
It's just D'Fwan and everybody are saying that I'm in a fight with Virginia, which is idiotic, because she's a baby. 
Maybe it's just that children in general don't like you. 
Thank you, Tracy. 
I am dealing with something real here, but all anyone wants to do on these dumb shows is fight and scream and throw things. 
I wouldn't know. 
I really don't watch TV. 
I'm more of a masturbator. 
Well I'm about to get original on you, Tracy. 
There is no such thing as reality on reality television. 
You're happy now America? 
No. 
Yes. 
Welcome to Rus. 
This evening, we're serving all the Pierogis Costco had and then burger king. 
That's a sharp look, Kenneth. 
Thank you, sir, but I can't take all the credit. 
Everything I know about fashion, I learned from my old college roommate, John Mark Karr. 
Right this way. 
Oh, for God's sake. 
You've got a lot of nerve coming here. 
You know this is Virginia's night. 
You have no class, you prostitution whore. 
What are you talking about? 
I'm hitching my wagon to Virginia's star. 
Trying to get a little camera tiempo. 
Jenna, you've had cameras following you around all day. 
You're a star now. 
They want you on the show. 
They want me. 
Which means I'm too good for this crap. 
Like when I sang at that children's hospital. 
Get away from me, I'm revoking my waiver. 
Now blur my face. 
Blur it more. 
More. 
Now disguise my voice. 
Thank you, gays. 
Yes. 
Excuse me, do you know where the indoor outhouse is? 
Is my fashion show ruining Jack's party? 
Oh, don't worry. 
Nobody's even noticing it. 
There's so much other stuff going on. 
And it's not just Mr. Donaghy 
and this oriental matter. 
There's the feud between Ms. 
Lemon and baby Virginia, the drama between me and that cord I tripped on. 
Hey, watch it. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
I shouldn't have lost my temper. 
My damn husband better show up. 
Disaster. 
Deandra "I didn't know I was pregnant"-ed. 
Who's gonna wear this now? 
Ah, size 12, that's what I am. 
Oh, I was my grandmother's favorite so I got all her old hand-me-downs. 
crowd gasps] What a rush! 
You were horrible. 
That's the last dress. 
Tracy didn't even do anything. 
He didn't even show up. 
I'm gonna kill that man. 
What's cocaine like? 
 What was that? 
 Damn, you two. 
Avery's coming back from North Korea. 
Portia reads the papers. 
I hate that that's my catchphrase. 
What was that? 
That was nothing. 
I mean Jack's like that with everybody. 
He's a kisser. 
Right, Jack? 
Uh, of course. 
Uh, it's European. 
If you don't kiss someone, they're offended. 
Very good, nice seeing you, Lemon. 
Jack, D'Fwan hasn't said "hi" yet. 
Honey, what was that? 
Okay, Liz, I don't know what she's talking about. 
But Virginia said she knows what you just did for Jack. 
She misjudged you, and she would like a hug. 
The feud's over. 
It's all good. 
Now I'm just looking forward to this trip. 
Because Virginia loves her little giraffe so much, the show is sending us on a girls' getaway to Somalia! 
Whoop whoop! 
I hope you're at peace with your God, Tracy Jordan. 
Because you are about to meet your maker. 
Honey, you seem upset. 
I spent the last 20 years supporting you. 
I had three of your children. 
I gave you a kidney, a kneecap and a bladder. 
But I ask you to do one thing and you can't do it. 
All I wanted was a standing ovation and for people to tweet that I was the new icon for black womanhood and then for me to tweet "why just black womanhood?" 
Instead, I got nothing. 
I might as well be Daphne. 
Who? 
I'm Daphne. 
I handle conflict appropriately, and I'm up to date on my mortgage payments. 
Oh, no, I turned what was supposed to be a boring romantic evening into a gigantic fight in front of all these cameras. 
Yes. 
How inconsiderate of you to cause all this drama and start this riveting fight. 
Our celebrity marriage is on a breakup collapse. 
We're a train wreck you cannot look away from! 
I can't stand the sight of you. 
My love tank is empty! 
Yah! 
Lizard egg! 
I want a divorce or whatever. 
It will be contentious and last all through next season. 
Both: I'm cheating on you! 
Virginia: Rude! 
Next week on Queen of Jordan... 
Hey. 
I was in the neighborhood. 
I thought I'd pop up and say hello. 
For God sakes, D'Fwan, I'm working. 
Fine. Come here. 
You again? 
I am so sorry. 
Different cord. 
You were two hours late, you stole all my hangers and, yeah, I'm drunk. 
I'm on vacation.

Jason, I really like your look. 
You had it poppin' tonight. 
I totally disagree. 
Because I love your look. 
You're a star. 
Believe in your dreams. 
 Thank you. 
 Jason, have you ever put out a cigar on Gilbert Gottfried's neck? 
Because I have, and his screams were the worst thing I'd ever heard. 
Until tonight. 
Congratulations, you're a disgrace. 
 Shoo-bee-doo-bee, shoo-bee-doo-bee-doobee   shoo-bee-doo-bee Ah! I rolled my ankle. God! 
Also, Jason, if you think you're passing for straight, you're embarrassing yourself. 
17 million people watched that show last night. 
Not me. I've got 
better things to do than watch Jenna humiliate children. 
So you don't care that Shayla made it to the next round? 
 How? She is so pitchy. 
 What can I tell you? 
The audience just loves Shayla's personal story. 
Did you know that both her mothers are serial killers? 
That's America. 
 Shoo-bee-doo-bee, shoo-bee-doo-bee-doobee  So, did you miss me over the break? 
Of course. A little less than 
my kidnapped wife, but I did get a nice Christmas card from Avery and Kim Jong-Un. 
At least I had some quality time with Liddy. 
She's like a little human tumbler of scotch. 
You turning soft on me, Donaghy? 
If you want, I can recommend a good gynecologist. 
You know, 'cause I really like my guy. 
He's sort of a doogie howser type. 
But younger. 
Aren't you going to ask me how my... 
No. I know exactly 
how your holidays were. 
You took the train to your parents' house. 
On Christmas Eve, you forgot that eggnog has alcohol in it, and got into a shoving match with your aunt about who puts the star on top of the tree. 
It was my year! 
What, lupus lets you just cut the line? 
You received two sweaters that you didn't really like and got your dad a book on world war ii that he already owned. 
Wow, you really think you know everything about me, don't you? 
Yes, after six years I really do. 
Well, I will have you know that there are aspects of my life about which you know nothing. 
Take off that jacket. 
If you're not wearing one of those Christmas sweaters out of guilt, I'll give you $1,000. 
Wrong, Jack. 
'Cause they weren't sweaters. 
They were Dickies! 
Happy 2012! 
Good morning, Mr. Rossitano. 
I'm sorry you're going to hell. 
That's okay. 
How was your break? 
Wonderful. 
Reverend Gary did the math, and guess what? 
The world is ending tomorrow! 
And you're happy about that? 
Oh, of course. 
I get to go to heaven and receive my reward! 
72 virgin margaritas, hold the salt. 
Oh, I'm sorry I won't be seeing you in heaven, Mr. Spurlock. 
But on the bright side, black hell does have a jukebox. 
So you think this is your last day on Earth. 
Well, I'll leave the thinking to other religions. 
Well, you must have things you want to do before you die. 
Is the sky blue? 
Until tomorrow, when it will be on fire. 
Then you should go and do them. 
I came across the following quote on the side of a tampon box this Christmas. 
"Work like you don't need the money. 
"Love like you've never been hurt. 
"Dance like nobody's watching. 
Enjoy these satchel Paige brand tampons." 
You know what miss Lemon? 
I will do that. 
Thank you. 
You're just giving him the day off? 
That's awfully nice. 
I'm a nice person. 
Because I'm a happy person. 
My happiness makes me nice. 
Also, maybe I'm in a good mood because I'm not being weighed down by redundant torso fabric. 
 What does that mean? 
 Wouldn't you like to know? 
Amazing news, Liz. 
I made the People magazine crossword. 
One across, five letters, "Jenna Maroney's first name". 
Wow! 
Congratulations. 
Because of America's kidz got singing, I am blowing up. 
When you Google "Jenna Maroney" now, I come up first. 
Not the Jenna Maroney who electrocuted all those horses. 
Jenna, that was you. 
Anyway, I'll be back for rehearsal after I tape the show. 
Talent walking! 
This has nothing to do with Jenna's success that I'm jealous of, but if that yellow-haired bag of teeth keeps me waiting for rehearsal, I will set my dressing room on fire. 
Okay, first of all, Tracy, you know you're the real star. 
Huh. You know what? 
I'm not doing this. 
 But I'm acting out. 
 Right. 
And I know it'll all blow over eventually, and so I'm just going to skip the exhausting middle part. 
But you're supposed to control me. 
You're Liz Lemon. 
That's what you do! 
You're a 42-year-old man. 
No, I'm not. 
I took a real age test. 
It said I'm dead. 
Hey, I was just going to call you. 
You wanna watch today's Kidz taping? 
We're kicking off "Public domain week". 
This week, America's kids sing really old songs that everyone knows and NBC doesn't have to pay for. 
 It's brilliant. 
 Wow, more money. 
This thing's a real cash cow. 
Unlike cash cow, the failed NBC spin-off of cash cab. 
You try riding a cow through midtown Manhattan, Lemon. 
The animal will panic. 
Right. Anyway, I was 
just going to call you because I'm wondering why I received an email confirming my membership in a dating service called desperationships.com. 
Because after 6 years, I know you're depressed after spending the holidays alone. 
I'm not depressed, Jack. 
And I don't need some dumb dating website. 
What if I told you your first match burned his groin off in an accident at his cake shop. 
 No. Not interested. 
 Five minutes. 
Show's getting started. 
I'd better get in there. 
I'll see you soon. 
Five minutes to tape, everyone. 
Die, you blonde bitch! 
Thank you. 
 Turkey in the straw, Turkey in the hay   Turkey in the straw, Turkey in the hay   roll 'em up and... 
Is that your daughter? 
She's adorable. 
Thanks. 
She's my angel. 
Her name's Liddy. 
Oh. Ha. That's odd, 
because my daughter's name... 
I'm going to interrupt you right there, Liddy. 
Terrible song selection. 
You were sharp. 
And I'm about to get raw with you. 
You're weird looking, Liddy. 
Even if you could sing, with that face it would be like eating a steak that just came out of a dumpster. 
 I've done that. 
 Here's my advice, Liddy. 
Go work on your presentation. 
Take voice lessons. 
Then seal yourself in a barrel, and fall off of the waterfall. 
You leave Liddy alone! 
I need it quiet to record my catchphrase. 
Sebastian, I'm going to give you a few options. 
 Love it, Jenna! Go. 
 Is this your show? 
Liddy, go jump back up your mother. 
Liddy, go jump back up your mother. 
Go jump back up your mother, Liddy. 
Yeah, I like the third one for me, and her crying on the second one. 
I love it. 
Brilliant, Jenna. 
Hello, Mr. Hornberger. 
Kenneth, what are you doing? 
Sir, this chiquita banana sticker had been stuck to that ceiling for years. 
So I finally scraped it off. 
No, listen. You can do 
whatever you want today. 
I know! 
Isn't it great? 
I'm finally doing my dream chores. 
Give me that. 
"Scrape sticker off ceiling, "fix that humming noise only I can hear, organize snack table by food jewishness..." 
Kenneth, this stuff isn't even your job. 
That's why they're dream chores. 
Look, if it was my last day on Earth I wouldn't be here, I'd be with Paula, admitting I'm in love with her twin sister. 
Kenneth, we were just out on the Plaza, and four flaming horses rode by. 
Reverend Gary says super-gay horses are one of the signs of the apocalypse. 
Exactly! 
The end is nigh. 
You should raise your hopes up even higher than they are now. 
I will. 
I did! 
We have a problem, Liz Lemon. 
I just remembered, I started a camp for underprivileged kids last summer. 
We have to drive upstate to see if any of them are still alive. 
That sounds like a Tracy problem, Tracy. 
Okay, how about this? 
I'm changing my name. 
From now on everyone has to address me as "the gentleman formerly known as rectum." 
Pay attention to me, L.L, 
or else I'm going to do something self-destructive. 
For example: I just got an honorary sheriff's badge, and I'm going to start making real arrests. 
 Great. 
 I just realized, I haven't paid taxes in 30 years. 
Oh, we're not doing the pre-tape tonight because I'm leaving at 6:00. 
What's going on with you? 
Why are you acting so weird? 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
You're not doing your job. 
You're laughing at rectum jokes, you're leaving early. 
Did we switch brains? 
Why am I not feeling your boobs? 
Baah! 
What is happening!? 
Jenna. 
We need to talk about Kidz. 
Did you see last night's ratings? 
The only show I've ever been on that got a 10.2 
was when Mickey Rourke threw me onto the field during the super bowl. 
Obviously I'm thrilled about the show's success, but I wanted to talk to you about your...onscreen persona. 
I had an idea... 
Two words: B.B. Gun. 
Actually, I think the mean thing may have run its course. 
What if you went the other way, and you were nice to the kids? 
Well, no. 
I mean, being the nice one is McEnroe’s thing. 
Ah, yes, well, we've done some focus testing, and frankly I haven't seen such a unanimously negative response since the Frasier spin-off, hey, Roz. 
Jenna, they hate you. 
No, Jack. 
They love to hate me. 
Kidz is minting money for both of us. 
And what's more important than money? 
Well, perhaps we could make even more money by pretending to be nice. 
I mean, look at Betty White. 
End of discussion. 
Just ease off on the kids. 
Look, according to Tracy, people are switching minds around here. 
That's obviously what's happened. 
So whoever you are, show me Jack's penis. 
That's for you. 
Damn, I've got to get more of these. 
I don't know what this is, but I like it. 
Ha, finally. 
After 6 years, I've cheered up miss Lemon. 
That was on your list? 
I'm not always in a bad mood. 
And I happen to be in a really good place right now. 
Well, enjoy it while you can, because tomorrow, you're going to women's hell. 
Uh, also, FYI, women's hell is the same as aroused dog heaven. 
Kenneth. 
Why are you still here? 
This is your last day on Earth. 
There's so much you haven't done. 
Oh, sir, I've done plenty. 
Oh, really? 
Have you ever been in love? 
Only while playing tennis. 
I'm kidding. 
I've never played tennis. 
Have you ever been in an airplane? 
Well, does falling off a bridge in a horse cart count? 
Have you ever stood on a beach and watched the sun rise? 
Sir, I've never even seen the ocean. 
Never? 
Kenneth, that's insane. 
We were all put on this crazy blue marble for a reason... 
 To love, and live. 
 What is going on with you? 
Everyone's talking about how weird you're acting. 
 What are you on? 
 You know what? 
I have seen the ocean on a can of tuna. 
Newsflash, Kenneth! 
Everybody get down! 
It's not going to happen. 
The world's not ending. 
Oh, the rapture is happening, sir. 
Mr. Rossitano 
said he saw the snakes making peace with the mice. 
You're like a child. 
He's messing with you. 
And you know what? 
In the words of my father, "you deserve to be disappointed. 
Merry Christmas." 
Can I talk to you, Jennifer? 
Tracy, how do nice people dress? 
Socks on their hands, no belt, roller skates. 
Do you think Liz Lemon has been acting weird lately? 
She's hiding something from us. 
Like what? 
A present? For me? 
Can I return it for cash? 
No, this is bigger than that. 
Something like a sex-change operation or a secret pregnancy or a radioactive spider bite. 
I've got to get her focus back on me, or who knows the dumb stuff I'm going to start doing? 
Is that why you're not wearing pants right now? 
Yes! I'm actually 
glad this happened. 
You're proving my point. 
Look, if you think something's going on with Liz, just follow her. 
Steal her mail, go through her trash. 
That's what Paul and I do to maintain intimacy when he's having his period. 
Thanks J-Mo. 
Great advice. 
 LA LA LA LA LA LA LA, Oh, LA LA LA LA LA  Oh  yes, I know the muffin man   he lives on  drury lane Breathtaking. 
You're the wind beneath my wings. 
 Brock... 
 I...like what you did. 
That was good singing. 
You don't have a little rat face, you opposite of a turd with eyes. 
Why are you messing with perfection, Jack? 
You need to remember that reality television is formulaic before you get us canceled. 
Because I will not go back to putting hair extensions on dogs. 
Easy, d'Fwan. 
Yeah, we have a problem, but we're going to get through it, 'cause we're family. 
It's not working. 
You're ruining the show. 
You think I don't know that it's not working, Jenna. 
Next week Jay-Z was going to do a duet with one of the spinning chairs from the Voice, and the chair just pulled out. 
You're off the leash, Jenna. 
Did you see what happened here? 
We turned an argument into an opportunity to become better friends. 
All: Aw. 
I'll see you in heaven, Mr. Jordan. 
Ken, I only have room in my brain for one problem, so I'm not really absorbing what you're saying. 
I have to go through Liz Lemon's trash before she gets in. 
You're at work before miss Lemon? 
Now, that's a sign of the apocalypse. 
Time to die. 
You know what Emma? 
That was pretty good. 
You were trying to get me to commit suicide, right? 
Liddy, thank you for coming in. 
I know you have to read your books with sleepy bear in half an hour, so I'll make this brief. 
You're almost one now, and you have to understand the way the world works. 
Now, I don't know if you've seen America's kidz got singing, but it's a hit. 
Variety called it "Boffo," and they don't throw that word around lightly. 
However, there are large portions of the show that feature Jenna insulting children not much older than yourself. 
I know what you're thinking... 
"Do you really care about the bottom line "more than the feelings of helpless innocents? 
That's cruel." 
Well, guess what Liddy. 
Life is cruel. 
Sometimes in business, there's collateral damage. 
And if you think I'm going to turn my back on a 10.2/4.2 in the demo 
just because I feel bad... 
Just because those kids had the same scared look on their faces that you had when that dog got too close to your stroller in the park. 
And yes, being a parent is like wearing your heart outside your body. 
And I don't want you to know that the world is really a scary, disappointing place. 
You shouldn't have to know that, not yet. 
Oh, God. 
I have to cancel the show. 
What are you doing, Liddy? 
Are you touching my hand because...you're a baby 
and you're developing your fine motor skills? 
Or are you trying to tell me something? 
What are you trying to tell me? 
Mommy. 
Did you say "money"? 
Is that your first word... money? 
Mommy. 
 Yes, money. 
Are you telling me that money's more important than doing what's right? 
That I should keep on doing the show? 
I want mommy. 
I want money too! 
Oh, thank you, Liddy. 
Thank you for convincing me to do the right thing. 
Aw. 
Hey, think how disappointed I am. 
I mean, I'm the... 
I'm the one who had to nude-baptize all those teens. 
Hey, buddy. 
Are you here to make fun of me, sir? 
Well go ahead, make fun of the super-handsome guy who believed too much. 
I don't want to make fun of you. 
I know you're disappointed. 
I just wish I had a magic wand  to make it all... gah! 
 Ah, Kenneth, it's all real. 
The beast is here. 
Aah! Redire ad abyssum! 
Princeps tenebrarum! 
Ow! It's me, Lutz. 
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
Stop. 
Toofer. Frank. 
Get out here. 
You three are in a time-out. 
Everybody in the van! 
Liz Lemon is a crack whore. 
Probably not, but continue. 
It's the only explanation. 
She's on a ho stroll to pay for her drug habit. 
I followed her last night, J.D. 
She went down to Penn Station. 
And not the fun stationery store up on the Upper East Side. 
The skeezy one with trains. 
Well, there has to be some other explanation. 
Are you sure it was Liz Lemon and not present day Sally Field? 
I know it's crazy. 
But ever since we got back from Kwanzaa... 
She's been acting all weird. 
All relaxed and not angry. 
Well, it has been two days, and she hasn't once stormed in here carping about how all the destructive hurricanes get female names. 
But it can't be drugs. 
Then how come I found this in her trash? 
Oh, Tracy, this is dexoprex. 
My mother takes it for joint pain. 
Her wrist was starting to bother her from slapping busboys. 
So it's not the Bandito Blanco? 
A name for cocaine I just made up? 
I know Liz Lemon better than she knows herself. 
Why would she need joint pain medication? 
And why would she be meeting people down by... 
Tracy. 
What building is right next to Penn Station? 
The Manhattan center for penis enlargement? 
I know because my friend goes there. 
His name is Tracy. 
Madison Square Garden. 
Did you know that Lemon attended college on a partial jazz dance scholarship? 
And do you know what event was held last night at Madison Square Garden? 
A crack whore convention? 
No. Worse. 
 Every person dance soon  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the WNBA's most popular dance team, "the Timeless Torches." 
 Dancing Torches dance soon  Oh, God! 
So much grapevining! 
It's so beautiful. 
A mermaid! 
Dude, those are diapers. 
So that's why you've been so happy and distracted lately. 
The joy of movement, exercise, 10% off arena snacks with your torch card. 
And who figured the whole thing out? 
The man who knows me better than I know myself. 
Pull over here, please. 
This is me. 
Ah, going to the movies. 
Let me guess: You're going alone, to the 9:10 showing of Garry Marshall's New Year's Eve. 
You've waited five weeks to see it, to make sure that you wouldn't contribute to it being the number one movie in America. 
You'll say you're seeing it ironically, and yet you'll tear up when Ashton Kutcher  kisses Lea Michele. 
 You know me. 
I love it when the swarthy girl gets the guy. 
 The Camptown ladies  sing this song  doo-dah  doo-dah  the Camptown racetrack's  five miles long  oh, doo dah day  gonna run all night  gonna run all day  I bet my money  on a bobtail nag  somebody bet on the bay   somebody, somebody  somebody bet on the bay A disgusting disappointment. 
My name is Bob. 
I'm 61 years old. 
My favorite move is the shoulder shake. 
My name is Joyce. 
I'm 63 years young. 
My favorite move is the Dougie. 
I'm Liz. I'm 39, 
for the third time, and my favorite move is sunset arms. 
Hi, I'm Lewis. 
I'm a grandfather from the Dominican Republic, and my favorite move is the lift. 
Sorry, Lewis. 
Nice try, Liz. 
Dance like nobody's watchin'!

﻿1 Tracy, Jenna. 
We all know what happened when you hosted the St. Patrick's day parade 
three years ago. 
Wake up, mother-. 
And when you hosted two years ago. 
Die, demon! 
Why didn't you ever call me back? 
Unfortunately, unless Harry's law really took off this week and no one told me, you two are the biggest stars at the network. 
But this year, everything you say will be scripted and on prompter. 
Do not deviate from the script. 
Jack, Tracy and I are total pros. 
On television, and when it comes to the assisted suicide debate. 
Secret handshake, my baloney. 
Hazel, I won't be here tomorrow, so... I wanted 
to give you this. 
It's the tail I had until I was 16. 
Well, don't worry about the parade. 
I'll take care of Tracy and Jenna like they're my own children. 
Which is a bad example, because I left my kids at a sears in 2004. 
Oh, I told you about Mr. Jordan's allergies, right? 
Yes, Kenneth. 
He's only allergic to allergy medication. 
But he loves it. 
And Ms. Mulroney's... 
Kenneth, let go. 
This is my rodeo now. 
Well, not literally, of course. 
The U.S. Rodeo Association 
does not lift lifetime bans. 
So are you gonna work through St. Patrick's day? 
Don't you want to celebrate Ireland's great accomplishments, like Michael Lohan and vomiting into a bagpipe? 
Wow, Lemon, so I take it you will not be wearing green tomorrow. 
I will be wearing head-to-toe orange, in honor of protestant William of Orange, inventor of the Orange, according to Yahoo answers. 
You in Orange? 
You'll look like a creamsicle with an old tooth stuck in it. 
Well, you'll never see me, 'cause I don't leave my house on St. Patrick's day. 
Criss and I are going to ride out hurricane shamrock holed up in my apartment, laughing at excerpts from Angela's ashes. 
You know, some people might find your attitude offensive. 
Oh, what are they going to do about it, write a meandering play about how amazing the Irish are at not overcoming adversity? 
Well, I'm sorry we can't all belong to ethnic groups as beloved as the Germans. 
Please, without Germans, you wouldn't have any of the Indiana Jonesmovies. 
Lemon, your secret love of the Irish is well-documented. 
After all, I am your mentor, you dated Dennis Duffy, and in the '90s, you gave money to the IRA. 
I thought it was contributing to a retirement account. 
You know, I think someone needs to learn a St. Patrick's day lesson. 
What is that? 
A curse? 
Take it back, you witch! 
30 ROCK S06 Ep 12 - St. Patrick's Day 
On Radio: This American life, Saturday, March 17th, St. Patrick's day. 
You know, everybody complains about the weather, but today on the program, we meet somebody who actually... 
Hey, what are you doing? 
Get out of my studio! 
Happy St. Patrick's day! 
Let go of me! 
Didn't you hear my show on bullying? 
Hey, Criss, watch this. 
Megan! 
Megan! 
Look at them spin around. 
They're so confused. 
 Awesome. 
 It's too many Megans, right? 
I love you. 
Uh huh. 
I just ordered thai food. 
How much do you love me now? 
Man, they're fast. 
You know what, I can't wait till the asians take over. 
Thank God for delivery, keeping us inside and safe from all the Irish nonsense. 
Hey, dummy. 
The curse. 
What's up? 
I'm Dennis,  a former lover of Liz's. 
 Oh. 
I tried to steal beer from a Duane reade, and some black guy cold-cocked me. 
Ooh, like a security guard? 
I don't know, pal. 
I don't see people that way. 
No, no. 
No. 
Hey, before we go on,  do you want to pray together? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, Michael Jackson's ghost... 
 Oh, Great Kabbalah monster... 
NBC is showing the promo I worked on for the parade! 
I'm famous. 
And now back to NBC's live coverage of the 2012 St. Patrick's day parade, 
with hosts Jenna Maroney and Tracy Jordan. 
Oh, my God! 
They said my name first. 
But I'm more famous than you. 
Oh, this is probably some Hollywood prank, like on the set ocean's 12, when I put that snake in George Clooney's bed. 
I was not in the movie. 
Or maybe now that Kidz is a giant hit, I'm the one America wants to see. 
You better not be talking about my dear friend, America Ferrera. 
Get your stuff out of here, 'cause I get the bigger dressing room now. 
I'll replace your lizard with a gay guy in a giant champagne bottle. 
Siri, kill Jenna! 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on? 
I get second billing to this small-boobied grandma? 
No, you guys are friends, remember? "My baloney"? 
The only baloney Tracy has is the baloney he's full of. 
Why would you say that? 
You can't take that back. 
Siri: I killed Jenna elfman. 
Is that right? 
Did you show them the promo? 
Hazel, we don't let them watch NBC. 
Jenna thinks that Christina Aguilera lost her voice during childbirth, and Tracy doesn't need to know that he just became number two around here. 
That kind of mistake can ruin everything. 
I don't like the way you're talking to me. 
Why don't we drive to Sears? 
I'll buy you a toy. 
Excuse me. 
May I help you? 
What? We don't use your 
bathroom when you're not here. 
I'm Lutz. 
Frank, first of all, what are you doing here on a Saturday? 
None of the writers can go out on St. Patrick's day 
because we all have faces people naturally just want to punch. 
So we're all hiding out here, playing Colonizers of Malaar. 
It's a strategy board game from the makers Goblet quest and virginity keep. 
In Malaar, you build a kingdom and battle for world domination. 
Right now, I'm just the Lord of the Karthian plains, but that means I control all the wheat! 
Huh. 
It's actually interesting. 
You have a monopoly on wheat. 
But what happens if you overproduce, flood the markets? 
Prices drop, your economy collapses. 
You've got to diversify, Frank. 
It's basic capitalism. 
What other resources do you have? 
Uh, unicorns? 
Can you breed and sell them? 
There's got to be a market for unicorns. 
If I've learned anything from reading Liddy's princess books, unicorn hair has magical properties. 
You've got to know your product, Frank. 
That's awesome. 
Ah, it's nothing. 
That kind of thinking is what I do for a living. 
At least, I used to. 
You just have to replace "Malaar" with "Fairfield, Connecticut," and "unicorn" with... 
"Project: Unicorn," a death Ray. 
Hot dog truck, huh? 
I went entrepreneur, too. 
I got this new business where I burn your old DVDs onto laserdisc. 
Whoa, Dennis, I don't think you should be drinking with a head injury. 
That's a good Liz impression, Criss. 
She's a bummer. 
Well, 911 is still busy. 
What could be causing so many medical emergencies today? 
Oh, right, an Irish religious festival. 
Irish pride! 
Go, Celtics! 
Celtics suck. 
Go, Knicks! 
As soon as I get through, I'm getting you an ambulance, and you are out of here, Dennis. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
I can't get into an ambulance. 
I don't have health insurance because of Obama. 
Look, Liz, I don't think he needs to go to the hospital for a concussion. 
I was a volunteer EMT. 
At burning man, and we agreed never to talk about that. 
At sunset, the CACTI start to resemble people looking for hugs. 
It gets ugly, Liz. 
You know, there's some things I miss about being with you, like having somewhere to hook my SEGA up to, but this constant judgment... 
Criss deserves better. 
Criss, may I speak to you alone for a minute? 
No. Anything you need 
to say to him, you can say in front of me. 
Me and Criss... 
 We're bang brothers. 
 Ugh. 
God, live TV's such a rush. 
It's like sex, but your husband isn't looking at a picture of a bridge. 
Peter, can you explain this to me? 
Well, obviously I'm host number one. 
We all saw the promo. 
Hazel, the script had Tracy and Jenna's names in it. 
Did you change that? 
Duh! 
After you PMS-ed about their names yesterday, I thought numbers would make everyone happy. 
We're on in five, four, three... 
Both: Welcome to the 2012 St. Patrick's day parade on NBC. 
They're both reading host number one. 
Would a third host help? 
I am S.A.G. eligible, 
but I will only do nude stuff if there's a mirror behind me. 
Forget the parade, Hazel! 
For six years, we've been tricking them into thinking they're friends, and you've undone all that in a day. 
Both: I understand you have some interesting trivia about this year's parade. 
No way, that's amazing! 
No. 
I've moved on. 
Both: I couldn't agree more. 
I'm playing two timber and one brick to build a bridge and establish a trading post in Midgar. 
That failed... 
And the Orcs raped everybody. 
Okay, and I am offering Frank 500 gold coins for the neutral land between the Elf kingdoms. 
 I'll double it. 
 The price is now 3000. 
 I'll mortgage Theowyn castle. 
 I'll take out a loan. 
Don't you see what you're doing? 
You're creating a real estate bubble, and the only person who'll benefit is sue, who'll buy up all the neutral land for cents on the dollar. 
Thanks a lot, Klootzak. 
I don't come to where you work and slap the... 
It's basic macroeconomics, people. 
None of you is fit to be king of Malaar. 
And you would presume to wield the scepter of Thalbain? 
Yes. 
Yes, I would. 
Why are you being nice to him? 
What, you want me to be jealous? 
I'm not that guy. 
I'm this guy. 
No, you need to know something. 
Dennis Duffy is like the Terminator with cheaper sunglasses. 
He just keeps coming back, because his potato brain thinks he still has a chance with me. 
Hey, Liz, you'll be back. 
If I ever see you again, I'll kill you. 
You'll be back. 
 Never again! 
 You'll be back, Liz Lemon. 
You'll be back. 
I'm not kicking Dennis out of here in his condition. 
Guy with a concussion on St. Patrick's day 
is like a horse with a broken leg. 
Exactly. 
We should shoot him. 
Don't you see what he's doing? 
He's already driving a wedge between us. 
Criss, get in here. 
There's a lez movie on showtime. 
Um... 
Ugh, three again? 
And your yak... 
Has smallpox. 
Rockefeller, no! 
What? 
Dennis is here. 
Take back your curse. 
This isn't funny anymore. 
Oh, really? 
You're cursed? 
Try ruling over the desert wastelands of Kroth with no spell cards. 
Are you playing Colonizers of Lamar with the writers? 
Malaar, and this game is just dumb luck. 
I dug all these trenches to irrigate the desert... 
But no one's playing his rain ca... 
I'm trapped in a barren wasteland, and no matter what I do, I can't get out. 
Wait. 
Oh, my God, it's happening again. 
The desert of Kroth is Kabletown. 
I've got to get some fresh air. 
So fine, two can play at this game. 
I'm putting an old German curse on you. 
 Hey, Dennis had a great idea. 
 No. 
I should take the hot dog truck out after the parade, and sell empty buns to drunk people. 
Oh, my God, Criss, he's just trying to get me alone so he can start a gas leak or claim squatter's rights or hit me over the head, and when I wake up, we're on our honeymoon. 
At seaworld. 
Are you sure this is Dennis's obsession? 
'Cause you're the one who can't seem to stop talking about him. 
Are you kidding? 
I know Dennis Duffy's brain. 
I saw some of it when he jumped on the ice during an islanders game. 
His next move will be mentioning some fake girlfriend to try to make me jealous... 
But I'm going to turn it against him. 
And once again, the puppet will become the puppet master. 
What does that mean, "once again"? 
That's not a thing. 
This ends right now. 
Dude, you missed the end of the lez movie. 
Their daughter, she goes off to college, and Mark Ruffalo, he's just gonna do his own thing with the restaurant. 
Look, is there anyone you want us to call to let them know you're okay? 
I left a message for Megan earlier, but it's hard for her to answer her phone, 'cause her boobs are so big. 
I'm sorry, and who's Megan? 
She's my lady, Liz. 
I'm seeing someone. 
She's a card girl at kangaroo boxing matches, so she's got a body, and she's loaded. 
Her grandfather invented the stop sign. 
Wait, are you saying you're over me? 
Elizabeth, don't do this. 
Because I am not over you. 
I never will be! 
I love you, Dennis. 
I love you so much... 
Whoa, what the hell, Liz? 
No, Criss, I'm just proving my point. 
I don't care what you're doing. 
So it turns out you can't say "I love you,"  just not to me. 
 Wait, what? 
It's not like you haven't had the chance to say it. 
 Love you. 
 You're the best. 
 Love you. 
 Scoobydoo. 
 I love you. 
 I just ordered thai food. 
And I thought you were just emotionally infantile. 
I am! 
Me baby. 
Yeah. 
I'm gonna take the truck out. 
Oh, no, it's happening. 
The wedge! 
Liz, we need to talk. 
Open the bag of wine. 
And we're back with our live coverage of the St. Patrick's day 
parade. 
I'm Al Roker, taking over for Jenna Maroney and Tracy Jordan. 
He should have said my name first. 
Roker should be on my side. 
Why, because you both have had huge weight fluctuations? 
What? 
Okay, that's not how you're supposed to answer the phone. 
Just thought I'd check in. 
Everything's fine. 
Pete says I'm doing great. 
I'm not about to screw this up, Kenneth, 'cause I'd get kicked out of show business, and then how would I be famous? 
By starting a fire and then rescuing everyone from it? 
And then I'm a hero and then I'm Playboy? 
Hazel, are Mr. Jordan 
and Ms. Maroney fighting? 
Well, you're not a page anymore, Kenneth. 
That information is classified. 
You look troubled, son. 
Would you like to talk about it? 
I'm stuck, father. 
Stuck in a company that won't innovate or change. 
I feel helpless. 
Impotent. 
Whoa, buy me a drink first. 
Sorry, we've been instructed to keep it light. 
Ah. 
Now there's a man who overcame some difficulties. 
I'm sure you know the story of St. Patrick, 
driving the snakes out of Ireland. 
I'm going to have to stop you right there, father, 'cause I know for a fact that there were never any snakes in Ireland, and St. Patrick didn't drive 
anything out of anywhere. 
Knock, knock. 
First of all, he was born in fourth century Ireland. 
He might as well have been born in a grave. 
His only worldly possession was no snakes. 
But he turned that... 
Huh... into sainthood, 
a holiday, this magnificent cathedral. 
He was just some guy starving in the wilderness... 
Exactly like me. 
But he found a way to change his luck, to take nothing and turn it into... 
By the scepter of Thalbain. 
Out! 
Now! 
Look, Liz, there's something I've got to tell you. 
 Not interested. 
 Megan isn't my girlfriend. 
I know, and I am not letting you... 
She's my wife. 
We just got back from Seaworld yesterday, and I know this is hard for you to hear... 
Oh, yeah, it's so hard for me to hear about your "wife." 
I'm so jealous. 
Dennis, baby! 
I would have got here sooner, but I passed out laughing on 69th Street. 
That's hilarious, Megs. 
What's up, sugar? 
 Hi, how are you? 
 How are you doing? 
Wait a minute, Megan is real? 
I thought you were lying to get us back together. 
That's why I said I loved you. 
I was trying to call your bluff. 
Wow, you know, that's really messed up, Liz. 
Okay, wait, you said you love him? 
Okay. 
You got two minutes to fill a sock with quarters, and then we go outside. 
Oh, my God, stop it, no more of this Irish nonsense. 
Dennis, you came in here, possibly as part of a curse, and ruined everything! 
What? I did nothing. 
Hey, if anyone's full of Irish nonsense, it's you. 
 Excuse me? 
 Think about it. 
You're the one that got all emotional and made a fool of herself at a party. 
This wasn't a party. 
Tell me about it. 
It sucked. 
Look, you're stubborn, you hold grudges, you're emotionally repressed. 
She's been living with this great guy, and hasn't said "I love you" yet. 
Really? 
Not even on a Ferris wheel? 
 Ugh. 
 Let's face it, Liz. 
You're the most Irish person here. 
Happy St. Patrick's day, 
dummy. 
Wait, it's St. Patrick's day? 
St. Patrick's day, baby. 
The first car is here for whichever one of you wants to leave first. 
Why do I keep doing this stuff? 
Is 70 not a good IQ? 
Well, the bigger star gets the first car. 
But the sign says it's for host number two. 
I'm scared, J-mohr. 
And not just 'cause today's the day that guy that tried to kill me gets out of jail. 
I'm scared 'cause... 
What if I'm not the biggest star anymore? 
Tracy, I know how you feel. 
I've felt that way for the past five years. 
And now that I've gotten everything I wanted, all I can think about is how quickly it can all go away. 
Tell me about it. 
A year ago, I won an Oscar. 
Now look at me. 
I had to beg to take over for Andy Rooney. 
And it did not go well. 
When I was a kid, you could get a prostitute for $5. 
You know what? 
I'll read host number two. 
No. 
We'll read it together. 
Aww. 
Know this, Hazel. 
I will always be here... 
For them and for you. 
Nothing can ever make me... 
Move your car. 
I'd like to spend my remaining gold... 
To purchase a fire spell. 
And against whom will you be casting this spell? 
Against myself. 
I am setting fire to my own desert. 
 You're insane! 
 Am I? 
I'm going to turn my desert into glass, and glass is a commodity that you all need, for your elfin oracle mirrors, for your crystal palace, for the colorful glass beads that you keep buying for some reason. 
I'm going to wear them to the pirates' ball. 
You need my glass. 
And I'll take your gold... 
And eventually, the throne of 1,000 kings. 
You see, it doesn't matter if I'm on the wind-blown dunes of Kroth or in the fluorescent-lit boardrooms of 30 Rockefeller Plaza. 
I will create something from nothing. 
Today Malaar... 
Tomorrow Kabletown. 
Your highness, you may take your right as king. 
I am a virgin... 
with white guys. 
All right, mustard only. 
There you go. 
Enjoy your bun. 
Sorry, sorry. 
These are the only green things I own. 
More importantly, I have never been with someone for longer than nine months. 
You and I have been together for six, so I assume something will go wrong soon. 
You'll tell me you believe in ghosts, or I'll reveal that I am terrible at expressing my feelings. 
But it's not because I don't have them. 
It's just because... 
I'm used to being let down. 
Wait, is now the time on St. Patrick's day when 
we talk about our feelings? 
I don't understand your art, Kevin. 
But this isn't fair to you, Criss. 
This is the happiest I've been in a long time, and I'm sorry that I can't just be a normal person and tell you stuff. 
Like, nice stuff. 
Like... 
Greeting card stuff. 
Oh, you're right there, buddy. 
Come on, homestretch. 
Come on. 
Okay. 
I love you. 
I know. 
You solo-ed me. 
Both: Thanks, host number one. 
Let's take a look at what's happening live in Rockefeller Plaza. 
I love you. 
Oh, I got this! 
That is a person named Liz Lemon who just told some dude she loves him. 
Well, I have known her for a long time and she never said that before. 
Is sure as rewarding as a TV viewer when someone you're interested in shows growth. 
Also, TV viewers liked when in a show is a song. 
Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling From glen to glen, and down the mountain side Don't you dare fade out on me. 
﻿1 Well, hello, Hank. 
So good of you to come up. 
Well, I'm not gonna miss the America's Kidz got singing finale. 
Last time I was this excited was this morning. 
I saw a cat wearing the same sweater as its person. 
Jack, you remember my granddaughter. 
Oh, hi, Mr. Donaghy. 
Kaylie. 
There's Jenna Marone. 
So, Jack, how's your wife? 
Still kidnapped? 
How's the yearbook going? 
I heard you made editor... 
Of the photo captions. 
Hey, Pop-Pop, wait up. 
Hey, Pop-Pop, wait up. 
I'm so excited for the finale. 
Not that it matters, even if Brock doesn't win, he is going to get a record contract. 
So, it definitely doesn't matter. 
This isn't the last we will be seeing of Brock. 
Well, whoever wins, it's a great night for the industry. 
Kidz is a hit the whole family can watch together, not your usual sitcom crap full of gratuitous vulgarity and pratfalls. 
Wah! Oh! 
Oh, my penis! 
Jenna, this is a big night. 
And I've got something big planned. 
Tonight during the finalists' duet, I'm gonna cry. 
Now, of course, none of these little condom accidents could actually make me cry, so I'm gonna rub this under my eyes to help me fake it. 
It's an old acting trick I learned from Glenn Beck's prostitute. 
Well, mark my words, Jenna, tonight is going to be the greatest. 
Disaster in the history of television. 
The young contestants apparently inebriated on live TV. 
 Oh, Shushanna... 
I gotta throw up. 
What happened? 
Why haven't you been returning my calls? 
Because my phone melted last night, Lemon. 
Come here, Jack. 
Mm... 
That was my angriest hug, 'cause that's how I feel right now. 
Instead of heading back to Philadelphia, I'm going down to deal with the FCC. 
The Federal Clown Commission. 
I hope that comes off as respectful. 
My father was a clown, and I know how hard those men work. 
I'm going to get to the bottom of what happened last night, sir. 
I've already detained Brock and Ava under the patriot act. 
People have forgotten about that thing, but any white male can arrest any other person. 
Hello, peers. 
Sure has been a busy morning down in the Standards department. 
Because of last night's cluster-whoops, Darren was fired. 
Then he threatened to come back with a gun. 
Then I got a promotion, and the desk closest to the door. 
Here are my new business cards. 
Late night programming? 
So you're covering TGS now? 
And a wonderful new show from D.L. Hughley 
that's already been canceled! 
I feel like Oscar the grouch today, and not just 'cause I woke up in a garbage can this morning, startling someone named Gordon. 
What's wrong, Tracy? 
I can't eat for 24 hours 'cause I have a colonoscopy tomorrow. 
I'm starving! 
You know, fasting can actually clear your mind. 
In college, I once went on a hunger strike  to protest apartheid... 
 Oh. 
You're the one who solved that? 
Thank you so much. 
1997 Heather Locklear, what are you doing here? 
What? Jenna! 
Save it, Liz. 
Yes, I was disappointed that I didn't get to do my fake cry, but I do have a plan B. 
The whole point of the cry was to humanize me, to change public perception, but what else humanizes a monster? 
Motherhood. 
Oh, God. Don't adopt. 
That child is better off in Somalia. 
It could be a pirate, or a warlord's concubine. 
This is better than adopting. 
Remember my little moneymaking scheme back in Chicago? 
Cashing your dead aunt's social security checks? 
Oh, no, I'm still doing that. 
I'm talking about when I donated my eggs. 
So, a couple of months ago, I called the calumet city egg donation center and house of blues to see if there were any little Jennas out there who wanted to meet me. 
Hang on, are you saying you have a kid? 
No, I don't. 
Oh. 
I have six kids. 
Jerome, share the bronzer, you slut. 
Dear God. 
30 ROCK S06 Ep 11 - Standards and Practices I'm a very powerful man, Brock. 
Little league tryouts are coming soon. 
How would you like to wind up on a team with... 
None of your friends? 
It was her idea! 
She made me do it! 
Brock just sold you out, Ava. 
What are you doing to Molly? 
She already had to live through world war ii. 
Brock said it was all your idea. 
No, it was her idea. 
She's just so cool. 
Like a human silly band! 
Who? 
Who's a human silly band? 
I'm tall enough now that there isn't a roller coaster in the world I can't go on. 
 Wow. 
 So... 
You guys drink beer. 
Or are you babies? 
Jack versus Kaylie, round two, colon... 
No subtitle necessary. 
Mommy announcement. 
I hope we're all waxed, because you're coming with me to my interview tonight for Barbara Walters' 10 most overexposed people. 
Oh! Barbara Walters! 
Okay, so, let me just quickly identify everyone's good sides. 
Left, left, right, right, left... 
Oh, Judy. That's not really 
on message. 
Look, I didn't call the donation center to be on TV, Jenna. 
I wanted to go get a cup of coffee and get to know you. 
If you want to get to know me, read my 2006 interview in AmTrak magazine. 
If you want to be my daughter, put on this wig and smile. 
Oh, there you are, liierz. 
Boy, I am still not comfortable calling you by your first name. 
Then again, you've never been comfortable calling me by my full Christian name. 
Kenneth. 
Oh, no, "Kenneth" is short for andromakennethamblesorton. 
 So, what's up? 
 Oh. 
Wait, what is this? 
"Additional restrictions to broadcast standards"? 
Yes. 
People are pretty upset about last night. 
How can we do "Fart doctor" without the word "fart"? 
I'm surprised they allow you to say "doctor." 
It's so close to "gynecologist" which is disgusting. 
Have you seen this memo from Standards? 
Kenneth is being a real... 
dingbat, which is now the harshest word we are allowed to say. 
Oh, you can blame that on Kaylie Hooper. 
She's the one who ruined the Kidz finale. 
Really? What a... dingbat. 
Why didn't I see this coming? 
I knew this company was making me lose my edge. 
That's why I hired a Cato to attack me at random. 
Like inspector clouseau. 
Cato? 
Don't attack me tonight, okay? 
I know I told you that when I say, "don't attack me," that's when I most need you to attack me, but I'm serious. 
Cato? 
Aah! 
Excellent, Cato, excellent! 
Did Kaylie really think I wouldn't figure this out? 
No, she knew I would. 
So, she's going to be ready for me. 
Good. 
I like a fair fight. 
Okay, she is just a teenage girl. 
Lemon, you know very well that a Nemesis can be anyone... 
Or anything. 
Autocorrect. 
I was trying to say "pen organizer." 
Oh, God! 
You're a winter! 
I don't know what that means. 
Why are there only six chairs out there? There's seven of us. 
Oh, no. One of us will 
have to sit out the interview. 
I'm just gonna choose at random who it's gonna be. 
Eenie-meenie-miney-moe, out goes ♪ y-o-u  I'm sorry, Judy. 
 Bye, Judy. 
All:  Could've just gotten another chair. 
Who is it? 
Sweetie, it's Pop-Pop. 
I came back from D.C. early, 
and I lost my darn key. 
What a world. 
Surprise. 
I'm very good at voices, Kaylie. 
I'm very good. 
I know what you did. 
And you had to assume I'd break Brock and Ava, so, you're ready for this, but here's what you weren't counting on... 
This has nothing to do with you! 
I just had to get Pop-Pop out of town because I am in so much trouble! 
Henry and his friends had to go to the King of Prussia mall last Thursday night 'cause it was a half day, and I couldn't go 'cause I had piano, and my friend Vickie, well, she said she got grounded 'cause she went to some highlighter party with Dylan while his parents were out of town. 
Whoa, okay, hang on. 
Calm down. 
And then fat Vickie saw her there, so I called her, and Henry answered her phone because he had Vickie's phone! 
Wait, which Vickie? 
Fat Vickie? 
Vickie P. 
Are you even listening to me? 
 Okay. 
 God! 
Vickie used to be my best friend. 
I had her youface password, so I logged onto her account, and posted all these photos with "I am a slut" written on her forehead, and then school found out, so now my life is over! 
Please! 
What does this have to do with sabotaging me? 
This has nothing to do with you! 
I messed up the show to make sure Pop-Pop wouldn't come back to Philadelphia with me, 'cause Dr. Melvoin is trying 
to kick me out of school, and if Pop-Pop comes to the teacher conference, well, then, he'll let them expel me, and I'll have to go to some school in the middle of nowhere, and then I might as well be dead! 
Wait, where are your parents? 
Who knows? 
My mom is in Indonesia visiting her charity where poor children make shoes. 
Isn't that just a sweat shop? 
I know! 
And then my dad put a Porsche engine in a model T and drove it to Mardi Gras! 
I know what it's like not to have your parents around. 
I once took a log with googly eyes to a father-son picnic. 
But, uh, who's going to take you to this parent-teacher conference? 
I don't know. 
I have nobody! 
I wanna die! 
Do you have a second, Kenneth? 
No, there's only one of me. 
What? What are you asking? 
Look, we have a show tonight. 
You can't just take away all these words we've been using for the past six years. 
Oh, that reminds me. 
You can't say "using" on TV. 
It implies drug use. 
We're saying whatever we want. 
No, you can't. 
That's an order. 
I stole that speech from an episode JAG, but it applies here. 
Are you kidding me? 
Last week you were a page, now you're telling me how to run my show? 
Well, I am arguing back at you. 
I have enough crap to deal with around here, Kenneth... 
I'm interrupting you 'cause I'm good at arguing! 
I don't need you to make my life worse. 
I am responding, I am matching your tone, and making my own point. 
You know what, Kenneth? 
Fine. You win. 
But as we saw the other night on Kidz, anything can happen on live TV. 
 Right, Tracy? 
 What? 
I'm just saying, Tray, you're very unpredictable. 
And we'll write clean sketches, but you might just do your stand-up act. 
 Who knows? 
 Okay. 
I'm still fasting because I misread my calendar. 
Tomorrow is my colonoscopy. 
Today was my meeting with Colin o'Scopy. 
Therefore, I have no idea what you're saying, talking Turkey leg. 
Were you a difficult teenager? 
Well, I was voted head of the PTA, so no. 
I'm accustomed to dealing with difficult people, Lemon, but teenage girls, ugh... 
Are a puzzle. 
Oh, yes, how was your meeting with your Nemesis? 
I volunteered to accompany Kaylie to a parent-teacher conference at her school. 
 What? Why? 
 It's complicated. 
The point is, and I never thought I'd say this, I actually feel badly for Kaylie. 
On the other hand, I know full well that this is an opportunity to destroy her. 
I could get her expelled, sent off to some second-rate boarding school, then on to that last bastion of the incompetent rich, USC. 
I don't know, Jack, you should stay out of this. 
No, I could help this girl. 
Or destroy this monster. 
If I could just tell whether she's vicious or vulnerable. 
That's the problem. 
She's a teenage girl. 
She's vicious and vulnerable. 
She might be completely lying, like when I was 15 and told everyone at my school that I'd already gotten my period, or she could be in real trouble, like when I was 17, and finally got my period at a very loosely supervised petting zoo. 
Once again, Lemon, I leave your office more confused than when I entered, but having glimpsed yet another tile in the rich mosaic that is your menstrual history. 
So bravo wants to do a reality show about us, and I thought the opening credits could be all of us in a giant dog bed, and you guys are suckling on prosthetic dog teats that I'm wearing. 
Actually, we had a different idea. 
Now that Judy's gone, it's kind of obvious someone is the odd person out. 
It's Jerome, right? 
I didn't want to say anything 'cause I was trying to be a good mother, but you're cheesy, and everyone hates you. 
No, Jenna, you. 
You're so much older than the rest of us, so we're thinking the show is more like The girls next door, and you're that old boat captain that shows up sometimes. 
That's Hugh Hefner, Jessica. 
Yeah, we have no idea who that is, so you're kind of just proving our point. 
I see. 
Very well. 
Looking for this? 
Well played. 
Oh... 
Dude, what's up? 
I'm just having a bad day, sir. 
All right, bro-bro, let's just be cool, and sit down and pee in silence, like dudes do. 
It's just... 
I started a new job, and it's stressful enough just having my own wastebasket that I have to fill every day without Liz Lemon yelling at me, and I just wish I had never been born! 
'Cause if I can't even get my friend Liz... 
At least I thought she was my friend... 
To respect me, how will I ever run a network and boss around those Jewish executives that were trained from birth to argue? 
So, I should just give Liz what she wants, and quit. 
Bro... 
You should just smack that Liz in the mouth. 
Sorry I babbled so much. 
Thanks for listening. 
I'm Kenneth, by the way. 
Me too. I'm Kenneth. 
Kenneth... uh... 
Toilethole. 
I'm so sorry Dr. Melvoin. 
You know, I already apologized to Vickie, and to fat Vickie. 
Fat Vickie's parents were very upset that she was dragged into this mess. 
I know. 
I know what I did was stupid, and I've really learned my lesson. 
Look, if I could go back in time, I'd just... 
I'd skip clarinet, and I'd go to the spring football with my friends, and none of this ever would've happened. 
Or you simply could have not posted those pictures. 
On hot Vickie's youface page, miss Hooper. 
Uh, hold on, Melvoin. 
You told me it was the piano, and that everyone went to the King of Prussia mall. 
Well... 
I don't remember. 
And I'm just so emotional right now. 
Ha! 
I'm sorry, how are you related to miss Hooper? 
I'm her Nemesis. 
You bastard. 
Don't do this, Donaghy. 
I think that this school has done everything it can for Kaylie, but the only fitting punishment... 
Is expulsion. 
It's days like this that remind me why I got into teaching in the first place. 
Kenneth, we need to talk. 
I don't know, 'cause someone who actually cares about my feelings told me to smack you in the mouth. 
No, don't listen to Kenneth Toilethole. 
 You know him? 
 Yeah. He's great. 
We should all go get dinner sometime. 
Kenneth, you can do this job, and I do respect you. 
Then wash my feet with your hair. 
No! But I did completely 
rewrite the show. 
We're not even using the word "dingbat," Mr. Parcell. 
A Parcell man has never been called "mister" outside of an execution chamber. 
Oh, boy. 
The blonde ones, they turned on me. 
They threw me away like I was some kind of Judy. 
Oh, God. 
Is this how Judy felt? 
Judy was nice and sweet and wanted to get a coffee enema or something, and I treated her like garbage. 
Well, then why don't you apologize to her? 
She's right behind you. 
Oh. 
Judy, you're so beautiful now! 
Oh. 
I just came to say good-bye before I head home. 
I wish we had spent more time together, but I guess I'll see you on TV. 
No. 
Of all my children, you're the only one that proves there's any good in me. 
Forget TV. 
Let's go get that coffee now. 
No. You know 
you can't do that. 
One minute to air. 
One minute. 
I have to stop Jenna from leaving. You just... 
No problem. 
I'll cover. 
Day two of my fast, and you were right. 
My mind is clear, and I'm sharp as a tack. 
Great, Tray, thanks. 
My brain is working overtime. 
I finally understand the ending of The sixth sense. 
Those names are the people who worked on the movie. 
Oh, yeah, and I just got what you were trying to tell me yesterday. 
You want me to do my filthy stand-up act instead of reading the cue cards. 
No. 
Jack! Help! 
I was right about Kaylie, and I crushed her. 
That's great. 
I need... 
The whole time, she was playing me, but in the end, she made the biggest mistake. 
She could not have been worse in that meeting than if she had wanted me to... 
Son of a dingbat! 
Tracy's gonna do his stand-up act on the show! 
What are we gonna do? 
I'm gonna live bleep him. 
Normally, I'd have to get permission from Irene first, but there isn't time. 
You know why I love Dominican women? 
'Cause they love to  those big   'Cause they eat all our  aloud. 
I'd like to introduce  housed in a  , booooy! 
You just ate a  with extra ? 
Well, you called the right . 
That's our show for tonight! 
See you next week! 
 That was amazing! 
 It sure was. 
Kenneth, I'm Gaylord Felcher. 
The head of Standards? 
I have never seen bleeping like that, so guess what? 
I'm  promoting you, you little -face. 
All right, Felcher, you don't have to talk like that. 
Well, who's gonna stop me? 
Who among you has the power to censor the censor? 
What a surprise. 
Whatever are you doing here, Kaylie Hooper? 
Enjoying my total lack of adult supervision. 
I just had fruit roll-ups for dinner... 
At a strip club. 
Do you wanted to get expelled from school, didn't you? 
Look who figured it out. 
It only took you, oh, I don't know, a million hours. 
You didn't lie to me about getting sent to school in the "Middle of nowhere." 
What I realized too late is, you were talking about Beekman Academy, right here in Manhattan, in the neighborhood North of ware street, otherwise known as, uh, "noware." 
Now I'll be able to be close to my boyfriend Henry. 
Like hot Vickie could ever steal him from me. 
He's going to NYU. 
To study acting. 
If Pop-Pop had gone to that meeting, he would have just written a check and made it all go away. 
You needed somebody to throw you under the bus. 
You needed a patsy. 
I, uh, couldn't help but notice that lacrosse ball in your backpack. 
Too bad I'm on the board of the Central Park conservancy, so beekman won't have a field to play on next year. 
Well, good, 'cause I planted that lacrosse ball there to get back at a girl I hate who plays lacrosse. 
Her name is Jack... ie. 
Jackie... officecouch. 
Damn you, Donaghy! 
Cato? Seriously, 
not tonight. 
I mean it this time. 
 Aah! 
  Son of a dingbat! 
Sorry. 
That phone call took forever. 
Where's Kenneth Toilethole? 
You just missed him. 
Again. 
He had to go to the bathroom. 
You know what? 
I'll go get him. 
No, don't! 
Every time one of you leaves, the other one comes back. 
You know, I'm starting to suspect that I have bad luck. 
Dude, bro, where's Liz? 
You didn't see her? 
She just left. 
Oh, I gotta go feed the meter. 
Ohh! 
﻿1 I'm sorry, I bet your tongue it's been a while. 
I'm sorry I taste like Korean cigarettes. 
Tobacco's the only thing with protein over there. 
Their meat is just def lated kickballs. 
How are you feeling? 
Ready to put this all behind me. 
I don't even want to think about the things they made me do. 
Earlier today, America's credit rating was downgraded to triple fart-minus. 
You poor thing, over there all alone. 
Ahoy there. 
Oh, Jack, this is Scott Scottsman. 
Scott Scottsman. 
My ears are all plugged up from the plane. 
Am I talking too loud? 
Scott was forced to do sports on American news Channel USA. 
Avery Jessup with news. 
Scott Scottsman with sports. 
And it's me, Johnny Mountain, with the weather on the one and the traffic on the one. 
You no ask how I do it. 
It's a funny story, really. 
I was working for KSCT, our of Scottsdale. 
They sent me to South Korea to do a "where are they now?" 
On the pitcher Byung-Hyun Kim. 
Turns out he's still living in America, and I get kidnapped. 
Uhhuh. 
I had no idea there was another hostage there. 
A man. 
Right. Well, 
we should get home. 
For American news Channel USA, this is Avery Jessup. 
And I'm Scott Scottsman... 
Both: Reminding all of you there is no weekend. 
  30 ROCK S06 Ep 21 - The Return of Avery Jessup  Good morning. 
 Oh, you're up early. 
I'm putting together a knock list for the work upstairs. 
What do you think about an intercom? 
That way, if it's an office, you can call down. 
If it's a nursery, then you can hear the baby. 
Or the plant. 
It's your body. 
Right. Well, if I did 
ever have a... plant with you 
or whatever... 
I mean, at my age, we might have to get an Asian plant or accept an older plant with some behavioral issues, and we're a little afraid of it... 
Do you want an intercom, Liz? 
Yes. Sure. 
To hear the plant. 
I'm sorry. It's just 
the more we talk about this, it's scary. 
I mean, that plant's not coming out of your butt, pal, it's coming out of mine. 
All right, well, look, to do everything,  it's gonna be around ten grand. 
 Duck? 
I'm gonna do as much work as possible, but I don't think it's safe for me to do the wiring in an old building like this. 
The walls are filled with electrocuted mice. 
Well, I could dip into my 401K... 
Is something I've heard old people say in commercials. 
Well, I could chip in. 
If you take my prof its from the hot dog truck and add 'em to the $300 my aunt gave me for Christmas, I'd have $200. 
 Yeah. 
 Right. 
Let me think about it, but I've got to get to work. 
Oh, boy, I sound just like my dad. 
Which, I guess, makes me Mrs. Lemon. 
Seriously, though, I gotta get to work. 
Oh, I gotta get to yoga and lunch with the girls. 
Tracy, who sponsored your wedding? 
I don't know. There was 
a lot of fanta there, and the police, so maybe they co-sponsored it? 
Oh, that's right, you were a nobody when you got married. 
Only huge stars get to have their wedding sponsored. 
Ms. Maroney, 
a wedding is a simple and beautiful ceremony where an old man and a crying girl get pushed into the coupling shed. 
No, if you don't have a sponsor these days, you're nobody. 
My sponsor is  the Southern Tourism Bureau. 
It's perfect 'cause I'm sort of a down-home, America's sweetheart type. 
Leonardi, my hair psychic, is always saying how down to Earth I am. 
Oh, I know the Southern tourism bureau. 
They pay me a yearly stipend to stay in New York. 
They're paying for me and Paul to get married on an old plantation. 
Which is great 'cause our wedding was gonna be slavery-themed anyway. 
All I have to do is shoot a commercial and say, "Dixie is calling, you all. 
I reckon you should answer." 
Are you sure you're saying that right? 
Of course I . I have 
a natural Southern accent, 'cause I'm from le flori-dah pahn-hahndle. 
You know, a lot of people lose their accents once they leave home and go off to the big city. 
Before moving here, I done used to talk-n-jaw like this, see? 
And when I'm at work, I use my white-people voice. 
You should see how we talk in the Bronx. 
Raar blarg shmoo-boo wagga! 
I'm sorry, sir, I have no idea what you're saying. 
I'm sure it's nothing that I can't fix with a little accent work. 
I'm not gonna let it ruin my dream wedding. 
It's only a dream wedding? 
Thank God! 
I did not want to attend. 
All set, Jack. 
 Did Liddy go down? 
 Eventually. 
Understandably, she's a little wary of me. 
I heard her ask her bear who the dye job is. 
Oh, don't worry about it. 
You're home now, we're Jack and Avery, and we are going to crush this return to normalcy. 
Absolutely. 
It's gonna be like I was never away. 
Absolutely. 
Frankly, not too much has changed. 
There is an iPod 3 and a Mitt Romney 4. 
They worked all the bugs out. 
He's not killing hobos at night any more. 
And tomorrow, I am going to throw you a Thanks-Christmas-Valen-Easter-Ween of July party. 
Genius. We'll celebrate all the 
holidays I missed in one night. 
We are gonna be so normal so fast! 
I've already started my job search. 
I'm making a new reel. 
I actually did some good work over there. 
Scott and I co-reported on the North Koreans sweeping the Olympics. 
 They did, right? 
 Yes... Scott. 
I'm so glad there was someone there for you during this, uh, ordeal. 
Look, Jack, I know we can put everything back the way it was. 
There's just one thing I need to say first. 
I didn't wear your nightgowns. 
If they seem stretched out, it's because you're remembering wrong. 
No, Jack, what I want to say is... 
If anything happened while I was gone between you and someone else... 
It doesn't matter now. 
Okay? 
All is forgiven. 
Okay, Jenna, I need some relationship advice. 
Well, you've come to the right place. 
I've been writing a sex column for Cosmo. 
Cosmo is my 14-year-old neighbor. 
He doesn't know anything. 
No, it's not about sex. 
It's about money. 
Oh, Liz! 
Sex, money, power, fire, choking, being dragged behind a speed boat... 
It's all the same thing. 
Look, you and I are both in situations where we're the breadwinner. 
How do you and Paul deal with that? 
We love it. 
Gender role-reversal is such a turn-on. 
Paul keeps the house nice, and I try to get him pregnant. 
And the best part is, if I want to treat myself to a new pair of Christy LaButtons, I don't have to ask any man for $17. 
 I'm sorry, Christy who? 
 LaButtons. 
They're knockoff Christian Louboutins. 
I got tired of ruining $1,200 shoes trying to impregnate my boyfriend. 
You know something, against all odds, you have a point. 
Feminism promised us two things... 
Fatter dolls, and an end to traditional gender roles. 
Why am I fighting this? 
So what if I make more money than Criss? 
Exactly. 
It doesn't bother me. 
Doesn't bother Oprah. 
It sure doesn't seem to bother Criss. 
He's at yoga right now. 
You wear the pants, Liz. 
You don't necessarily pull them off because of your hips, but you wear them. 
So embrace it! 
Lemon, Avery's missed the past 12 months of popular culture. 
Could you put together a presentation for tomorrow? 
An hour, tops. 
An hour for the year? 
Am I supposed to just scratch the surface of channing Tatum's meteoric rise? 
Lemon, Avery did something strange this morning. 
 They brainwashed her, didn't they? 
Avery said something this morning... 
Something shocking. 
That no matter what happened while she was gone, "all is forgiven." 
And that's bad? 
It seems awfully nice of her, considering. 
Exactly. Awfully nice. 
Does that sound like Avery to you? 
 Well, no. 
 That woman does not forgive. 
She's still furious with Al Gore for stealing George Bush's idea to have an Internet. 
And now she's forgiving me? 
Why? 
Because she wants to change the conversation because she's done something she doesn't want to talk about. 
And what do people not want to talk about? 
Soccer, jazz, infidelity. 
Okay, first of all, I don't know what you count as cheating, but she was forced to marry someone else. 
Kim Jong-Un, Lemon. 
Have you seen news footage of that man? 
I have so many missile! 
I even have nuclear missile. 
Just for you, sugarprong. 
There was another American there, Lemon. 
A man. It raises 
some red flags. 
Oh, my God. 
Who are you to talk? 
You French-Canadian kissed her mother, which is my name for French kissing when it bums everybody else out. 
Yes. Brilliant. 
I'll use my indiscretion to guilt her into revealing hers. 
The game is afoot! 
No. She's been back 
for, like six hours. 
Maybe take a little time, let things get back to normal. 
Playing psycho-sexual mind games is our normal, Lemon. 
This is perfect. 
Everything's perfect. 
Dadgum possum up and what been bit my mother's neck brace. 
Dadgum possum up and what been bit my mother's neck brace. 
 Again! 
 Dadgum possum up and what been my mom's neck brace. 
Again, you waste of my time! 
Dadgum possum up'n what bit my mama's neck brace! 
There it is. 
Again! 
Excellent. 
Again! 
Dixie's callin', y'all. 
I reckon you should answer. 
No, this isn't right. 
This isn't Southern elegance. 
This is a dirtbag girl I once knew. 
A girl named Jay-nuh! 
She used to get into fistfights at water parks, and lost her virginity to a bait salesman on a water bed. 
She's not who I am any more. 
I'm classy. 
People who say that about themselves usually are. 
This whole Southern thing is wrong. 
I need to find a new wedding sponsor that's as classy as I am. 
I'm not this person, 'cause I done got rid of her! 
Kim Jong-Il could not be reached for comment because he was having a totally normal day being alive and not dead. 
And now with sports, Scott Scottsman. 
Thanks, Avery. 
In NBA action, Kim Jong-Un won the championship today. 
Our brilliant comrade scored 200 points and then went hot-tubbing with a couple guys he's definitely just friends with. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
Look, I've been thinking about what you said earlier about forgiveness... 
It was beautiful. 
But I would feel very guilty if I kept anything from you, as I know you would if you kept something from me. 
So while you were away, I did have feelings for another woman. 
Thank you. 
I forgive you. 
You lose, Jack... 
Is what Kim Jong-Il said to Jack Nicklaus after def eating him in golf today because they're both totally alive. 
Wow, you went out and bought a Fedora. 
Oh, this? I finally watched 
the premiere of Prime suspect on Hulu. 
It's really very good. 
Anyway, I thought I would treat myself. 
But don't worry, I'm gonna take care of you too. 
Wow. Okay, but look, 
I still want to chip in on this renovation. 
And clean out your life savings? 
Why don't you take that $200 and buy yourself something cute? 
Here's a hint. 
 I like zippers. 
I'm a man. 
I'm a man, I'm a man! 
I'm an adult man! 
You think I like you having to pay for everything? 
It's humiliating. 
But gender roles, fat dolls... 
You think I like having to earn crisspoints so that I can take you on dates that you actually pay for? 
I thought you liked the crisspoints system. 
Only because liking the crisspoints system is one of the ways I earn crisspoints! 
Okay, I'm sorry that I offended your male pride, but you're the one who chose to sell hot dogs out of a car. 
It is a van with a car engine, Liz, okay? 
Now, look, if your show gets canceled, okay, or NBC just becomes a web site that sells used office supplies, I'd like to know that I can take care of you. 
And now we're talking about having a plant? 
It's stressing me out! 
Oh, really? 
It's stressing you out? 
Of course, because you're the person who has to krang that plant for nine months, poop it, and then go back to work to support both of you! 
Uhhuh. 
So what you're saying is you need somebody different to do this with. 
Somebody with money that's probably named Spencer or Grant. 
And he has a watch, and an office with a trash can and a little basketball hoop on it. 
And he plays as hard as he works because, damn it, he deserves to blow off a little steam. 
God, I don't wanna be with Spencer! 
And yet you're silent about Grant. 
Well, guess what... 
I'm gonna become Grant. 
That's right, tomorrow I'm gonna take my truck out, and I'm gonna start pulling my weight, like a man. 
Now, get in that bed, and let's watch Dance moms. 
Hey, girl. 
Are you crying because there are no roles for actresses in their 40s, nor should there be? 
I thought I found a classy new sponsor for my wedding, but then something happened. 
to Southern accent] Hubbard's flavorless english water biscuits... 
I'm sorry. 
Hubbard's flavorless english water biscuits... 
 Cut! 
 They fired me. 
We did 50 takes, and I couldn't do it. 
50? That's nothing. 
I once did 100 takes and still couldn't say the word "incorrigible." 
Great, now I get it! 
Siri, bring Jessica Tandy back to life. 
I thought that girl from toilet swamp cove was dead and buried, but she's always been there inside me, and now she's taking over. 
I want to throw a natty light at a cop car! 
I have someone inside me too. 
It's a bath toy of a scuba diver. 
I need to take a walk and clear my head Tracy... 
Jessica Tandy's zombie is coming to find you. 
Is that correct? 
Yes, siri. 
Thank you, baby. 
So, Lemon, I took your advice and used my transgression with Diana, as a weapon to interrogate Avery, just as you suggested. 
That is not what I suggested. 
You just hear what you want to hear. 
Oh, thank you. 
They're from Italy. 
I just gave Avery a little taste. 
Said I was attracted to another woman. 
Guess what she told me. 
Nothing. 
She just forgave me. 
Believe me, I didn't expect her to come out of her forgiveness bunker so easily, but I really need to up the ante. 
Drop a grenade in that bunker, like Jim Brown in The Dirty Dozen. 
Enjoy your party, Nazis! 
Are you talking about your wife? 
God, she's good. 
This kind of gamesmanship is why I love her. 
She has the brain of a man, and the ass of a French teenager. 
But I will win. 
I don't know, Jack, it's 2012. 
It's not always clear who wears the pants in the family. 
I do, Lemon. 
I wear the pants. 
 Good morning. 
 Oh, good morning. 
Nice pants, Avery. 
And, Liz, good to see you. 
Oh, you're hair's the same. 
It's not. Actually, 
something terrible happened. 
I don't have a lot of time. 
I have my year-in-finance presentation after this, and Lloyd Blankfein slithers back into the sewers to eat rotten fish at 6:00, so... 
Deathly hallows and tebow   Oprah does her last show   Beyonce had a baby, yo   it's a 12-month wrap-up, rap-rap-rap-up  You know what, I'll just read some US weeklies. 
 Thank you, Lemon. 
 But it's an hour long,  like you wanted. 
 Thank you. 
Fine. 
I'm gonna head down to Goldman early. 
Avery, I should tell you something. 
I wasn't completely honest when I was being completely honest earlier. 
Let me stop you right there. 
I forgave you so that we wouldn't have to discuss this. 
Let me stop you right there from stopping me right there. 
I know why you forgave me. 
But the woman I mentioned, we kissed. 
And I know I would hate it if you kept something like that from me, so... 
So... I forgive you. 
And no matter what you say, I am always going to forgive you. 
Always. 
Aha! What do you think? 
Pretty awesome, huh? 
It's a brand new location, Liz. 
I got a subway entrance right here, and I got a tour bus stop right there. 
Also, FOX News is right across the street, and word is Greta Van Susteren eats hot dogs like slimer. 
Yeah, who's usually here? 
Oh, right, those creepy, off-brand sesame street characters that harass tourists into paying them to take pictures with them. 
I hate those guys. 
As a sesame street purist, I don't think Elmo usually tells passing women  the they have a sweet dumper. 
 Move it ! 
 This is our corner, pal! 
 You don't own this corner. 
And I got a family to support, like a man. 
   Oh! 
 Don't hit my cheekbones! 
 Hey, stop it! 
Get off him, Elmo! 
Legally, I have to say I'm Elmarg! 
Oh, them puppets done picked the wrong day to cross my kin! 
It's on, panhandle style! 
Well, it's over. 
I'm never gonna get a wedding sponsor now. 
That dirtbag Jay-nuh won. 
I wanted my wedding to be an expression of who I am, and now it will be. 
I'm a panhandle hick, and my wedding will be just another panel on my mother's family history back tattoo. 
Oh, come on, it's not all that bad. 
Look at that caption. 
"Aging star Jenna Maroney, beats up Elmo with her..." 
So you own things. 
That's good. 
"Christian..." 
That's always a good word. 
Wait, did they say "Christian" about my shoes? 
"With her Christian Louboutins." 
They didn't know that my shoes were cheap knockoffs. 
They thought they were fancy, even though they're secretly crap. 
That's it. 
That's who I am! 
I'm that knockoff designer shoe. 
My outside is shiny and pretty, but my inside is filled with cardboard and horse glue. 
I've solved my identity crisis! 
More importantly, I know who can sponsor my wedding! 
No, I think it's a very cool costume, mayor Bloomberg. 
Tonight, I'm mayor Booo-mberg. 
Yes, I think you've mentioned that. 
Booo... booo... 
Scott. 
Happy birthdaversary, honey. 
Oh, Jack, this homecoming's been amazing. 
Nice to see you relaxing and enjoying yourself, and totally unprepared for a forgiveness attack. 
 What? 
 Avery... 
What? 
The woman I kissed is your mother. 
That is... shocking. 
But I told you all is forgiven, so... all is forgiven. 
What do I have to say to guilt the truth out of you? 
How about this? 
A few months ago, Liddy broke into the gun safe and shot up your gift-wrapping room. 
I did wear your nightgowns. 
Not to feel you near, they're just comfortable. 
I had an erotic dream about an adult Dora the explorer. 
I took her on a balcony in Madrid, above the Plaza Mayor. 
She had flowers in her hair. 
Now I've admitted everything. 
Game over, Avery. 
Tell me what you did. 
I'll tell you exactly what I did, Jack. 
 I won. 
 You what? 
I got you to tell me everything you did. 
And guess what... 
I didn't do anything. 
 But Scott Scottsman... 
 Until the flight home, the only words I'd ever said to Scott Scottsman were, "and now with sports, Scott Scottsman." 
I thought I was playing you, and you were playing me the whole time. 
And in 24 hours, I got you to tell me things it would have taken you years to admit. 
Now we can start over. 
The final piece of the puzzle is just me forgiving you for, um... 
Kissing my mother! 
We did it. 
Everything's normal. 
 USA! 
 It's classic us. 
Damn it, Jessup, I'd marry you all over again! 
That's what we're gonna do. 
We've gonna renew our vows. 
 We need a new blender anyway. 
 Oh, baby. 
Oh! 
Sorry I'm late. 
Criss got into a fight with an Elmo. 
And he hates it that I make more money than he does. 
And I don't know, maybe we're not supposed to have a plant together. 
 Love is complicated, right? 
 Wrong. 
 We kicked love's ass! 
 Yes! 
We're renewing our vows. 
No, no, renewing vows is a kiss of death. 
You should have let me finish my rap. 
There was a whole verse about it! 
 J-Lo and Marc Anthony   Donn and Vicki from O. C.  
 12-month wrap-up, rap-rap-rap-up  Lemon. 
It's the kiss of death, yo! 
I reject Chris Brown's comeback!

﻿1  Cleanup, cleanup   do your own housework, you little crackers   what? 
 My kindergarten teacher was a former black panther. 
Oh. 
Hey, I'm gonna fix that loose baseboard upstairs. 
Wow, look at you, all sweaty with your tool belt and your '90s haircut. 
You look like you're in a gay porno. 
Oh, yeah? 
You're one to talk, buddy. 
I'm Brent. 
I'm the new guy on the crew. 
I'm Rod. 
I'm the boss. 
And what I say goes. 
I've never been with a man before. 
Looks like I'm the boss now... Rod. 
 Oh! What are we doing? 
 I don't know. 
Whatever! Let's wrestle! 
It doesn't matter. 
Liz, what is "adoption stuff"? 
 Are you adopting a kid? 
 No. Don't worry. 
That's from a long time ago. 
It's not happening. 
You have a baby name book, and you circled Adolf? 
Actually, I borrowed that book from my mother, so be glad I'm not a boy. 
Okay, well, why'd you give up on it? 
I have to work late tonight. 
What am I gonna do with Joshua? 
I thought I could do this by myself. 
You know what? 
Murphy brown lied to us. 
She had Eldin. 
Can you hold that, please? 
You closed the door on her? 
The point, Criss, is I didn't want to be that woman. 
I didn't want to do it alone. 
But let's face it. 
Murphy Brown had the whole fyi gang in her corner... 
Jim Dial, Frank Fontana, Corky, even Miles, in his own way. 
Yeah, but you're not alone now, and if a kid is something that you still want, and you're in your 40s, then... 
We should... 
we should have a... 
we should have a serious conversation right now. 
Oh, my God, relax. 
This is my life, and I love it. 
I've got my job, and I've got you, and I keep getting my neighborallure magazine. 
If there's anything that needs fixing in my life, it's a certain loose baseboard. 
Okay, well, I'm gonna fix it. 
And do not send Brent up there. 
I won't. 
Dude, I'm back from the hardware store. 
this country's taken some hits lately. 
But when we get hit and are down, we don't stay down. 
We get up, and we hit back with our fists or our nunchakus. 
And then, when we're done hitting and we're tired, 'cause nunchaku-ing can wear a guy out, we sit down on a couch, an American couch... 
A Kouchtown couch. 
Damn. 
Lemon, do you know you are sitting on 5,000 new jobs? 
And not jobs that came from some government bailout. 
They came from a rich white guy. 
We have been creating and solving this country's pRoblems for 200 years. 
Where's our history month? 
It is a nice couch. 
Good lumbar support. 
Absorbent fabric for nap drool. 
That's just the prototype. 
As we speak, our fellow countrymen are rolling the new Kabletown couches off the assembly line, earning an honest day's pay so they can go to the store and buy milk for their families, which costs... 
I don't know, $90 a gallon? 
I'm meeting with the vendors tomorrow, Raymour and his conjoined twin, Flanigan. 
Ashley of Ashley furniture will be there, and he is a genitally androgynous pinhead. 
Hmm. 
It's a colorful industry with a lot of fun characters. 
Well, good luck fixing America. 
I hope success isn't far, far away. 
What aboutstar wars do you want to say, lemon? 
Let's just get to it. 
I did some spring cleaning this morning, and I found this baby princess Leia costume that I bought years ago, and I thought it might fit Liddy. 
Oh, thank you, lemon. 
It might be a bit small by Halloween. 
Halloween? 
A girl can wear this anywhere. 
School, church, alone on the playground, a child therapist's office. 
Also, I thought you might want this Nixon biography that my dad gave me for my birthday. 
It had just come out, so as a joke, my dad signed it as Nixon. 
Yes, a joke. 
Nixon's been dead almost 20 years, not in cryogenic hibernation, resting up for 2016. 
I'm getting rid of all my junk so Criss can redo the upstairs. 
Wow, you two are really nesting. 
Yeah, all that's missing is the joint answering machine message. 
I'm thinking Sonny and... 
Cher. 
Lemon, I know how this will be received, but before it's too late, let me set you up with someone. 
Oh, my God. 
Come on, Jack. 
My colleague is newly single. 
His name is Kevin. 
I'm gonna stop you at Kevin. 
Has anyone ever known a good person named Kevin? 
Kevin garnett helped me move once. 
I'm good, thanks. 
Kevin costner cooked me dinner after a bad breakup. 
Kevin Sorbo intRoduced me to his podiatrist. 
This is an outrage. 
I didn't get to work an hour late just to be the first one here. 
I'm sorry, tray. 
I don't know where Jenna is. 
I'm sorry I'm late. 
I was busy burning down the panda express that I had fallen in love with. 
Oh, my God, Jenna. 
Are you okay? 
I'm fine, Liz. 
I'm just having a celebrity breakdown. 
It's the new sex tape. 
Something I wish I'd known before I released my sex tape with the six flags guy. 
 So this is just for attention? 
 Exactly. 
Anyone who's anyone has had a breakdown. 
"Da-mi", "de-mi", Heather, Lindsay, Britney, Muammar... 
so sad. 
A life cut short. 
He gave the best diamonds. 
Okay, good. 
I thought maybe you were really losing it, because, you know, Paul's with someone else and... 
oh, no. 
This is for Paul. 
You see, when you have a breakdown, all your old lovers come out of the woodwork. 
Justin and K-fed, Bruce and Ashton, Samantha Ronson and Herbie the Lovebug. 
This is how I get Paul back. 
Wow, that is idiotic. 
But as long as it doesn't affect work... 
what's that, celestia? 
All right. 
I'll do it. 
Mr. Donaghy, hi. 
I'm Stewart der. 
I'm the chief engineer here at Kouchtown. 
Do you know the history of this building, Stewart? 
During world war ii, the Bazooka Joe corporation used a softer version of their gum to make armor-piercing bullets... Here. 
Years later, the government took it over. 
They turned it into a training facility for single mothers to teach illegal immigrants how to fill out unemployment forms. 
But then we took it back. 
Ah, good morning, fellow patriots. 
Keep voting republican. 
We've got your back. 
Now let me have a look at this marvel of American industry. 
Good God! 
This doesn't look like the prototype. 
Looks more like the prototype than most things in this world. 
How could this happen? 
The one in my office was perfect. 
Oh, we didn't make the prototype. 
We bought it at west elm. 
Besides you, whom do I fire for this? 
I don't know. You? 
I mean, you're the one who insisted on hiring American engineers. 
All they teach us now is how to build rollercoasters and survivor challenges. 
This is what we've been making for the past month? 
We have 10,000 of these? 
I wouldn't know. 
I'm not a math guy, really. 
This is only a setback. 
I just have to create a market for terrible couches. 
Besides, what did Theodore "Bazooka" Joe do when his eccentric millionaire father left him nothing but a tiny pink rock quarry? 
He baked those rocks and sold them to children. 
As gum. 
Tracy, I need your input. 
I cannot give it to you. 
I'm a married man. 
But more importantly, I find you very unattractive. 
No, I need your advice. 
I'm having a celebrity breakdown. 
I've been there, j-mo. 
What's the matter? 
Partying too hard with Christian slater? 
Furious about Nafta? 
Y2k panic? 
My heyday was the '90s. 
No, Tracy, I'm faking it to get Paul to come back and take care of me. 
Fake breakdown. 
Interesting. 
I thought next I'd go nuts on thetodayshow, really blow it out. 
Jenna! 
Did Hamlet start the play by stabbing people? 
No. 
He started by being boring and ruining my anniversary, 'cause Angie wanted to take advantage of "all the great theatre in New York". 
Okay, I get it. 
You have to build to the big breakdown, like in a c+c music factory song. 
My heyday was also the '90s. 
So what have you done so far? 
Well, I've acted crazy at work. 
And I think this blind item in the post is about me. 
"What teenage a-lister..." 
get serious! 
We have work to do. 
Hey, want to watch Mythbusters? 
Mm. Can we have sex after? 
'Cause those guys always put fuel in my tank. 
Who is cigarfan@nbcuni.Com? 
"Avail 4 javamanana per Jack. 
Deets 2 follow. Kev" 
who is kev? 
Oh, my God. 
He gave him my email? 
Who gave who your email? 
Okay, I know you're not gonna be threatened or jealous about this. 
'Cause I got it going on? 
Jack is trying to set me up with some d-bag he works with. 
"Sent from one of my four iPads"? 
This guy sounds amazing. 
Obviously, I'm not going. 
Let me just write him back in his language. 
"Broseph. 
Sor-sor on the haps..." 
no, you know what? 
You should go. 
What, are you kidding? 
No, if you don't go, you're not gonna be able to tell Jack how wrong he is. 
If you do go just have coffee with this guy, maybe Jack will shut up, and I'll finally get the acceptance that, you know, every 39-year-old man craves from his girlfriend's boss. 
I do like telling Jack when he's wrong. 
And maybe Kevin will insist on paying, and I can get a jazz cd and a ham sandwich. 
"Dudely, let's make coffee our bitch." 
When did we get so soft? 
You know what this country used to sit on? 
Logs. 
Girders. 
Poles. 
Being comfortable? 
That's not what America's all about. 
Kouchtown. 
Sit down or get out of the way. 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. 
Help, I can't move. 
Tell me, can you even look at the television? 
I can see the floor. 
I can see the veins behind my eyes. 
Oh! I can see pain! 
Come. 
My whole body is asleep. 
Oh! 
That's a bad couch, Jack. 
It is unfortunate. 
The design forces the sitter into what Israeli military interrogators call a stress position. 
Oh. 
It cuts off circulation to the legs while simultaneously spreading out the ribcage, making it difficult to breathe while the body begs for oxygenated blood. 
It comes in espresso, dandelion, putty, and, as you see here, lagoon. 
So you're gonna just try to sell discomfort? 
I don't have a choice. 
If I blow this, Hank hooper will never give me another shot. 
I'll spend the rest of my career behind this desk trying to lure alf back to television. 
Okay, Jack. 
Well, I'm gonna go meet your buddy Kevin now. 
Yes, he mentioned you were getting together. 
And you certainly are dressed to impress. 
You look like a substitute teacher who just got her one-year a.A. Chip. 
Well, I'm just doing this as a formality, Jack. 
Lemon, I know you don't trust me, but keep an open mind. 
I'll do my best, but I watched, like, thrMythbusters last night, so I'm pretty exhausted, if you know what I mean. 
Our next guest has had a troubling 24 hours that has the tabloids talking and her friends... Concerned. 
Let's take a look. 
Thank you. 
Dhanalakshmi, I'm happy for you, and I'm gonna let you finish, but I just gotta say, Gurubarath Kurrupuswami spelled one of the toughest words of all time! 
That's yesterday afternoon. 
Here you are earlier this morning being asked to leave dick Cavett's birthday party. 
That's unfortunate. 
Then a kleptomania relapse ending in orgasm and arrest. 
Wow, Jenna Maroney has gone crazy. 
She sure has, said the second guy. 
Jenna, I know a lot of people are asking, are you okay? 
Matthew, I'd really prefer to just talk about my upcoming project. 
Me running through that window. 
Aah! 
Right this way, folks. 
Mr. Donaghy will be with you 
in just a moment. 
I'm so sorry. 
Where I'm from, Uncle Sam's mouth is sewn up, and then he's set on fire, so I don't know how he talks. 
Greetings, gentlemen and female eunuchs of the furniture industry. 
I give you a new couch for a new era, designed and manufactured in... 
America. 
It's a simple couch. 
Oh, good God, my leg! 
I can hack it. 
Pain is in the mind. 
Oh, sweet heaven. 
It's like I'm full of lightning. 
Jack, it's Ethan Allen. 
Are you all right? 
What do you want to know? 
I'll tell you anything to make it stop. 
You want secrets? 
I'll give you secrets. 
This couch... 
Is a failure. 
I hate golf. 
One time in college, I smoked a clove cigarette. 
I keep buying candles as gifts and keeping them for myself. 
My natural hair color is bright red. 
Agh! 
Amateur hour. 
Ugh! 
Agh. 
Good luck finding someone stupid enough to buy those couches, Donaghy. 
Everybody loCate your buddy, and let's make our way to the subway. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
If I could buy your couches, I would. 
You know, that's exactly what you'll do. 
Okay. 
And will you accept dancing as money? 
Kenneth. 
Drag me to my office. 
Agh! 
I issued a statement on your behalf using Twitter. 
A media-savvy crackhead, I know. 
I said that you were being treated for exhaustion and that you wanted to thank your fans for all their support, and also, you saw Tracy Jordan do 11 pushups. 
I just hope this works. 
Well, some of your former loved ones are already here. 
David Blaine. 
I can see that you're on a skateboard, David. 
This is why we broke up, Jenna. 
I know we only spent one night together. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
That never happened. 
Sure it did. 
I ate a pizza slice off your back. 
At one point, your veneers fell off, and you had these little baby fangs. 
Thank you, Frank. 
It feels like only yesterday you were in my gym class, Jenna. 
Now, you weren't the only student I dated, but you were the only one who shot my wife. 
Jmo, these are from Mickey Rourke. 
No! Tracy, put them down! 
I don't know. 
Maybe 'cause I'm a season ticket holder? 
Hi, you must be kevi... 
no. No, let me fin... 
let me finish. 
 Are you... 
 He's my dad. 
It's "take your daughter to work" day, which I object to on feminist grounds. 
It's patronizing. 
Like girls don't know what jobs are. 
I'm Liz, by the way. 
I'm Catherine, but everyone calls me Cat. 
Although I'm trying to get people at school to call me scout, like in to kill a mockingbird. 
I love that book. 
I had my first crush on a shop teacher who looked just like Boo Radley. 
Yeah, scout's not getting much traction, though. 
Well, it's hard to force a nickname. 
I tried to get my high school tennis team to call me ace, but they wanted to call me shorts accident. 
So we settled on supervirgin. 
Okay, so I might not get scout, but I can negotiate up from puked in thermos. 
Well, then, let me ask you this. 
Would Jeremy lin be willing to videotape a message for my buddy's bachelor party? 
Ugh. 
Sorry. She's with me. 
It's "take your daughter to work" day, and Kabletown's really into all this family shiz. 
So what have you learned today? 
That people who talk the most in meetings often know the least. 
She sat in two meetings with me. 
I crushed it. 
So what's your deal? 
You ski? 
I don't. You know, if I'm 
gonna fall down a hill and die, I want to do it for free. 
Brian. What is up, slick? 
Do you think I could pull off a haircut like scout had in the movie? 
I've been there, Cat, and you should know that people are gonna assume that you're... 
I'm a lesbian? 
I know. 
I just needed to hear it. 
So, what do you want to be when you grow up? 
Either the wicked queen inDisney on ice or the third woman president. 
Well played. 
I am giving you gum for that. 
Where is he? 
Where is "kev"? 
It's game go. 
What are you doing? 
What... 
game go is not a phrase. 
I don't know. 
I just got really wound up at the thought of you getting checked out by some creep. 
And he's in trouble, too, 'cause I watched some boxercise videos on demand before coming down here. 
Hi. I'm Criss. 
This is Cat. 
This is Kevin's daughter. 
She's awesome, unlike Kevin, who is wearing a rope bracelet. 
And I did not give it to him. 
People assume I gave it to him, but I'm like, "you're not pinning that on me." 
I can't believe you really came down here to try to fight my date. 
That hasn't happened to me since senior prom, when Rob Sussman tried to fight Richard Sallatto because they had secretly broken up with each other the night before. 
Why are you so out of breath? 
'Cause I ran all the way down here. 
Why didn't you just take the subway? 
'Cause that's not romantic. 
Watch a movie, Liz. 
I wish my boyfriend did stuff like this, but I feel the passion is gone since he left for college. 
I'm totally messing with you. 
Guys, I'm 11. 
Oh, thank God. 
That is not funny, young lady. 
It's a little funny. 
I'm sorry, j-mo. 
I called the front desk, but there's no one else down there. 
Paul didn't come. 
I guess I faked this stupid breakdown for nothing. 
Jenna, I've been thinking. 
Why? You're famous. 
I know, but I don't think you were faking anything here. 
Maroney, you jumped through a window. 
You made out with paz de LA huerta at a children's museum. 
You tried to dine at balthazar without a reservation! 
And you did all that to get some guy's attention. 
That's crazy. 
That's a breakdown. 
I think I've made the biggest mistake of my life. 
I've never made a mistake, so I don't totally understand, but I'm here for you, J. 
Of all the crazy things I did, you know what the craziest was? 
Letting Paul go. 
I was scared to be happy. 
Now I never will be. 
I'll take this regret to my grave. 
You mean our grave. 
Where we'll lie on top of each other in one coffin, pelvis to face, for eternity. 
You were here the whole time, taking care of me. 
I was afraid too, Jenna. 
I had to be sure that you wanted the same thing that I did. 
And now I know. 
You sick bitch. 
Tracy, if you'll excuse us. 
No, Paul. 
If it wasn't for Tracy, we wouldn't be here right now. 
He can stay. 
No, I'm cool. 
I'm gonna leave. 
 Lemon, how did your date go? 
 It was amazing, but not in the way that you would expect. 
Cat's a great kid, isn't she? 
You really thought I'd set you up with Kevin? 
I've been trying to fire him ever since he invited me out on a Halloween party bus. 
But his daughter's terrific. 
So you set me up on a play date? 
I thought Kat would remind you why you purchased the princess Leia costume in the first place. 
Don't give it away just yet. 
That's very nice of you, Jack, but you need to learn that some women choose to be childless and are content with that. 
This is not a choice. 
Oh, you are being so trans-vaginal right now. 
The past few days have only confirmed my fear that we're running out of good Americans, so honestly, your country needs a few more Liz lemons. 
Oh. Okay. 
So this has nothing to do with Criss? 
I don't care how you do it. 
I don't care if you join the big sisters and torture inner-city girls about punctuation. 
Any amount of lemon is better than the crap we're turning out lately. 
Exsqueeze me, Mr. D. 
Couches are ready to ship. 
In trucks. 
Ship in trucks. 
What? 
Wait, you sold them? 
To whom? 
I just had to find a buyer who has too much money and loves to waste it. 
So every defective sofa that Kouchtown makes will be purchased by your beloved tax-and-spend government. 
What are they going to do with them? 
Sink them and make a reef to protect gay turtles? 
I don't know, lemon, and I don't care. 
Mr. wang, 
we know you were spying for north Korean intelligence. 
Give me something I can take back to Langley. 
Then we'll get you out of the couch and send you home with a CIA gift bag. 
I totally blew off that week of Korean we did. 
Let's get the translator. 
 I think maybe I still... 
 I don't think you should... 
 want to be a mom. 
 Give up on having a kid. 
Okay. 
We're on the same page. 
I think we've talked about it enough. 
Maybe we just put a pin in that and have some fun. 
I'll open a puzzle. 
I'll make a stew. 
Life is happening. 
When did gum get so soft, you sons of bitches? 
You know what this country used to chew? 
Tree bark. 
Glass. 
Shotgun shells. 
The broken swords of our vanquished enemies. 
That's why I buy Bazooka Joe gum. 
It's like chewing a Mountain that someone shot a freeze ray into. 
What's wrong with this country? Huh? 
When did we lose our way? 
Detroit? 
Life is hard. 
Shouldn't everything else be harder? 
Bazooka Joe gum! 
There she is! 
Whore of whores! 
My Frankie could have any woman on earth,  and he chose you? 
 Ma! 
What are you doing here? 
Why can't you just be happy that I'm happy... 
 With Liz? 
 Can I just say one sentence? 
Dio mio,i'm an old fool. 
What is wrong with me? 
My boy's in love! 
Come over for dinner. 
Tonight. 
Do you like ox, Liz? 
I'll defrost an ox for you. 
Look, if the situation was reversed, you know I'd pretend to be your boyfriend. 
I have a boyfriend. 
In Canada. 
Seriously. 
Chris is in Canada for the week. 
And I can't be your girlfriend, 'cause I'm not an old pedophile. 
We prefer the term adultophobe. 
Lynn, what is going on here? 
Well, I'm hiding from Sylvia. 
I got really good at hiding in prison and making wine in my toilet. 
Does your mom not know you guys are together? 
It's been a year. 
Sylvia doesn't approve of me. 
No one can remember why anymore. 
You were his teacher, and you seduced him. 
Look, here's what happened. 
My mom was snooping in my room, 'cause she loves me, and she found a letter. 
Look what I found in your pornography collection... 
A love letter. 
Who sent this to you? 
Who is "L"? 
So you told her "L" was me? 
Liz, we just need you to go along with this until... I don't know, 
my mom dies. 
Or I die. 
No. I'm not helping 
to protect this. 
 It's creepy. 
 This is creepy? 
In prison, I was part of a fake family with a bald woman, and our son was a basketball with a wig on it, but... okay. 
This is creepy. 
Frank, tell your mother the truth, 'cause living a lie will eat you up inside. 
Like that parasite I got from eating Sushi on AmTrak. 
30 ROCK S01 Ep. 10 Alexis Goodlooking 
and the Case of the Missing Whisky  That's quite a suit, Kenneth. 
 Thank you, sir. 
All my suits are my late father's... 
Mr... 
That's weird. 
Kenneth, since you've left the page program, finding you a new position here has been one of the most difficult challenges of my career. 
And I'm including making it through the '80s without having sex with Belinda Carlisle. 
I know, sir, but I just couldn't work in ad sales. 
We have far too many sponsors that make housework easier for women. 
That's why I'm putting you in the standards department. 
You'll be responsible for keeping the airwaves free of content that might offend any group. 
It's a good starting place, but Kenneth, if you wanna make it in the business world, you can't be so... 
Morally stubborn. 
There are gray areas. 
No, sir. 
There's always a right and wrong. 
Before he died, my father gave me a piece of advice. 
"Son, if you wanna get ahead in this world... 
Oh, God, this hurts... 
Tell your mother I'm gay." 
Nerf rifle. 
Mass Effect 3. 
What else do we need for, uh, research? 
Well, I need the deutsche grammophon box set  for my opera sketch. 
 An opera? 
Is there singing? 
Because I sing. 
Tracy doesn't sing, so I should do it. 
The audience expects it. 
I'll sleep with you. 
No, Jenna, none of this stuff is really for sketches. 
We're just saying that so we can charge it all to the show. 
It's the perfect crime... 
As long as Pete never finds out. 
Who drank this? 
This is the scotch I was saving for my birthday. 
Someone with a key to my office, a janitor or a security guard or some black... 
Hearted individual, probably white, has ruined the Hornberger hang for all of us! 
Let's get forensics in here. 
Have the techs lift a latent print, and run it against AFIS. 
Maybe the perp's in the system. 
J-Mo, you sound like a cop, and I should know. 
My Uncle was a cop... 
In a porno. 
Tracy, every blond actress in the business has done a pilot about a tough but pretty lady cop with special abilities. 
Mine was called goodlooking. 
I played Alexis goodlooking who was also good-looking, and my special ability was being good at looking for clues. 
Let's get forensics in here. 
Have the techs lift a latent print, and run it against AFIS. 
Maybe the perp's in the system. 
Unlike my husband's killer, who got away, and it haunts me. 
You know what? 
We should use your skills to solve the case of Pete's missing booze. 
That was a long time ago, Tracy. 
My detective days are over. 
You sure about that? 
Because like all black actors, I have a lot of experience with playing a wise black fellow who gets reluctant white people to do things. 
Well... 
I'm just an old fool, of course, and I don't know much about politics or the like. 
But I do know America's kinda like this here crab apple tree... 
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. 
All right, I'll do it. 
Let's ride, partner. 
I have some real problems with this Law & Order SVU script. 
We can't say "dick wolf" on TV. 
Listen up, standards and practices. 
I just had an emergency meeting with legal, and we can no longer use the words "hit, great show, fun," or "broadcast television." 
Now, Kenneth... 
Mr. Donaghy, Bradley Tarkin, 
junior compliance associate. 
We met last year at your completely silent presentation on the power of eye contact. 
Yes. 
I believe it was entitled... 
I was just an intern then, but afterwards, I got you to sign my first edition Jack attack. 
You know, the first edition has a typo. 
When I took over microwaves, I said to the team, "by the end of this quarter, "we're all gonna be in the black... comma... guys." 
Not, "we're all gonna be in the black guys." 
Anyway, nice to meet you again, Bradley. 
Kenneth, a word. 
Balloon! 
Kenneth, you are now officially in the business world. 
Bradley is trying to destroy you. 
Destroy me? 
He's the best friend I've ever had, tied with everyone I've ever met. 
Kenneth, if you learn one thing from me, it's this: In business, you have no friends. 
Let me tell you a little story. 
There was once a man named... 
Henry Warren. 
Henry pretended to be my friend, but he turned out to be my very first Nemesis. 
We got the contract! 
We're gonna make the bottles for new coke. 
And I'm gonna make sure you get all the credit. 
Aces! 
Let's do some cocaine. 
My friendship with Henry was a lie. 
We were just waiting for the chance to destroy the other one. 
But Bradley gave me my nickname. 
"Susan." 
Like "lazy Susan," 'cause I'm lazy and effeminate. 
Bradley is dangerous. 
Last year he was an intern. 
Now he's a junior compliance associate. 
How did he get promoted so quickly? 
I signed his book. 
He had my signature. 
He probably put it on a forged letter of recommendation. 
Sir. 
That's awfully paranoid. 
Exactly. 
"Paranoid," from the Greek "para" meaning "beside," and "noid," which is some sort of a... 
Pizza demon! 
No, that can't be right. 
The point is, you've got to be paranoid, Kenneth. 
You've gotta go in there and crush Bradley like I crushed Henry Warren. 
But I've never crushed anyone except accused witches. 
Get in there! 
 Be cool, be cool, be cool. 
 How did you get in here? 
Frank said you couldn't come to dinner because you weren't feeling well. 
But I know the best thing for a fever is food, wine, and cheek pinching! 
So I packed everything up, prayed to the patron Saint of locked apartments,  and here we are. 
 No. Absolutely n... 
You don't have a say in this! 
Now, lie down. 
While I'm here, you do nothing. 
As we say in Italy... 
Eat an arancine. 
I love our little family. 
Pete? 
Yeah, I saw him earlier today. 
Why? 
Something wrong? 
Someone drank his scotch. 
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? 
Why would I? 
I was gonna drink it with him on his birthday. 
Okay, but if you think of anything, use this phone as a reminder to call us. 
I may not pick up, 'cause I lost my phone just now. 
If you think of anything, call us. 
Hang on. 
This chair's been moved. 
Read him his rights. 
I should tell my husband I'm gonna be late tonight. 
No, wait, I can't. 
He's dead. 
Hang on. 
The trash was moved. 
Hiding something, Mr. Lutz? 
Okay. I drank it. 
We all drank it. 
We wanted booze, but we didn't wanna hang out with Pete. 
It's the worst! 
He always brings out his guitar and sings. 
He's got one story, and it's about him seeing Phil Donahue at a mall. 
Now comes the worst part. 
The paperwork. 
What's wrong, Susan? 
Mr. Pfister 
just took me to the woodshed, which I didn't even realize could be a metaphor. 
I guess I signed off on a script where an Asian character refers to "Rindsay Rohan" posing for "Prayboy." 
But I know that's very offensive. 
Especially because asians are under-represented  on this network. 
 Exactly. 
If there are more actors of Asian descent... 
Shut up! 
Just shut up, Roy! 
 I am talking to Kenneth. 
 I'm dealing with something! 
No one wants to hear from you. 
I don't even remember reading that script. 
It's... your signature 
on the memo. 
That does look like my "X." 
Susan, as a friend, quit before they fire you. 
Your meatballs are good! 
Like Ikea good! 
Is there parmesan in this? 
And Lemon. 
And a little fennel? 
Are you sure you're not Italian, Liz? 
Maybe from the North? 
That's where the vampires used to live. 
What's the matter, Frank? 
You're so quiet! 
You're sitting at dinner next to a beautiful older woman. 
Eat something and kiss her! 
No! I can't do this. 
Ma, Liz isn't the "L" in that letter. 
It's... 
Lynn Onkman. 
Elizabeth, I'm gonna ask you to leave. 
But this is my... 
I don't think Bradley's my friend. 
I hate to say, "told ya," because it reminds me of my one-night stand with Nikki finke. 
He's trying to get me fired. 
What do I do? 
Pray for a body switch mix-up so we can see the world from each other's perspectives? 
No. You destroy him. 
With this. 
I did some research. 
And unlike what he wrote on his application, Bradley never graduated from Syracuse. 
He's four credits shy of a degree in bro studies. 
You slip this transcript under your manager's door, and he's fired. 
No! I can't do that. 
It's wrong! 
If you don't get him, he gets you. 
And that little snake keeps slithering up the corporate ladder instead of a good man like yourself. 
Kenneth, sometimes you've gotta get your hands dirty for the good of company... 
And country. 
My two favorite kinds of music. 
Hey, everybody's just sitting around in there waiting for you two to shoot promos. 
Thank God I've got my awesome Phil Donahue story. 
Pete, there's been a development in the whiskey case. 
What? No! 
Forget the whiskey! 
Look, all I wanted to do was hang with my friends, rock some jams, and tell the story about my cousin seeing Phil Donahue. 
I mean me! 
I-I'm the one who saw him. 
We just wanted to tell you... 
We don't know what happened to your whiskey. 
What was that? 
He doesn't need to know how it went down. 
It would hurt him too much. 
I broke the number one rule of being on the force. 
Don't fall in love with your car? 
No. 
I let it get personal. 
You're right. 
The car thing is stupid. 
The thing is, the writers got away with it. 
So what are we gonna do about it? 
We're goin' rogue. 
Hey. 
Sorry about last night. 
Yeah. 
I had to sleep here. 
You know, they turned the heat off. 
If I hadn't found that other blanket, I'd... 
Wait, where'd it go? 
Oh, God. 
It was mice! 
The blanket was mice! 
So... what happened 
with Sylvia? 
You were right, Liz. 
Lying to my mom was stressing me out. 
I mean, I haven't gained weight in months. 
It wasn't worth it. 
So what, you broke up with Lynn? 
 Just promise me... 
 Here. 
That you'll take care of yourself. 
Don't let Liz work you too hard. 
I do really hate her. 
I think she's a terrible person. 
First of all, why were you in my bedroom, and why would you tell me that part of the conversation? 
It's the only part where we weren't having break-up sex. 
 Come on! 
 Look, I'm sorry. 
And I appreciate everything you did, so... 
I made you some meatballs. 
It's my mom's recipe. 
 So you're sure you're okay? 
 Yeah. 
Definitely. 
With all this behind me, I'm... happy. 
Thanks. 
Eat them now! 
Quiet. 
I do the talking. 
Henry. 
Henry Warren? 
Henry Warren-Chang. 
I married a very bossy Chinese lady. 
What on earth are you doing here? 
 Please, sit down. 
 Thank you. 
I haven't seen you since the 1985 G.E. talent show 
when I convinced you to sing Monster mash, knowing full well that Jack Welch is terrified of monsters, and I ended your career. 
Not "ended." 
Doing quite well, actually. 
In publishing now. 
Encyclopedias. 
I wanted to stop by because a young man named Kenneth parcell came to my office this afternoon. 
He did? 
What did he want? 
He wanted to find out if my life turned out okay after you took me down. 
Because he's afraid he might have to do the same thing to someone else. 
 And what did you tell him? 
 I told him the truth. 
I'm great. 
I lease a certified pre-owned lexus, both my sons are magicians, and for my birthday, wei-lin got me tickets to the Broadway show Memphis. 
So...... 
And I see that you've done very well for yourself. 
Well, that sofa is made from sea biscuit. 
Well... 
We're both very impressive. 
But at what cost, Jack? 
The first couple months that we worked together, we were good friends, and then we turned against each other and... 
Come on, Henry. 
We were never friends. 
We were pretending so we could learn each other's weaknesses and then... 
Exploit them. 
But what about all the dinners? 
I mean, we talked for hours. 
 I was gathering information. 
 All right. 
What about the drive up to pittsfield when we stopped at sturbridge village? 
Remember? 
We had fun. 
We saw a candle being made. 
I didn't really care about that candle, Henry. 
I don't even remember what color it was. 
Regular white-tan candle color, Jack! 
You know what? 
I really feel sorry for Kenneth parcell, because you're gonna beat all that's good out of him and turn him into another paranoid corporate killer. 
I remember our trip to Hilton head. 
That wasn't me! 
Take a sit 'cause no one is going anywhere! 
We know you all drank Pete's scotch... 
So here's how we're gonna play it. 
You're gonna hang out with Pete every night this week. 
Why would we do that? 
'Cause we have you dead to rights, you black bastard! 
And if you don't play along, we tell Pete about your little scam... 
How the show's been paying for your video games and nerf rifles and pornography. 
That's right! 
We know you ordered a porn version of Temple Grandin entitled ten poles rammed in. 
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. 
Let's get outta here, Maroney. 
The sight of these people plus the crayons I ate earlier make me sick. 
Sing us a song, you're the guitar man and this is Pete's birthday night Any mysteries that need solving, Liz? 
 Actually, yes. 
 What happened? 
Who attacked you and gave you that haircut? 
No, it's these meatballs. 
They don't taste right. 
There's an extra ingredient. 
It's something familiar. 
P.S. I love you 
is so sad. 
No one should have to be married to Gerard Butler. 
Or hilary swank! 
It's tears! 
Frank was crying when he made these. 
He lied! 
He's miserable. 
But I don't understand. 
He seemed so happy earlier. 
Forget it, Tracy. 
It's midtown. 
Kenneth, don't do it. 
You can't destroy Bradley, you... innocent goon. 
You're the most remarkable person I know, and I've met jaleel White. 
Incredibly charismatic. 
He makes Stefan urquelle look like Steve urkel. 
 But my career. 
 Forget about your career. 
I'd rather see you get fired and lease a car than watch you turn into someone like me. 
Now, give me that transcript. 
So you're trying to help me. 
Of course I am, Kenneth. 
I'm your friend. 
It's just... the other day 
you said in business I have no friends, and you were right about Bradley, so what does that say about you? 
Maybe you're afraid I will become you. 
I'll climb that corporate ladder until I eventually take your job. 
And then where will you be? 
Out on your ass like stone Mountain's mailman riding his trusty donkey erasmus. 
That is some high-level paranoid thinking. 
Like Hitler... 
Or Willy wonka. 
If you're thinking that way, then I'm... already too late. 
Why are you keeping me late to write the cold open? 
 Well, you know politics. 
 I don't know anything. 
I get all my news from the radio in Grand Theft Auto. 
Frankie! Are you okay? 
La Donna di scoregge called and said you were sick, so I came by to make you chicken soup. 
 Where can I kill this? 
 Wait... Liz called you? 
 No. She called me. 
 You! 
How dare you? 
Get out of my Liz's office. 
You said Frank wanted to get back together. 
Why would you tell her that? 
I said I was happy. 
You lied... you're miserable. 
You cried in my food! 
Sylvia, your son is not sick. 
And Lynn, Frank didn't actually say that he wanted to get back together. 
So I wore my sexy underwear for nothing? 
I'll kill you! 
Ma'am, I am in a Mexican prison gang. 
You kill me, Los Tiberones will green-light a 1-8-7 on you, and you don't want that kind of heat. 
Sylvia, your son is not happy. 
And not that you care, but neither is Lynn. 
That's true. 
When Liz called me, I was getting this tattoo. 
I'm not creative. 
And believe me, I get it. 
This shouldn't work. 
I mean, how they met is disgusting. 
Their age difference is just weird. 
They shouldn't go together. 
But you know what else shouldn't go together? 
Veal, fennel, lemon, cheese, and pork. 
That's right. 
Your meatballs. 
Lynn and Frank... 
Are just as good as your meatballs. 
That's it? 
We're meatballs? 
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. 
Do you have any idea what I've been through for love? 
Public humiliation. 
Johnny Carson in his monologue said I was looking at 20 years, but I'd probably be more attracted to 12. 
I mean, that's an okay joke, but it hurt. 
And then prison, where we only had one movie with dabney Coleman and the kid from E. T.? 
 Cloak & Dagger? 
 Shut up, Liz. 
I lost my house, my life, but it has all been worth it. 
I mean, even if I never see Frank again, it was worth it. 
And you call us meatballs! 
Elizabeth, I'm gonna ask you to leave. 
Okay, but if you look at my Internet history, I'm researching a movie about two male centaurs kissing. 
I was wrong. 
This isn't creepy because you're dating your teacher. 
This is creepy because you're dating your mother. 
You found someone just like me because I'm the woman you really wanna be with! 
'Cause you're the best! 
Frankie, you're the best. 
My big family. 
And Phil Donahue's walking past cinnabon and he's making eye contact with me I can tell by his smile that he'll stay for a while and say, "Pete, you're who I wanna be" Well, maybe I never did go to college or travel around the world. 
So I don't know much about worldly things like taco meat and having all your fingers. 
Lord knows some of my friends are just shrubs I put hats on and get high with. 
My wife had two of the president's babies, and you're one of 'em. 
I can tell you one thing... 
I'm gonna kill all y'all in y'all sleep. 
Now, I don't know nothing about no literature or history, but I'll tell you what I do know. 
This movie was written by white nerds. 
Cut! 
﻿1 Live television. 
Who cares? 
Who cares? Everybody. 
We love live TV. 
Do we, Lemon? 
Do you really love the overzealous studio audience who will applaud at anything? 
Here in the greatest city on earth, New York City, baby? Whassup? 
Wait, what are you saying, Jack? 
'Cause "TGS" is live. 
Not any more. 
It's financially impractical. 
From now on, you write and shoot the whole season in two weeks like "Wheel of fortune" or FOX news. 
No. 
I mean, I grew up on live TV. 
In my paren't basement on a friday night. 
A telethon and cheese steaks. 
I can see it like it was yesterday. 
Best sweet 16 ever. 
I'm going to lose my virginity in nine years. 
"TGS" has to be live or it will lose all the excitement and spontaneity. 
That's the beauty of live TV. 
Anything can happen. 
There's a bathroom in here you can use, Cabletown coworker Kim Kardashian. 
See? 
Awesome. 
Yes. 
But my way is cheaper, and you only have to work two weeks out of the year. 
I want to go to there. 
So it's settled. 
Tonight is TGS's final live show. 
What? 
No, live television is an American tradition. 
You can't just throw it away! 
Sorry, Kenneth. 
It's a done deal. 
Our last live show? 
No. 
 Let's go it's a "30 ROCK" live show for Pacific time  ***  I'll sing the latest news from the NFL draft  *** 30 ROCK s06 ep19 - Live from studio, west coast. 
There's a rumor spreading around here like wildfire around here. 
But unlike the wildfires I've started, this one doesn't sexually arouse me. 
It's true, Hazel. 
This is our last live show but don't worry. 
It won't affect you. 
Unless my plan all along was to run on stage during the middle of a sketch and get discovered by Hollywood. 
Liz. 
An important me-nouncement. 
Paul and I have decided to get married. 
Oh. Wow. 
And I told him to propose tonight on TG. 
 Absolutely not! 
 You didn't let me finish. 
S. 
Come on Jenna, it's our last live show. 
Exactly! 
And if Jenna Maroney is getting engaged, it's going to be on live TV. 
I've been working on my reaction since I was 3. 
Aaah! 
It's happening, Liz. 
Miss Lemon, Mr. Jordan just discovered you 
can get pornography on the Internet. 
Oh, my god. 
He's going to die in there. 
What's going on? 
You called a meeting, Lemon. 
Actually, I called it. 
Gasp! 
Live television is sacred, and we are not leaving this room until the 12 of us have agreed to defend her. 
There is a great American play that was first written and performed for live television. 
It's called "12 angry men." 
No, we are not debating this like a jury. 
Shut him down, Jack. 
"12 angry men" is preposterous Kenneth. 
11 decent Americans are swayed by Jane Fonda's father? 
Open the door. 
How long do you think you'll get away with this? 
Jenna or Hazel will notice we're missing. 
Have an amazing show tonight, everyone. 
I love you all. 
Tonight's the night, Hazel. 
I do my surprise cameo it goes viral, I take medicine for it. 
Next stop, Hollywood, Florida to get the car from my mom. 
Next stop, California, pizza kitchen. 
And tell my old boss, to suck it. 
Next stop, Tinseltown, because Christmas decorations are really cheap this time of year. 
Nothing brings our country together like live television. 
And studio 6h is part of that tradition. 
Why it was right here that NBC broadcast the final episode of the 1950s classic, "The Lovebirds." 
It's the grandpa replacement comedy hour sponsored by Kraft Singles. 
Made with milk, is the cheese that won World War II. Don't ask how. 
And now, "The Lovebirds." 
Starring Cubby Gilmore and Loretta Fields. 
I'm home, baby. 
And I could eat a horse. 
Don't you dare touch that bacon till it's done, Larry. 
Ooooooh. 
Ooooo-boy. 
Oh, brother, now I'm cooking a Turkey, too. 
That's rich. 
One of these days, Doris, I'm going to take a shot and blam! 
Blow your face off. 
It would still be better than our honeymoon. 
What was wrong with Niagara Falls? 
Your mother found it chilly. 
You're a real cut-up. 
In fact, one of these days I'm gonna cut you up in pieces and feed you to the neighbor's dogs. 
It will be the first time you've taken me out for dinner in years. 
Keep it up, Doris and bang, zoom, I'm going to drown you in the bathtub and say a mental patient did it. 
Like I always say... 
Aaaaachh. 
That's a funny thing to say. 
This is real. 
Real heart attack. 
Here, eat the bacon. 
It'll lubricate your heart. 
Ride it out. 
Ride it to hell. 
Come on now, Larry. 
Don't be a sissy... 
I'm having a heart attack, too. 
My marriage is a sham. 
I got syphilis from Orson Wells. 
Hello I'm doctor Harold Spaceman. 
I'm known in the industry as the "Gay doctor", because I always have a smile on my face. 
Because I had homosexual lovers. 
Are you a modern woman who is in the family way? 
Smoke Chattertons cigarettes. 
Your baby's lungs need refreshing nicotine for science reasons. 
And his growing bones need tar to hold them together. 
Nine out of ten doctors surveyed said, You have a lot of nerve calling here Spaceman, after what you've tried on my nephew. 
 Chattertons tastes so cool and mild  a treat for you and your unborn child  Official cigarette of the American heart association. 
Jenna, remember that package you made me take to Singapore last summer? 
I just got out of Changi prison. 
Thank you. 
Just portion control and exercise. 
Paul! 
Did you pick up the ring? 
Liza Minnelli's baby tooth surrounded by rubies that passed through a terrified Michael Kors. 
It'll look amazing on camera. 
Look . I don't want 
to propose on TV. 
I want it to be private. 
What are you saying, Paul? 
Rick Santorum is right Jenna. 
Marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman. 
Which is why I'm asking you right now to make me the luckiest schman... 
Look, I'm sorry to play the biological woman card here, but according to Roe v. Dwyane Wade, 
I have a right to choose. 
And I choose a televised proposal. 
If you can't give me that, I'm not sure what my answer will be. 
Are you giving me an ultimatum? 
Look, I am the man here, Jenna. 
I may have a dress and a wig and a gynecologist, but I am the man. 
Without live TV, think of the amazing moments we would have missed. 
The moon landing. 
The Beatles. 
"The voice" results show. 
That time Mr. Lutz was an extra 
and he got so nervous he threw up. 
No, don't remind him. 
Oh, I had a lobster role and two yogurts. 
And what about Joey Montero's old variety show? 
He was just like you, Mr. Jordan, 
because he did not want to rehearse and he wanted to leave as soon as possible. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Joey Montero. 
 Que facciamo con questo  my love is nowhere in sight  que facciamo con questo  I ask the moon every night  We've got a great show for you tonight. 
And even if we don't there's only two other channels, so who cares? 
I tell you, I feel great. 
I slept like a baby last night. 
I woke up crying with a boob in my mouth. 
Okay, that was the joke stuff. 
All right, here comes a lady. 
Hello, Joey, I'm Dusty Springfield. 
Sure, let's go with that. 
 When I said I needed you  I need you too, baby   You said you would always stay  I can see it inside your mouth. 
 It wasn't me who changed but you  And now you've gone away  Are we on a boat? 
That's plenty. 
Donkey Springbeam everybody. 
 You don't have to stay forever  just be close at hand  Where's the gang going tonight fellas? 
Jacobs's Steakhouse? 
You're invited too, Deedee Stringbean Bring half and half for the morning though. 
Oh, I just burped up some clams casino which is weird because I didn't even have any. 
Well, hello there glasess. 
Glamour. 
Excitement. 
What we today would call alcoholism. 
Live TV had everything. 
Well, not everything. 
Where were the black people? 
Oh. 
Actually, Mr. Spurlock, 
NBC had the first two black characters on television. 
Sort of. 
For "Alfie and Abner," NBC hired one African-American and one Caucasian because they thought two black people on the same show would make the audience nervous. 
A rule NBC still uses today. 
Abner, I'm home from work. 
Where are you, my brother? 
Here I is, Alfie. 
Oh, hell no. I am not doing this. 
NBC received a lot of complaints... 
That the show wasn't on often enough. 
So they forced Theodore Freeman to honor his contract. 
Alfie, I's done stole this catfish. 
Sir, I am asking you as a human being so please stop talking like that. 
I's gonna eat it till I'm bellyful. 
This is debasing to both of us. 
I was a tuskegee airman. 
Zip-a-Dee-goo-goo. 
You may anger me, but I believe nonviolence is the path to change. 
And I believes you can catch a rainbow in your hat. 
I'll kill you, you ignorant... 
believe it or not, they did not stop doing the show, which made for tense but thrilling live TV. 
Banjo... 
Kenneth. 
I've frankly lost track of what you were trying to convince us of with these detailed descriptions of TV shows. 
Thank you. 
Come on Kenneth. 
Times change. 
Television replaced radio. 
Cars replaced horses. 
Not where I'm from. 
Are you telling me the mayor of your hometown is a car? 
Pretty weird. 
Why are you laughing at me? 
Okay. 
Let's all take a little break. 
Hello. 
I'm test tube adult doctor Leo Speceman. 
Did your mother smoke Chatterton cigarettes while pregnant during the 1950s or 60s? 
If she did, you probably can't hear me because of fetal Chatterton syndrome. 
Turn up the volume! 
Recent studies have shown that while pregnancy is disgusting, babies do not need tar or nicotine. 
If you are currently suffering from Chatterton syndrome, clap your feet, until your service monkey dials the number below. 
Then use the rectum you have instead of a mouth to say something like "wrulgh" or "thunghth" to signify that you wish to join a class action suit against Chattertons. 
 If your mother smokend Chattertons  your sexual organs are covered in bone. 
Oh, my God, Kenneth. 
It's my period. 
It's a-gonna blow. 
We both know you're not due for another nine days. 
And I'm ashamed of you, Ms. Lemon. 
Think about your hero, Rosemary Howard. 
She wrote for the edgiest live variety show of all time, "The Gruber Brother and Nipsey." 
Hey, Nipsey, what do you get when you cross a lady driver with a with a Vietcong I don't know, Dickie. 
What do you get when you cross a lady driver with a Vietcong? 
A hundreed thousands senseless dents. 
Do it to it. 
Do it to it. 
Do it to it. 
Do it to it. 
Now, as you know, Nipsey... 
I'm the first streaker. 
Streaking's the new thing. 
We touched penises. 
We interrupt this program to bring you an NBC news special report. 
From Rockefeller center, Chet Huntley and David Brinkley. 
Good evening. 
NBC news has learned that less than an hour ago there was an explosion aboard the Apollo 13 spacecraft. 
 David? 
 Thank you, Chet. 
Chet? 
Thank you, David. 
We are awaiting further information. 
David? 
Thank you, Chet. 
Let's go to the manned space center in Houston and our reporter on the scene, Mr. 
Jamie Garnett. 
Jamie? 
Thank you, Chet and David. 
I'm sorry, sweetheart, could you move out of the way of our camera? 
We need to talk to our new reporter there, Jamie Garnett. 
Now, where is he? 
I'm Jamie Garnett, gentlemen. 
I spoke earlier with NASA flight director Glynn Lunney... 
Listen, doll, you're not making any sense. 
You're probably hysterical from menstruation. 
Go lie down and make sure you get plenty of iron. 
Maybe eat a ham salad... 
Also I'm being told that commander James Lovell... 
Honey, you have a dynamite shape, but you're going to have to shut up and let a man tell us what's happening. 
Now, is your father or a policeman nearby? 
Now, where did you find that microphone, sugar mouth? 
Was it just lying there on the ground? 
Where is Jamie Garnett? 
This just in, the NBC male news reporter Jamie Garnett is missing. 
I'm right here you mother... 
Classic live television. 
And while they never found Jamie Garnett, that woman who stole his microphone went on to become a wife. 
Has Paul not come back? 
He's not answering his phone. 
What have I done? 
Calm down. 
Paul's gone, but you're getting proposed to on the show tonight. 
By me. 
This is New York state bitch, anyone can marry anything now. 
What? 
But... 
Oh come on, think what great TV this will be. 
It's everything you want. 
No, it's not. 
Paul is everything I want. 
He's the reason to get married, not TV. 
Rick Santorum was right. 
How could I have been so blind? 
Because you're a horrible person. 
Thank you. 
Just portion control and lots of water. 
All in favor of keeping "TGS" live? 
It's still not unanimous. 
And it never will be. 
This is a business, Kenneth, and if live TV went away, the only thing that would change would be NBC's profit margin. 
That's not true, Jackie D. 
Live TV changed my life. 
In 1986 my church dance crew performed on a regional telethon. 
It was my big break. 
Flashback. 
This is for you, Jesus. 
Ow, my coccyx! 
It's not funny. 
Coccyx is the scientific term for your butt bone. 
Why are you all laughing? 
I like it. 
Coccyx. 
Coccyx. 
Hey, what do you call this? 
This is the garry-o-many core. 
Oh, my God. 
I remember that. 
That was you? 
That's when I realized I was a ridiculous man. 
Tracy, I was there. 
As a lower-level GE employee, I was answering phones at that telethon. 
When you took off your clothes, they cut to the phone banks. 
Gasp. 
I made a hilarious prank call to that telethon. 
Wait, did the man who answered sound like he had the piercing blue eyes of an ice dragon? 
Yes. 
Hello, I'd like to speak to General Electric. 
Madam, I'm afraid you're confused. 
I was a nurse in the war and I met him when he was just a colonel. 
He's the father of my child. 
General Electric is not a person. 
Toby, come talk to your father. 
Daddy, it's your son, Toby Electric. 
Alright, whoever this is, no one, no one jokes down General Electric. 
Yeah, except your mom last night. 
If I ever get my thick, manly hands on you, I will roast you alive in an oven I design myself, using two, no, three kinds of heat. 
I'm Jack Donaghy, damn it. 
Watching you get all red-faced on TV, that was the night I found my calling... 
Sticking it to the man. 
You know what? 
That night changed my life, too. 
Don Geiss saw my loyalty/handsomeness and the next day he promoted me out of poisons and into microwaves. 
Live TV made us all what we are today. 
No need to take another vote. 
"TGS" is meant to be live. 
To make it more profitable, we'll just do more sponsor product placements you should do it with the upcoming Warner Brothers movie, "Rock of ages," based on the hit Broadway musical. 
Rocking a theater near you June 15th. 
Tom Cruise sings. 
Or I'll just pay you all less. 
Kenneth, let us out of here. 
Paul didn't come. 
I ruined everything. 
Yeah, you blew it. 
So I'll just jump out at some point and lez it up with you? 
Okay. 
We're on in five, four, three, krang... 
And now, "Prince William and Prince time travelling fart detectives". 
Ha, take that, The Man! 
Prince, do you smell something fishy? 
Who's that dude? 
 Zou bisou bisou   Zou bisou bisou   Zou bisou bisou  Jenna Maroney, you're the woman I want to grow old with. 
"Old" being an acronym for oxylaprodexatrin, a hallucinogenic plant extract that makes sex terrifying. 
I want to spend the rest of my life making you happy. 
That's why I'm asking you, on TV, to marry me. 
Oh, Paul. 
No, no, a million times no. 
Not like this. 
I was wrong. You were right. 
I don't want to get married for publicity. 
I want to get married for you. 
And so you can't testify against me in court. 
I still don't know what's going on. 
Wow. 
Wow, 2.5 million people just saw that. 
And now 14 million people saw it. 
You're welcome, oh and also I broke your toilet. 
Thank you to Lorne Michaels, Jon Hamm, Kim Kardashian, Brian Williams, Jimmy Fallon, Amy Poehler, Fred Armisen... 
SNL crew, I love you, 30 ROCK crew, I love you. 
Watch "Parks and Rec" tonight directed by Amy Pohler. 
﻿1  Lemon... 
What do you think? 
"kidnapped by danger, colon, "the avery jessup story, comma, "brought to you with limited commercial interruptions "by pride bladder control pads. 
Pride: Make every room a bathroom." 
 Really, is that the title? 
'cause as the writer, I was thinking Of naming it dancing with ophelia  Don't overthink this. 
It's a classic love story. 
Boy meets girl. 
Girl gets kidnapped by asian dictator. 
Boy makes movie to get girl back. 
Girl's so grateful she does birthday things to boy. 
Boy falls asleep. 
 You're forgetting boy meets girl's mother. 
They are creepily attracted to each other. 
 What does that have to do with avery and me? 
Just stick to the story, lemon. 
Tell it exactly how it happened. 
If you get this right, gay men will be dressing up Like avery for Halloween for the next 20 years. 
 Okay. 
Oh, speaking of Halloween, are you dressing up this year? 
 Lemon, it's March. 
 'cause I'm gonna be mitt rom-mummy. 
I call it. 
You can't steal it. 
 Why wouldn't you be mitt-zombie? 
 Because I'm an idiot! 
Oh, come on, liz. 
Think for, like, one second before you buy all that gauze. 
 I didn't want to write a song for the film. 
I wanted to focus on making the film  What film? 
The avery tv movie? 
 But my manager, gary greasy, Harangued me to write a song for the film... 
 Oh, no, in her mind, she's already accepting an award For whatever this is. 
 I need to thank my co-writers, gary greasy And jesus, a homeless man I stole the melody from. 
We also filmed a video for the song for the film. 
Thank you. 
 kidnapped, my heart has been stolen   I am kidnapped and I wonder for how long   my darling gone so far  but not forever more  I am kidnapped   that's awesome. 
I didn't even realize your song was the original. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Weird al. 
 ♪ knapsack, the zipper is broken   on my knapsack and I lost my bakugan   trapper keeper, snickers bar, my thermos hit the floor   broken knapsack  What is that? 
 Weird al yankovic parodied your song. 
Like, michael jackson's eat it or adelesomeone likes food. 
   it's a huge honor. 
Like, when people wanna see your boobs at mardi gras. 
 It's nothing like that. 
I'm calling my lawyer. 
Weird al corrupted something beautiful That was written to distract gary greasy While he came down from meth. 
 Hey, kenneth, nice tux. 
 My father wore this to his high school prom. 
The theme was enchantment under the jim crow laws. 
 So, what's up? 
 Well, as you know, I recently had a minor setback In my goal to become president of television, But I'm ready to start over again at the bottom. 
 Well, we're not really hiring now. 
 I'll do anything. 
Except work in the sound department. 
Those guys are beautiful geniuses Holes. 
 Look, I'm sorry, kenneth. 
It's just the budget's really tight. 
 Okay. 
But if anything comes up, Put a message in a bottle and throw it in the river. 
That's where I go every day to fish for shoes. 
Say, old janitor, Do you know if they're hiring in maintenance? 
 Oh, we're always looking for the next generation of janitors. 
Throw your resume away on the fourth floor And we'll be in touch. 
 okay, everyone. 
Welcome to the table read for Kidnapped by danger: The avery jessup story. 
Brought to you with limited commercial interruptions By pride pad. 
Pride: The world is your toilet. 
Written by elizabeth "diablo" lemon. 
We open on a midtown restaurant. 
Jack donaghy, 50s, big irish head, Sips drinks with avery, 30s. 
 Avery, do you believe in love at first sight? 
 I believe in two things. 
Fast money and fast curves. 
 We smash cut to a night of passion In a completely dark room. 
Bathing suit areas get a workout. 
Interior, hotel room, one month later. 
Jack sits on the bed in a tuxedo. 
His cell phone rings. 
 Jack, where are you? 
 We reveal jack's high school sweetheart, nancy donovan, In bed next to him. 
 jack, who's calling ya At such a wicked late hour? 
Ya mother? 
 Jack looks around the wedding reception. 
Across the way, his friend liz think courteney cox Dances with a handsome pilot Think a young fred grandy. 
Jack turns to nancy. 
 I love you, nancy. 
I want to marry you. 
 Stop it, jack. 
Avery's here and she's knocked up. 
 Jack looks shocked. 
 You gotta do the right thing. 
I'll miss you, jack. 
Go red sox. 
 My character seems so passive. 
I mean, what if I were like, "I need to sleep with you both, one more time to decide." 
I don't know, I'm not a writer, but... 
Do that. 
 Yeah  Liz, am I going too big on the accent? 
 No, that's how people from boston sound to me. 
 Great. 
 Lemon. 
My office now. 
 Hey. 
You have amazing skin. 
 I'm married to a woman. 
 I got four inches of steel that might change your mind. 
 Sid, how long will it take to get a cease and desist order Against weird al yankovic? 
Oh, that's too bad. 
Did they also take away your handgun license? 
 Don't do it, jmo. 
You don't want to mess with weird al. 
 Oh, please. 
I'm not afraid of anyone in show business. 
I turned down intercourse with harvey weinstein On no less than three occasions...Out of five. 
 I'm telling you, just let him do it. 
Eminem backed down. 
Lady gaga backed down. 
 Tracy, I'm supposed to perform my song on fallon tonight. 
I can't do that now. 
It's ruined. 
I'll have to write a new song. 
 Don't you understand? 
He's gonna parody you again. 
That's what he does. 
That's all he does. 
You can't stop him. 
 Unless, I write a song that can't be parodied. 
 Impossible. 
What do you think phil collins Was trying to do with sussudio? 
 Which weird al famously parodied soup soupy-o. 
I'm not saying it'll be easy, but if anyone in the world Is talented enough to pull it off... 
 I'll make coffee. 
You also make coffee. 
After the coffee contest, we'll start working. 
 Yeah. 
 Really, lemon? 
You had to include nancy donovan in your screenplay? 
 You told me to write it exactly how it happened. 
 That's not how it happened. 
You took the facts and you twisted them Like chubby checker took the traditional standing dance And made a mockery of it with "the twist". 
This is a love story, lemon. 
You clearly have no idea how to write romance. 
 Hey, you wouldn't say that if you read My    mythbusters fan fiction. 
It is sexy. 
And you're welcome for not twisting any more facts. 
Like the fact that nancy got divorced for you With no idea that you'd already gotten another woman pregnant. 
And when avery abandoned you for her career, You told her to go. 
 Jack, we need to talk. 
 Now there's this hot slut. 
hi, I'm liz. 
I work for jack. 
 Diana jessup. 
And I'm glad to see the endgame of feminism Is women dressing like dennis the menace    at work. 
 Diana, I wasn't expecting you. 
 It has come to my attention that a television movie Is being made about my daughter. 
 I knew you would not approve. 
 Because it's crass, jack. 
Like personalized wedding vows or standing up in a pool. 
And to hear about it the way I did. 
My housekeeper started screaming. 
 I should have called, but I thought it would be awkward. 
I--I mean I thought you would disapprove. 
Not that there's anything awkward between us. 
 Of course there's no other reason it would be awkward. 
And I didn't dream that I was a sex slave To a squid-like alien with your head. 
Jack, if this tv movie will help, Then I won't stand in the way of it. 
But I am gonna stay here and make sure The jessup name is not soiled. 
 Of course, I'd love to have you. 
Uh, I mean, as a guest, not, uh, under a waterfall. 
 I'm gonna go freshen up. 
The train was disgusting. 
I flew here, but I saw a train from the window. 
 What are you doing? Leave. 
 No. This is weird and I am not 
letting it get any weirder. 
All my life, I have been the third wheel That prevents people from having sex. 
 Well, movie's over lizzie. 
Why don't you head on up to bed? 
 Are you kidding? 
It's your anniversary. 
We're celebrating! 
Let's get these scabs off my knee. 
 In college, they called me "the blocker". 
 I don't need a chaperone. 
 I'm sorry, but you're stressed and you're lonely And that woman has flawless skin, Like an organic chicken. 
I haven't had lunch. 
 Oh, you're still here. 
 That's what they all say. 
+ But I don't think there are any small jobs, Only small people, Like children, or a giant who's very far away from you. 
All I want is an opportunity, sir, to once again work For the greatest company that has ever existed Since the creation of earth 800 years ago. 
 I love this  This is everything that jenna will be wearing in the movie, But of course, jenna isn't as slender-hipped As avery or, uh, you. 
 Jessup women have terrible osteoporosis in later years. 
 You must crumble like greek statues. 
 You guys like factoids? 
Check this out. 
One in four americans has an std. 
Chlamydia, herpes, garden variety genital swelling  That's quite enough, lemon. 
 Rectal fissures. 
 Lemon, a word. 
Actor time-out. 
Just wanted everyone to know that I'll be method acting; Staying in character at all times. 
It's a technique that was invented By constantin stanislavski When he was four years old And wanted to act like a pirate. 
 Uh, this is lance drake mandrell. 
He'll be playing me in the movie. 
 I'll be...Becoming you. 
 Easy, chief. 
Lance, this is diana jessup, avery's mother. 
 Diana, are you a time-traveler? 
Because I don't know how my mother-in-law Could be younger than my wife. 
   Was that supposed to be me saying that? 
Because I would never use that much math In complimenting a woman. 
Their brains can't handle it. 
  it's evolution. 
 That's exactly the kind Of stuff I need to know. 
Hey, quick question, jack. 
Our underwear, is it regular black bikini cut? 
Or is it silk boxers with tweety bird on them? 
Because I have both. 
 I think you and I should Have a meeting with wardrobe. 
 The resemblance is quite striking, don't you think? 
The fighter pilot wrists, the hair like a mature otter's pelt, Shoulders you could ride bareback. 
 I'm sure you don't wanna hear this, But every woman here would love to slip it to your son-in-law. 
 Slip what? 
 Whatever. 
Drill him against a wall. 
The point is, that would be wrong, Because we all work for jack. 
But boy, I'll tell you that lance drake mandrell Seems like the next best thing. 
Wouldn't mind giving him the old skin flute. 
 Interesting. 
 Okay, how about this? 
 don't say goodbye  are you kidding me? 
Don't eat that pie, don't eat my fries, don't wear that tie, Don't smell that guy. 
We got to be better than this. 
 All right. 
 these lonely eyes  I'm sorry, did you just say baloney thighs? 
Because that's the name of the boat weird al's gonna buy With the money he makes off you...Dumb bitch! 
I'm sorry. 
I just care too much. 
 We might as well just write a song about pizza, Because at the end of the day, that's what it's gonna be. 
Oh, my god. 
If we did that, he'd be powerless. 
There's nothing you can change pizza to. 
 Because it's already weird. 
 Exactly. 
Weird al's about to get a taste of his own medicine. 
 I'm jack donaghy. 
I am jack donaghy. 
Oh, god. 
This ice tea is so strong. 
 lance. 
I mean, jack. 
 What do you need, diana? 
I'm very busy right now. 
I've got to get to the bottom of this business case. 
 I wonder if you might say something negative About obama for me. 
 "hope"? 
More like "nope". 
 And what is your opinion on hybrid cars? 
 Prius is the latin word for impotence. 
rose wine? 
 Pairs well with failed suicide. 
 Oh! 
 Oh, you know, hey, this has been great practice, But I'm late for a tooth-whitening appointment And they just freak out if you don't Give them 24 hours  no, no, no, no. 
Stay in character. 
 There hasn't been a good Non-boat painting in 5,000 years. 
   Sometimes to prevent monkey business, we must create it. 
The blocker. 
 What do you want, lemon? 
I've gotta get to the bottom of this business case. 
 Ugh, do you really have to be here, lance? 
I'm trying to find a quiet place to finish this rewrite. 
 How is that rewrite coming? 
Maybe jack should go to the gym. 
You know, the actor playing him can do four boy pull-ups. 
 Actually, jack, the rewrite is not going great Because I'm the only person willing to admit How messed up this situation is. 
 Sounds like you need some advice. 
Ronald reagan use to say  Stop right there, lance. 
Only nancy used reagan's first name. 
And only during bath time. 
 You've got a long way to go before you're jack donaghy, But, my god, you do have amazing eyes. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, hello jack. 
Both: Hello, diana. 
 You can deal with liz, jack. 
I was on my way out anyway. 
 Wait, where are you two going? 
 Out for a drink. 
 Stop acting like me. 
 How is taking your mother-in-law Out on a date acting like you? 
 Uh, it's not, obviously. 
Uh, you two go and have a good time. 
 We will. 
It's impossible not to have a great time At planet hollywood. 
   Ice tea. 
   Jack, there's a reason I can't write this the way you want it. 
I don't care if it's nancy or diana or your insistence That the jack character have an awesome catch-phrase. 
 An idea that's off the charts, kemosabe. 
 You're living in a dream world. 
 Apparently because I thought you were a writer. 
 Hey, I'm trying to help you. 
Who do you think got diana and lance together? 
 The blocker? 
 But of course that doesn't bother you, right? 
Because there's nothing going on Between you and diana, And your relationship with avery was perfect, And the only problem is that I can't write. 
 That pretty much sums it up. 
You're fired, lemon. 
I'll write this thing myself. 
 Fine, but you are in denial about your life. 
That's not a way out. 
+  Hey, guys, it's me. 
Oh, my sandwich from the other day. 
I hate to waste food, but I'll probably get Free executive sandwiches like this forever. 
Nothing can stop me now. 
It's okay. 
I'm doing great. 
Everything's gonna work out. 
 Hang on, kid! 
We pool our tips. 
 Now, here to sing her original song From the upcoming nbc television event Kidnapped by dangethe very talented jenna maroney. 
 ♪ I eat pizza, I eat cheese   I eat lots of broccolis  I eat ice cream way too fast   burritos always give me gas   fart so loud, fart so loud   yum-yums make me fart so loud   Kingslayer! 
 I've never been kissed like that, jack. 
 It's because we're so in love, avery. 
That's why we're perfect, avery. 
 Make love to me...Now. 
This is garbage. 
   Oh, mr. Subhas, 
your wife is on the phone. 
She's making dinner and she wants to know If you found any prosciutto today. 
 Why are you dressed like a janitor? 
 It's my new job. 
 But you just got promoted. 
 Well, I've had a few setbacks, But only a quitter quits, sir. 
So, here I am. 
Starting back up the ladder to my dreams. 
My career dreams. 
Not the dream where those two tennis sisters chase me. 
 You really are an extraordinary Young man, kenneth. 
No matter what happens, you always keep your chin up. 
 Medically, it's a neck ridge. 
 I mean, look at you. 
You're not just back where you started, You're doing worse. 
And even if other people say to you, "your life is a mess. 
Stop looking at your mother-in-law. 
I can't write your movie," You stay positive. 
You always believe that everything is going to work out. 
How do you do it? 
 Well, I'll tell you my secret, sir. 
I lie to myself. 
Every morning, when I wake up, I say, "everything's gonna be okay." 
But I'm lying. 
And I don't know how much longer I can do it. 
Have a swell night, sir. 
 Let me guess, you're all watching My triumph fallon last night? 
 No, you gotta see this. 
 ♪ daddy's fightin' overseas  lord, keep him safe for mommy, please   can't make up for time that's passed   but now he's coming home at last   heart so proud  heart so proud  daddy make my heart so proud   Yankovic! 
He reversed the parody. 
He normal al'd us. 
I feel so  Honored? 
 I've gotta go call my dad and thank him. 
You know he was stationed at pearl harbor? 
During the korean war? 
 Well, congratulations, lemon. 
You were right. 
I've been lying to myself. 
Maybe my whole marriage to avery was a lie. 
 Whoa, no, that's not what I was saying. 
Everyone lies to themselves. 
I mean, I refuse to buy larger underwear, And it looks like when you tie a string around a roast. 
Okay, so we agree. 
Things are complicated. 
But that doesn't mean you can't figure it all out. 
You just have to get avery home first. 
 How? 
Lemon... 
We can't make this movie. 
 Yes, we can. 
We just have to do what you've been doing all along. 
Lie...To everybody. 
 I'll never let you capture my wife from here, On the top of the empire state building! 
 Korean freeze ray! 
 Jack! 
 Nothing can keep us apart! 
Our love is off the charts, kemosabe. 
 ♪ I am kidnapped  Cut! All right. 
It's a wrap. 
All right, now let's hurry up and edit this thing. 
It's on in two days. 
 Seriously, man. 
Call me. I wanna board with 
you at big bear, all right? 
 Lance, I wanna thank you for you professionalism On this project. 
 Thanks, jack. 
If it weren't for this gig, I never would have hooked up with diana. 
I'm not one to tell tales out of school, But she's a real hotshot at boinking. 
She boinks like a dog. 
I'm not a writer. 
She made me boink her this morning And at first, I was like, "please  I get it, lance. 
Uh, thank you. 
 Wow, it's just good to be, uh, Lance drake mandrell again. 
Get back to doing the things I love, Like getting high and going to the planetarium. 
 So, thank you, jack. 
Hopefully, the next time we see each other, Avery will be home. 
 It'll all work out, jack. 
 Thanks, lemon. 
And, uh, thank the blocker for me. 
 Hey, when this movie airs, Can my name be the first credit that comes up at the end? 
 This is a group process, lemon. 
Don't be an egomaniac. 
Why did I just received this viewer essays on the subject "why I love TGS?" 
Please tell me it's not  the annual TGS viewer walk-on contest. 
It's great promotion, Lemon. 
We found that if someone is actually on NBC, they're 4% more likely to watch it. 
 Really? 
We're doing this again? 
After what happened last year? 
 Gassy Patsy, you can't eat   Keep the white house white. 
 You know who enters these walk-on contests? 
Weirdos. 
 Read the essays, Lemon. 
It's not going to kill you. 
 Oh, really? 'Cause this one 
is typed on the inside of a bloody halter top. 
 Just pick one. 
And while you're at it, which one of these ties do you prefer? 
 I thought you said a man should never wear pastel unless he's a black guy on Easter. 
 Usually, but I'm going on the today show to talk about Avery, and I need to tone down my natural aura of strength and sexual dominance. 
Which wasn't going to happen with the tie I was going to wear. 
  Oh, my. 
So, uh, what is the news with Avery? 
 Uh, there isn't any, and that's the problem. 
The U.N. is useless, 
the state department is full of democrats, and as it turns out, amnesty international is nothing but a company that makes and sells candles. 
 That explains all the vigils. 
That is a good scam. 
 It's been a year, and the media have moved on. 
 Media is a plural noun. 
Put this tie on. 
 I have to find a way to get Avery's story back on the front page. 
Fortunately, I run a network with a news division, and I will do whatever it takes to keep Avery's plight in the public eye. 
Even... 
Go and see Matt lauer's band. 
It's blues rock, Lemon. 
It's called... 
"Rhythm and news". 
 Lemon, no. 
 Sir, I've been thinking. 
I know I'm a big shot now with my suits and a desk lamp that I control, but I just want you to know I will always be a page at heart. 
Even if I did just receive a fancy award at my new job. 
 On behalf of the mother Standards department, I, Gaylord Felcher, present you with the "employee of the  week" award. 
Let's give it up for this      Bag of . 
 So what can I get for you? 
 And Hazel's on it, Tracy. 
Kenneth, can I speak with you? 
 Can you? 
You just did. 
 What's your problem? 
 Oh, my, well... 
My parents were technically brothers  look, I'm trying to do my job here. 
Tracy's my responsibility now. 
I take care of him. 
 Oh, well, I'm sorry, Ms. what's-her-name, 
but I'll always be there for Mr. Jordan. 
He has a special place in my heart. 
Just like Nana Parcell, my heartworm. 
 Ugh! 
 Hey, Jack. 
What are you still doing here? 
Your segment was bumped. 
 What? 
Why? You guys doing 
another hard-hitting expose on how to plan a staycation with your cyber bully? 
 No, it's real news for once. 
There was a mine collapse in China. 
Turns out, to keep labor costs down, all the miners there are babies. 
They pay 'em in yogurt. 
 God. 
Remember when we used to be the world leader in baby cuteness? 
I can't compete with that. 
 Also, adult dogs can't fit in the baby mines, so they're lowering down puppies to bring in supplies. 
   Hey, thanks for coming to see my band last night. 
 Yes, I didn't expect you to play for four hours. 
 Hey, dummies, I need you guys to write a sketch with a non-speaking part for whoever wins this dumb contest. 
And do not write another sketch about Krang from teenage mutant ninja turtles. 
No one knows who Krang is. 
It would be a waste of time to talk about Krang on television. 
No more Krang! 
 Liz? 
 Krang! 
What the hell, Hazel? 
 Can I ask your advice, woman to woman? 
 Are you sure? 
'Cause I took one of those "which gossip girl are you?" 
Quizzes, and it said I was the dad's guitar. 
  Please. 
You are so amazing. 
This place is such a boys' club, but you boss them around like an Amazon warrior queen. 
And look at your body. 
Your rack is like, "pow!" 
 Hazel, what is the question? 
 It's Kenneth. 
He's not a page anymore, but he keeps trying to do my job for me. 
And when I confronted him about it, he was so condescending. 
He laughed at me, and then he undressed me with his eyes. 
And then he had his way with me. 
With his eyes. 
 Ugh. The male gaze. 
 Yeah. 
They're all a bunch of gays. 
 No, Kenneth is sweet, but he's still a man. 
And in our society, men get praised for just taking whatever they want. 
But what do people call women who are tough and ambitious? 
 Leslie or Courtney? 
 What? No. 
A bitch. 
Well, you may be at the bottom of the totem pole now, but you're in the game. 
So play it like a man and don't let anyone try to stop you. 
Just like the karate kid Hilary Swank "Karate Kid IV". 
 I want you to be my mentor. 
 JulieSan, fighting not good. 
But if must fight, win. 
Kesuke Miyagi, Karate Kid IV. 
I accept! 
 You listen to me, Blitzer. 
Either CNN gets back on the Avery Jessup story, or I'll tell everyone your real name, Steel Hammerhands. 
 Hello? 
Steel? 
Mr. Hammerhands? 
 Jack. 
I have an important actor request. 
 This is not really a good time, Jenna. 
 I want you to hire a giant to stand in the background of every scene I'm in to make me look daintier. 
It works. 
It's why Lamar Odom married that giant Kardashian girl. 
 I run a TV network, and I still can't get my wife's story on the air. 
The world may have forgotten about Avery, but I haven't. 
Sometimes at night, I sit here in the dark, drinking scotch, staring at that doorway, hoping against hope that she'll walk as if nothing ever happened. 
"I'm home, Jack. 
And I brought back a bunch of oriental sex powders." 
 I know how you can get Avery back on television. 
Her story has everything! 
Blondeness, kidnapping, a villain with an accent. 
It's the perfect TV movie. 
I should know. 
I played Italian party whore in the Amanda Knox story. 
 A TV movieJenna, I don't want to trivialize this ordeal. 
 But those movies get results. 
Every kidnapped woman I've ever played has been released. 
 Well, it would allow me to control the story. 
 Well, you better hurry, Jack. 
Oxygen is already working on a movie about the baby miners. 
 Then we'll have to slow them down. 
Gabriel... 
Send a bunch of pies to the Oxygen network. 
 Excuse me, Ms. what's-her-name. 
What's that? 
 Not that it's any of your business, but Tracy's jaw is tired from pretending to be pac-man. 
So I'm making it easier for him to eat. 
 No! No! 
He can't eat that junk. 
He just got his cholesterol down to triple digits. 
 Get off my ass, Parcell. 
I'm doing my job. 
You think you can push me around just because you have a penis? 
 I definitely have a penis. 
 You think I'm some delicate little girl who'll do whatever you say? 
Well, I'm not delicate. 
I've been in tons of car wrecks. 
 Hazel, I just peed this. 
Could you take care of it for me? 
 Sir! 
I am resuming responsibility for your care. 
You are in dire need of a getting-your-act-together montage. 
 Down so low, don't know what up is   When  I'm sorry, Tracy. 
You wanna be bossed around by this trailer park Hitler? 
Or do you wanna do whatever you want with a sexy, fun bitch who just bought you a pinata? 
 Awesome! 
  Miss Lemon, do you have a moment or are you busy regretting your life choices, for example, missing your window for having children? 
 Get to the point, Kenneth. 
 It's Hazel. 
I'm trying to help her, but she's gone crazy. 
 Uhhuh. 
You can't handle the fact that a woman is doing your old job. 
What a world. 
I bet even Hillary Clinton has to put up with this crap from whoever was secretary of state before her. 
 You mean Condoleezza  Shut up. 
Look, I believe in Hazel. 
I happen to be her mentor. 
So to quote Mr. Miyagi, 
"leave girl alone or you deal with me, surf shop owner." 
 Hey, sweetie. 
How was your day? 
 Not even half over, Hazel. 
Ugh! I still have to read 
all these essays. 
Okay. 
 Look at you. 
You're a whirlwind in charge in the board room... 
And the bedroom. 
 Sure. 
 You're a modern, DTF type woman whose whole vibe says, "yeah! Dig sex and I'm not 
gonna apologize for it." 
 Okay, here's a little bedroom tip. 
Put a bag of popcorn in the microwave beforehand. 
That way, when you're done, you have a treat. 
 I wish I had your emotional intelligence. 
My boyfriend Razmig and I have hit a little rough patch. 
 Okay. 
Lay it on me. 
 Well, I went home this afternoon to get some, and I found Razmig banging the fattest chick I've ever seen. 
And you know, I used to weigh 800 pounds. 
 Stop right there. 
You didn't hit a rough patch. 
He cheated on you. 
You have to dump him immediately. 
 What? 
How can you say that? 
 Hazel, I'm trying to help you. 
 By asking me to break up with the man I love? 
Helping me would be teaching me how to spice things up. 
Like by greeting him at the front door wearing nothing but false teeth. 
I'm very disappointed in your mentorship, Liz. 
If this were two years ago, I would sit on you till you died. 
 No wigs. 
I said no wigs. 
You're not a lead, Gabe. 
At best, you're a featured extra with no lines. 
Do you understand? 
 Hey, Gabe. 
 Lemon, would you be interested in writing the screenplay for the greatest love story ever told? 
 You mean Lois Lane's love affair with journalism? 
I said it. 
 Avery and me. 
I'm producing a television movie to get her back in the headlines. 
For obvious reasons, I'm fast-tracking the project. 
The script is due on Monday. 
 Monday? 
Hmm. I guess I won't be able 
to go to the gym this weekend. 
 I know it's short notice, but I would consider it a personal favor after six years of listening to you complain about how there are so few women on death row. 
 Is a coincidence, or is the system sexist? 
Oh! Speaking 
of our amazing dynamic, I have taken on a mentee of my own, Jack a page named Hazel. 
 You're a mentor? 
But that makes me a grand-mentor. 
And I'm still so young. 
 Don't worry. 
I already messed it up. 
I told her to break up with her awful boyfriend and she got really mad at me. 
 Often, the best way for a mentee to learn is for you to let her fail. 
 Wait, does that mean you've done that to me? 
When? 
 Um  I think the crowd at the Apollo might welcome a change of pace. 
 You're right. 
You should do it. 
Sometimes, they have to learn the hard way. 
If Hazel rejects your advice, let her. 
She'll get there on her own just like you did after the crowd at the Apollo chased you into the river. 
 Okay, I understand the irony of what I'm about to say, but I reject that advice. 
Don't worry, I'll bring you back a t-shirt from successtown. 
Ow! My groin! 
 Mr. Jordan! 
 Kdog. 
You were wrong. 
They do still make crossbows. 
 You let him buy a crossbow? 
And a motorcycle? 
 No, Kenneth, I let him buy a motorcycle ramp and no motorcycle! 
Can I help you? 
Tracy's very tired. 
He didn't sleep last night. 
 Why not? 
If he doesn't get at least 14 hours a night, he starts to go crazy. 
 We on a show within a show! 
My real name is Tracy Morgan! 
 Well, Tracy wanted to go clubbing. 
And I don't know if you know this, Kenneth, but night clubs are open at night. 
 You didn't let him drink, did you? 
Mr. Jordan can't mix alcohol 
with his medication. 
 I'm not an idiot, Kenneth. 
I took him off his medication. 
 You what? 
Why are you doing this? 
 Because Liz told me to. 
Having access to Tracy is an opportunity, and I'm taking advantage of it. 
Did you see page six today? 
Those are my toes he's sucking on. 
And he did not want to. 
 Ah, mm. 
 Jack! 
What the hell is this? 
 Where did you get that? 
 Donna from casting and I are friends. 
Well, not so much friends as I own a magnet that can scramble her pacemaker. 
 Jenna, you are not playing Avery. 
 Why not? 
This movie was my idea! 
 I appreciate that. 
You can play a Korean party whore. 
I just don't think you can capture Avery's essence. 
 That's ridiculous. 
I posed bottomless in essence. 
 Jenna, Avery is worldly. 
Traveled. 
She went to Yale. 
 Oh, I see. 
You think I'm stupid, just because my college got tipped over by those Miami heat fans. 
 I didn't say stupid. 
Jenna, there are many kinds of intelligence. 
Practical, emotional, and there's actual intelligence, which is what I'm talking about. 
 I want this part, Jack. 
It's a guaranteed Emmy nomination. 
 I'm sorry. 
I've made up my mind. 
 Very well. 
But let me ask you this, Jack. 
Would a dumb person be able to think of something amazing to say as she leaves? 
 Liz, we have a show in four hours. 
Have you still not picked a contest winner? 
 Ugh! Fine, 
I'll just pick one at random. 
It's Joren van der Sloot. 
 We can't fly someone from Peru now. 
There's no time. 
 Oh, Hazel, we need to talk. 
 I'm busy, Liz. 
Tracy wants me to page for him in Las Vegas this weekend. 
Is this dress appropriate for watching pornography with Penn Jillette? 
 Okay, normally we don't encourage Tracy to go to Vegas, because of his gambling addiction and his fear of magic. 
But maybe a weekend away from Razmig is a good thing. 
 No. 
Razmig's coming with me. 
  What? 
Who is this, Hah-zel? 
I no permit you talk other woman. 
 Okay, I'm putting my foot down. 
This guy is no good for you and I order you, as your mentor, to dump him. 
 You don't know what you're talking about, Liz. 
Razmig is amazing. 
He makes me laugh. 
 Oh, where is toilet pail? 
Razmig must make mud. 
  Razmig! 
 Hazel, no. 
I'm not letting you   Let her fail, Liz. 
Let her get there on her own. 
 You know what, fine. 
You're right, I'm wrong. 
Go, be with Razmig. 
 Thank you, Liz. 
It takes a big woman to admit she's wrong. 
 You are a big woman. 
You have pictures? 
Fat nudes? 
  I need your help, Ms. Maroney. 
 Absolutely. 
Oh, I thought you were someone famous. 
You sound a lot like Reese Witherspoon. 
What do you want? 
 I'm afraid if Mr. Jordan 
goes to Las Vegas this weekend, he's gonna die. 
 I'm not hearing my name, Kenneth. 
 So I thought you  oh, thank God. 
That took forever. 
 I thought you could teach me how to get around Hazel. 
If I could just get one minute alone with Mr. Jordan 
 you can convince him he's wrong. Yes! 
But how do you get his attention? 
All the world's a stage, Kenneth. 
Just play the part. 
 Play the part? 
+  Ms. Lemon. 
If it's not too late, I would like the essay contest to win a role on TGS with Tracy Jordan. 
 No, Kenneth, you can't enter. 
The contest isn't open to NBC employees. 
 I know, ma'ammaw. 
Which is why I just quit my job at standards and practices. 
 I may  hate you right now, you little , but  damn it I respect you. 
 Kenneth, you know this is just to be a non-speaking extra, right? 
 I know. 
But have you ever loved something so much that you would sacrifice anything for it? 
 Nope. 
But you know what, this is perfect. 
Because then I don't have to pick some crazy person, and I know you won't do anything weird on the air. 
 I'm Kenneth! 
 Get to wardrobe, contest winner! 
This is gonna be a great show. 
 Hello? 
 Hi, it's Charles from the U.N. 
We found your wife and I dropped her off at the office. 
She should be there right about now. 
 Jack, it's me. 
I'm home. 
 No, you're not my wife. 
 How could you say that, darling? 
I'm Avery jesbert. 
 Jenna? 
 No, don't turn on the light. 
Surprised? 
 Let's set aside how idiotic that plan was, and imagine a world where it actually worked. 
 I appreciate your feedback. 
 If I had believed you for one second, I would've been devastated, heartbroken! 
 You wanna talk about devastation? 
How do you think I felt when you told me I couldn't play Avery? 
 You are a monster. 
What you have done here today, it's--it's... 
The second cruelest thing that anyone has ever done to me. 
Do you know what the cruelest is? 
 When I went to the bathroom on the hood of your car before I thought of this plan? 
 Avery had me committed to a mental hospital so she and her college roommate could use my yankee tickets on opening day. 
 That's a nice story, Jack, but I don't hear my name in it. 
 You  Finally. 
 You may not have Avery's grace and acumen, but you do have the one thing that makes her so special her ruthless pursuit of self-interest. 
It's the heart of capitalism. 
And the beautiful black heart of my wife. 
Jenna, you have Avery's essence. 
Congratulations. 
The part is yours. 
 Oh! You won't regret this. 
We're gonna get her home, Jack. 
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a female condom to take out. 
Unless... 
Going once... 
 Four, three  Ladies and gentlemen, a message from the president of the United States. 
 Googoo, gaga, my fellow ah-meh-ri-cans. 
 Okay, he's never been worse. 
Is Kenneth supposed to enter? 
 I love you, sir. 
 Ken, where have you been? 
 Damn it. 
 I've been here all along. 
I never left. 
And I never will. 
 Go to commercial. 
 They told us we can't do that any more. 
 What? 
 I quit my job to be here, Mr. Jordan. 
It was the only way I could get around Hazel. 
 You quit your job for me? 
 I'm not just gonna sit by and watch you destroy yourself. 
'Cause I would do anything for love, but I won't do that. 
 The girl in that video was hot in an early '90s kind of way. 
 Now... Take your medicine. 
 This has been a message from the president of the United States. 
 Tough night? 
Come on, Lemon. 
The show was all right. 
What about the sketch with the guy who was worried about his sexual performance? 
 That was a real commercial for an erectile dysfunction drug. 
 Well, I laughed. 
So, uh, how did things shake out with Hazel? 
 Not great. 
My way, which is still the right way, didn't work. 
So just to see, I did your thing. 
 Good. 
You let her fail. 
That's how the banking industry learned its lesson. 
And now they're doing amazing, and everyone's honest. 
 Mm. Your thing 
didn't work either. 
 Are you sure? 
Mentoring is not an exact science. 
 Why aren't there more female serial killers? 
What does that say about our society  Liz! 
 Oh, here she is. 
She's here. 
 Liz, I was watching the show fall apart while Razmig gave me a prison tattoo of his face, and I heard your voice. 
I finally heard everything you said to me. 
"Hazel, you're a beautiful flower. 
"Let yourself bloom. 
"What are you doing this weekend, Hazel? 
Are there still bath houses? 
Let's go to one!" 
 I never said any of that, but  you were right all along. 
You knew I was making the wrong choices. 
But you let me fail. 
With Razmig, with Tracy. 
 Yes, I was definitely on top of that Tracy thing. 
 You were teaching me the whole time, and all the while lighting a fire with that hot ass. 
 I'm... Jack. 
I'm your grand-mentor. 
Liz? 
She's beautiful. 
This next lady is from White Haven, Pennsylvania Okay! Please welcome 
to the stage Leminem! 
Ooh! 
 ♪ Ahhh, do the sprinkler,  Do the sprinkler, do the sprinkler, do the sprinkler. 
 Here we go, here we go. 
 White Haven, PA. 
 Apollo theatre. Come together... 
 Have you ever thought about the women of the world  Teen moms, grandmoms,  even little girls. 
Go White Haven. 
﻿1 Hey! You didn't whisper in my ear 
and kiss me to wake me up like you always do. 
I've never done that. 
Sweetie, wake up. 
It's morning. 
Liz:  I love you too. 
Anyway, I'm taking the van out to Queens. 
There's this big parade. 
Parades need people. 
People need hot dogs. 
That's where Van Der Beek and I step in. 
You named your van after the guy from Dawson's Creek? 
I've seen everything he's ever been in except for that. 
Please just let me pay for the renovation. 
No. 
Or we could just hold off. 
We don't need a nursery now. 
And who knows if we'll ever even have a... 
Plant or whatever? 
See, you're already backing off of this whole thing because you don't think I'm the guy to do it with. 
 You're gonna bail on me. 
 Hey! I don't bail. 
I am still watching Smash, Criss. 
Well, I'm not gonna be the reason why you put anything on hold. 
I'm getting that money. 
 Good morning! 
 Ah! 
Girl talk time. 
Fine, I'll go first. 
Since I had to move out of Razmig's place, my living situation's been a little in flux, and obviously I can't go to a homeless shelter. 
I mean, the people there can be a little sexually conservative for my tastes. 
So I was thinking... 
Maybe I could crash with you for a year or so? 
Wow! Okay. 
Look, Hazel. 
I'm sorry, but no. 
You and I do need to have some boundaries. 
Aw, poor baby. 
Can't hack it in the big city? 
Gonna move to the bay area now, pretend that that was your dream the whole time? 
Have fun always carrying a light sweater. 
Is this about when I tried to cripple you? 
Jenna, that was weeks ago. 
Bye, Hazel. 
I look forward to reading your obituary, "Least famous person in the world dies." 
Lemon, didn't you get ordained online and perform a lesbian wedding last summer? 
Yes, I married Becky and Dee because love is love and there's no reason they shouldn't experience the joy of marriage like any other couple. 
I'm not going to the container store. 
 This is my Saturday. 
 Congratulations. 
You just turned into your father. 
Avery and I want to renew our vows tomorrow afternoon and we need and officiant. 
Jack, no way. 
Wanting to renew your vows is a sign that there are deeper problems. 
You kissed Avery's mom. 
Which they both know about. 
And they're fine with it. 
They're fine with it? 
What Bill O'Reilly erotic novel are you living in? 
I suppose our situation is most reminiscent of "The Commodore's lust" from the "Patriot's after dark" series. 
Okay, fine. 
But if I'm doing this for you, guess what, buddy. 
I get your Yankees tickets on a-Rod bobblehead day. 
And I'm gonna throw that thing in front of a train. 
 Go Phillies! 
 Thank you, Lemon. 
Skinny arm-havers! 
Diana! 
What a wonderful surprise. 
I did not know you were coming up for this. 
And why wouldn't I, Liz? 
Although, a vow renewal is a little tacky, so I'd rather they weren't doing it. 
Oh, really? 
That's the reason you wish we weren't doing it. 
There's other reason, right, mother? 
Stop, drop, and roll! 
Let me out! 
Let me out! 
  30 ROCK S06Ep22 - What Will Happen to the Gang Next Year Well, Tracy, I hope you're proud of yourself. 
You were named "man of the year"... 
By the "Journal of the Aryan patriot party." 
Did they say when the banquet is? 
Because I'm kind of between tuxes due to weight fluctuation. 
Tray, this is not good. 
You are a representative of the black community. 
You're supposed to be making us look better, not worse. 
I do! 
For instance, in Pixar's upcoming movie about trash, I'm doing the voice of a lazy bottle of grape-flavored soda named Funky Bobo. 
Okay, I hear it! 
Scott and I saw each other every day at work, but we're forbidden from speaking. 
I was living in an exact replica of Cinderella's castle that Kim Jong-Un had built for his shoe collection. 
And I was kept in a pit where they made me beat my best friend to death. 
Awkward. 
Wow. What an ordeal. 
And I know a little bit about suffering because I work out... 
A lot! 
I think we have a clip. 
Kim Jong-Un's fifth Miss Universe title in four years. 
And now with sports, Scott Scottsman. 
Thank you, Avery. 
Now for today's highlights. 
Kim... 
And now with sports, Scott Scottsman. 
Thank you, Avery. 
And now for highlights. 
Kim Jong... 
And now with sports, Scott Scottsman. 
Thank you... Avery. 
And now with today's sports... 
Highlights. 
It's a code! 
Oh! I'm sorry. 
I was gonna come in here and cry 'cause I didn't get back into the page program. 
But instead I'm being brave. 
Oh, stop whining. 
I don't have a place to live, Kenneth. 
I'll have to go back upstate to that cult. 
Oh, God, I had so many husbands. 
Blah, blah, blah. 
You really don't have a place to live? 
Well, where will you sit patiently in the dark while you wait for the next day to start? 
I mean, sleep? 
Miss Wassername, you can stay with me. 
I remember how tough it was when I first moved to New York. 
I still wouldn't be able to afford rent if I didn't have a roommate. 
Have a good day, Doris. 
 "You have a good day too, Kenneth." 
Whatever, Doris. 
Grow up. 
Well, if you really mean it... 
I don't mean it, I nice it. 
You're staying with me, Hazel. 
Ah, so... 
How was your day? 
What are you doing? 
Answering your question, dear. 
My day was revealing. 
Jack, I can explain. 
You love wet feet? 
Okay, maybe I haven't mastered your code, but I'm trying to say you lied to me. 
You said you didn't do anything with Scott. 
Is this nothing? 
"I miss you at night. 
I think about you all the time. 
"I couldn't get through this without you. 
Check out Kim Jong-Un's pants. 
Where's the flood?" 
How could you do this to me? 
Scott and I have never touched, Jack. 
Unlike you and my mother. 
I thought you forgave me for that. 
Of course, darling. 
Now maybe you can forgive me for developing feelings for the only other person in the world who knew what I was going through! 
All right, we obviously have some problems to sort out, but we're going to get through this. 
 We're Jack and Avery. 
 That's right. 
We're not quitters. 
See? 
I'm not even angry anymore! 
Nor am I! 
Do you wanna watch Downton Abbey tonight? 
I'd love to! 
Maggie Smith is a treasure! 
 My soil's pretty good so I will plant this seed   My back's still strong enough to pull some weeds   I can kick out all these stones   And I can shoo these birds away   Growing together every day   We find a little sunny spot   With mornings full of dew   And I will tell the garden club   How proud I am of you   Growing together it's just botany   Growing together   Planty and me  I know. I'm sorry. 
I didn't... 
Yeah? 
Hi, I was thinking about you. 
How's the parade going? 
Uh, tough crowd. 
I had no idea the shmuley Israel memorial parade was a predominantly Jewish event. 
Criss, you don't have to do this. 
I am not gonna give up on you. 
You know what kind of women in their 40s have never been married, Liz? 
Uggos, crazies, and bailers. 
You're not an uggo. 
And you're "ha-ha" crazy, not "oh, boy" crazy, which means you bail. 
So I'm not gonna give you an excuse to quit. 
I don't care what it takes, I'm getting that money. 
Planty, no! 
I don't care about that. 
 Okay, who am I? 
Who am I? 
Doris! 
Wonderful. 
See you tonight, roomie. 
Yes, you will. 
 Hazel. 
 What? 
A moment, please. 
Let's cut through the crap, Hazel. 
I know how you think. 
You lie, you cheat. 
You manipulate to get what you want. 
I'd admire you if you weren't brunette. 
I'm a natural blonde. 
That's insane! 
Look, I don't know what your angle is with Kenneth, but you leave him out of this. 
I don't have any angle with Kenneth, Jenna. 
I've already taken care of him. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
Nothing. 
Stop looking at my ass. 
Stop pointing your ass at my eyeballs. 
It's an honor to finally meet you, Questlove. 
Tracy, this is Dr. Cornel West. 
He teaches African-American studies at Princeton. 
Yeah, brother Walter and brother Warren and I were out seen in The Five-year engagement last night, and they mentioned your concerns about the image you're presenting as a black man. 
Look, I don't wanna make us look bad, but these dumb white writers don't know how us soul cats speak, one 'twixt the other. 
And they keep backing up this truck full of money for me to do this crap. 
I don't know what to do. 
Before you change the system, you've got to change yourself, brother Jordan. 
Who were your black role models growing up? 
Darth Vader, ninjas, some black licorice I tried to make into the shape of my dad. 
That's the challenge there. 
How are you gonna be a black role model when you've never had one? 
I've been blessed to have mom and dad and my brother Cliff, John Coltrane, Curtis Mayfield, and as of last night, brother Jason Segel. 
So I just need to find my own role model to inspire me. 
But where should I look? 
Might be closer than you think. 
Maybe right under your own nose. 
Under my own nose. 
Like a mustache. 
A mustache. 
Tom Selleck! 
You've got to go to a civil rights museum. 
I'm praying for my brother. 
Excuse me. 
Diana! The ceremony's not 
for a little while. 
You might wanna pace yourself. 
Hey, are you gonna do the part where you say, "speak now or forever hold your peace"? 
I was gonna. 
Why? 
This is gonna be a mess! 
Diana. 
Excuse me, are you Elizabeth Lemon? 
During the ceremony, are you gonna do the whole "speak now or forever hold your peace" part? 
Wait, what? 
Why? Who are you? 
I'm Scott. 
I was in Korea with Avery. 
We used to tap messages to each other during the news. 
One day we made love while tapping. 
It was beautiful. 
No butt stuff. 
No, no, no. Scott, you don't 
wanna break up a marriage. 
Oh, I'm not married. 
Before I got kidnapped, Teresa and I were engaged to be engaged. 
No, Jack and Diana... Avery! 
Avery and Diana... 
Damn it! 
Jack and Nancy. 
No, do not do anything. 
Excuse me, lady. 
You do the vow? 
You know, "speak now or forever hold your peace" part? 
Oh, my God. 
Are you... 
No! I'm nobody! 
Kim Jong-Il is dead. 
I'm only waiter. 
I'm greatest waiter of all time. 
Okay. 
Oh, boy. 
Hey guys! 
Quick question about the vows. 
The whole "speak now or forever hold your peace" part... 
All things considered, it kinda feels like it's just... 
Asking for trouble. 
Liz, do the vows as written. 
Yes, this relationship has been tested. 
And yet here we are. 
To quote George W. Bush, 
Lemon, "bring 'em on." 
He said that to me in Galveston when a busload of drunk debutantes tried to get on his boat. 
It was named "Mr. water boat." 
Did it sink? 
Yes. 
Because there were too many people on it. 
But the spirit of his words lives on. 
Okay, but are you sure... 
I appreciate your concern, Lemon. 
But Avery and I don't quit. 
Ever. 
Hello, Kenneth. 
How are things with your new roommate? 
Oh, are you talking about Hazel or the raccoon that won't let me into my kitchen? 
Either way, the answer is "wonderful." 
I'm talking about Hazel. 
I know how she thinks, Kenneth. 
So I went down to human resources, turned on the old charm, and got a copy of the application you submitted to the page program. 
This isn't my application. 
This isn't even my handwriting. 
Do you know whose handwriting it is? 
Hazel's. 
She sabotaged you so you won't become a threat. 
And to think I thought Hazel was a bitch! 
Friendly and loyal like a well-trained female dog. 
But she isn't a bitch. 
She's a meaniepants. 
This is gonna be a mess. 
Police are reporting that a bank on Jackson Avenue was robbed this afternoon by a lone suspect... 
A white male in his 30s. 
Security cameras caught the getaway van heading West towards Manhattan. 
Nerf herder! 
Nerf-herder! 
Oh, come on, Tray. 
Are you telling me you haven't found one person in here who inspires you? 
What about Frederick Douglass? 
A guy with two first names? 
Next. 
That dress belonged to Rosa Parks. 
She's one of my personal heroes. 
I think I found my role model. 
Good choice. 
Sister Parks once said each person must live their life  as a model for others... 
 Shut up, Dotcom. 
I'm not talking about her. 
I'm talking about me looking funny in this reflection. 
I'm gonna do a movie where I play someone's fat old aunt and I say stuff like, "whoo-wee!" 
And "sweet child, sit yo' black ass down!" 
No, Tray, that's exactly what we're trying to avoid. 
Questlove asked me to find a role model. 
I did. 
It's Tyler Perry. 
From now on, my movies will be produced, written, directed, and seen exclusively by African-Americans. 
That's right. 
I'm starting my own studio. 
Hey. 
Hey, beautiful! 
You can't go to prison, you idiot. 
They will ravage you and your beautiful woman face. 
I'll say I did it. 
I can handle prison. 
I have a mean face and I can will myself to sleep in any environment. 
Wait, what are you talking about? 
The heist. 
They saw your van. 
Why didn't you take out the cameras and kill all the witnesses, you beautiful bastard? 
I didn't Rob a bank, Liz. 
God! 
No, I sold the van this morning... 
To a really nice young guy on Meth. 
You sold Van Der Beek? 
For me? 
I sold Van Der Beek... 
For us. 
I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over. 
And now... 
I can pay to redo the upstairs. 
And I was gonna go to prison for you. 
Even when I thought you had robbed a bank, I wasn't gonna bail. 
I won't bail on you! 
You won't bail on me. 
You won't bail on me. 
Have you ever had a girlfriend willing to Thelma and Louise with you? 
No. Never. 
But come on, Bonnie and Clyde. 
Okay, I'm a boy. 
I'm a boy, Liz. 
Also, I hear Pippa Middleton couldn't come today because Avery was borrowing her ass. 
If anyone can show just cause why Jack and Avery may not be lawfully joined together, speak now or forever hold your peace. 
Hey, Teresa. 
I just want alereeb to be happy. 
Kim... 
Where are you going? 
You're the best waiter I've ever seen. 
I know, Mr. Stepanian. 
I know. 
Great! 
So no one. 
Are you people kidding me? 
Seriously, no one has anything to say? 
You're all cowards. 
He kissed my mother. 
And she's in love with Scott. 
How can you stay silent when there's so much to object to? 
What kind of friends are you? 
I have something to say. 
I played Avery Jessup in "Kidnapped by danger," now available on Sega Genesis. 
Thank you! 
I forgot about the TV movie that whitewashed our love story. 
I was dating another woman. 
And I wasn't ready to get married. 
Both: We only did it because... 
 She was pregnant. 
 I was pregnant. 
You truly are an amazing woman, Avery. 
The only thing you're bad at is quitting. 
I kept my sea monkeys alive for 30 years. 
We're both incapable of failure, so deep down we were hoping someone else would ruin it for us. 
I mean, if we wanted this thing to succeed, why would we ask Liz to officiate? 
Because I'm good at blending humor and heart? 
I'll always care for you. 
We'll split assets in custody equally. 
I'll take our friends "A" through "L." 
You'll get "M" through "Z". 
Liz, divorce us. 
By the power vested in me by the website instaminister.Estonia, 
I now pronounce you divorced. 
 Yeah! 
Divorce! 
Whoo! 
I thought you were my friend. 
But you were trying to destroy me the whole time. 
It started that way. 
But then I fell in love with you. 
All you've done is lie to me. 
How can I believe you now? 
Believe this. 
Mmm! 
Ah! 
Don't you ever do that again. 
This would make a great room for a baby. 
You said, "baby," instead of "plant." 
Now say, "man cave." 
Never! 
Wow. 
Didn't expect to see you tonight. 
In all the commotion, I forgot to give you this little... 
Thank you for officiating our event. 
It's the remote control holder you wanted from Skymall. 
Yes! Yes! 
Awesome! 
Ah! 
Ohh... 
Oh, Criss is doing a little renovating upstairs... 
Because we are thinking about having a baby... 
Together... 
That will emerge from my vagina. 
Or a Chinese vagina. 
Okay. 
I'll see you at work tomorrow. 
Wait, that's it? 
You're not gonna give me any advice? 
I can't, Lemon. 
I don't have any right to. 
I've been, uh... 
Divorced... twice. 
Engaged two other times. 
I'm... a mess. 
But any child would be lucky to have you be the mother it loves then hates for a few years, then loves again, then half-heartedly defends to its spouse, then puts in a home. 
You don't need my advice. 
But I still want it. 
If you decide to have child, you going to make an excellent mother... 
As long as you follow Jack Donaghy's 25 pillars of motherhood. 
Number one, don't overthink the names. 
Stick to Kings and Queens of England. 
There will never be a president Ashton or a Dr. Katniss. 
Or a non-sexually confused Lorne. 
Number two... 
Ah, we had a good time tonight. 
I wonder what will happen to the gang next season. 
Will Liz have a baby? 
Will Jack become supreme leader of Kabletown? 
Will Kenneth... 
No, I don't care! 
All I want is Jack and Liz get together. 
On Friends, it was so satisfying. 
They do on Cheers, they do on Moonlighting. 
Everybody do it! 
Don't overthink it, writers. 
Whoever you are. 
﻿1 Here are all my receipts. 
Look, I don't need these, Liz. 
Your tax return is the same every year. 
Actually, I'll have you know that this has been a year of change, Howard. 
I joined an over-40 dance team, I started eating the lettuce on my plate under my onion rings, and I have taken up meditation thanks to my boyfriend Criss. 
Yeah, do you remember what you said to me last year? 
This has been a year of change, Howard. 
I'm actually eating the onion part of my onion rings, I started journaling thanks to my exciting relationship with Carol, who is a man. 
Although we have done nothing that lesbians could not do. 
Uhhuh. 
Do you remember what you said to me last year? 
I bought a restaurant-grade onion ringer, and I'm having a go at cycling, thanks to my boyfriend Wesley, whom I hate. 
Have I never washed this sweater? 
Look, there's nothing wrong with being predictable. 
Every morning I get up and come to this office while my wife cheats on me with Jared. 
Well, you're wrong. 
I bought a meditation stool, and... 
Both: This year's gonna be different. 
Jack, am I just in a permanent rut? 
I don't have time for your nonsense, Lemon. 
I'm working. 
I know this doesn't look like work, but are you familiar with the shower principle? 
I remember Mrs. Doyle 
pulling me aside to talk about it  in the seventh grade. 
 Uh, no. 
The shower principle is a term scientists use to describe moments of inspiration that occur when the brain is distracted from the problem at hand. 
For example, when you're showering. 
I was in the shower when I finally got the title of the movie Face off. 
Face off, face off. 
Exactly. 
If the cerebral cortex is distracted, by showering or putting, then another part of the brain, the anterior superior temporal gyrus is activated. 
This is the site of sudden cognitive inspiration. 
 Nerd alert, nerd alert. 
The problem at hand is this man, my boss, Hank Hooper. 
Kabletown has grown a lot over the years, but it's still a family company with a very simple goal... 
To entertain folks. 
That's all people want. 
To sit on their sofas... 
Oh, why am I putting on airs? 
To sit on their couches, and hear stories. 
Here's one. 
1968. 
We were on patrol somewhere near the Cambodian border. 
Uh, we can skip this part. 
So we boiled the skull, and made a tea kettle out of it. 
My point is, I believe that slow and steady wins the race. 
We don't take risks. 
We make profits. 
So now, let's get this dog fashion show started! 
"Everyone hide your bones." 
"Dogbeard the pirate just sailed into woof harbor." 
Ugh. 
You know what else Hank announced at that meeting? 
Record profits. 
Really? 
Can we start getting real soda? 
Because I think Corka-Coola brand diet banana lime  causes "tum nungnuss." 
 No. 
And do you know what Hank wants to do with that money? 
Pay a shareholder dividend. 
Meanwhile, the Kabletown blimp is in such disrepair, we got a "jeers" in Corporate Blimps Weekly. 
I want to use that money to transform this company, but first I have to convince Hank Hooper, a white man who still buys Cadillacs. 
I just need the right idea. 
Do you think a year ago today we were having this same conversation? 
Because it sure feels like it. 
Probably. 
And knowing you, as you were leaving you did something comically undignified. 
Well, not this time, friend. 
 Whoa, gumballs! 
 Lemon! 
  30 ROCK S06 Ep15 - The shower principle Why is all the healthy food on the top shelf today? 
Cut it out, you perverts. 
I know what you're doing. 
It's the first warm day of the year, and women are starting to take off their winter clothes... 
Good morning! 
Eyes down here, boys. 
I have breasts, you know. 
Nope, Hazel. 
Button up. 
Cerie, put on one of my soup ponchos. 
This happens every spring, and it makes Jenna feel threatened, and old, and she takes it out on me and the show. 
Every year she... 
Every year. 
The same thing happens every year. 
Take a picture, it'll last longer. 
Here you go. 
Hey, Liz, at 11:00 we have... 
Our annual budget meeting. 
You know what I did a year ago today? 
Met with my accountant, went up to see Jack, told Cerie to cover herself up. 
Yeah, stop doing that. 
Paula canceled my subscription to shape magazine. 
Why do you have to take Cerie away too? 
'Cause Jenna's gonna freak out, and she'll take it out on me. 
Last year, Jenna accused me of trying to destroy her because her lines didn't have any "K" sounds, which she thinks is the funniest sound. 
Oh, my God. 
My cousin Karl crashed his car, and now he's in a coma at the Kendall clinic. 
Well... 
Look, you don't know what Jenna's gonna do. 
Yeah, I do. 
It's in the book, and the book has been right about everything. 
It can see the future. 
Well, hang on. 
If all of your problems are in the book, aren't the solutions in there too? 
Well, we'll see. 
Last year, Jenna didn't come to her senses till I... 
It's all here. 
This is how I break the cycle. 
Today, I prove the universe, and my accountant, wrong. 
Oh, and, Pete, don't try to force a nickname this year. 
But I just bought a Letterman jacket with "the German" embroidered on it. 
It's not refundable if you personalize it! 
Jenna? 
I know you're gonna freak out today. 
You're trying to destroy me. 
I refuse to be in that sketch. 
The MacBeth sketch? 
Shh, stop it. 
You never say that name in the theater. 
It is curs-ed. 
Jenna, that's just a superstition. 
Elizabeth, I was trained in stage acting and game show pointing at the Royal Tampa Academy of dramatic tricks. 
Where I studied theater superstition, under Professor Duane "Crawfish" Kenny. 
I'm not doing a sketch about the Scottish play. 
Yeah, but this isn't MacBeth. 
It's a timely satire of MacBeth, where mayor McCheese and his wife, an ambitious pickle, murder king Ronald. 
Liz, I don't need any more bad luck. 
Do you know how many mirrors I've smashed just thinking it was a blonde woman mocking me? 
Okay, fine. 
Like last year I will... 
Just ask Cerie to do it. 
Sure, I'll do it. 
I just have to be out in time for my band to be on Letterman. 
electronic harmony] Perfect. 
Now everyone's happy. 
 That Jenna sure is a handful, huh? 
Hazel, damn it! 
I know she takes you for granted. 
But I don't. 
Say, I bought a groupon for a couples' massage at a resort in the Catskills where Henny Youngman used to take his mistresses. 
What do you say? 
No. But if you want 
to help me, just keep an eye on Jenna. 
I know she's gonna cave, I just want to make sure she doesn't do anything crazy first. 
As the doctor said to me after my hepatitis test, "you got it, sweetheart." 
Banks will provide... 
Hey, Tray. 
Hold up, double "L". 
I just want to clear this level. 
To navigate the mortgage mess... 
Tracy, that's the news. 
It's the only way we can watch it. 
Coming up next, how safe is your building's elevator? 
Yes! A thousand points! 
Sure. 
Tracy, I know you insist on doing your own taxes for some reason. 
I don't trust my accountant. 
I think he's lying to me about being Jewish. 
I step on more wine glasses than he does. 
Well, last year on this date, you flipped out because you didn't know it was the 14th. 
 So, this is an early warning... 
 Wait, hold up. 
I didn't even know it was April. 
I was gonna tell Dotcom I loved his novel as an April fool's joke. 
This is all hands on deck! 
K-9, form of desk. 
Get the receipts out. 
This big one's for your sneakers. 
Yes, do your taxes, yes. 
Why do you look so weird? 
Have I never seen you carry a bag before? 
I went and took a shower at the Racquet Club, where I saw Lou Dobbs step on his own testicles. 
It was horrifying. 
Still trying to get the ol' jumper cables on the tires of your brain muffler? 
I don't know cars. 
I get ten minutes with Hank Hooper tonight. 
Ten minutes to convince him to change his company forever. 
This is a crossroads, Lemon. 
You know what I miss about G.E.? 
The factories. 
The sight of work being done, of things being made. 
The deafening noise of machinery. 
 You have to talk like this! 
You can only say what's essential! 
And you get to point at things! 
Okay, well I, for one, am crushing it today. 
I pre-solved my Tracy and Jenna problems, my budget meeting with Pete took three seconds, and I got this meditation candle for 80% off. 
"Summer horse grave"? 
Did you say meditation candle? 
Lemon, are you planning to meditate? 
Yeah. I bought a meditation 
stool, I have a mantra. 
You have a mantra? 
What is it? 
You're not supposed to tell anybody what your mantra is. 
Oh, come on. 
Meditation is a waste of time, like learning French, or kissing after sex. 
There you are, lemonade. 
Distract her with your craziness, Tracy. 
Otherwise she's going to meditate. 
I don't have time for that, J.D. 
I have to go to Alaska immediately. 
Alaska, what are you talking about? 
Well, Ms. Lemon, 
Mr. Jordan had a lot more income 
this year than he anticipated, thanks to his frequent scratch-off lotto victories, finding all that treasure on the island he owns in the Caribbean. 
Quite an adventure. 
And designing Kate Middleton's wedding gown. 
She was wonderful. 
Collaborative, fun, and a little dangerous. 
Okay, so you have to go to Alaska because... 
In order to pay my tax bill, I had to sign on to do a movie, Five dog now five. 
 Gibberish. 
 No, that's just the confusing title Disney gave the fifth Snow dogs movie. 
The "S" s are fives. 
Running time, 26 minutes. 
Why do you need to do a movie to pay your taxes? 
You're loaded. 
I'm not liquid, Liz Lemon. 
I'm completely solid. 
I took all of my money and put it in my pool and froze it. 
Nope, this isn't last year. 
I am breaking the cycle. 
I will deal with this later, after I meditate. 
Cycle? 
I forgot, I sponsored the dude that won the Tour de France. 
Add another zero, Ken. 
"Out, out, damn spot of mustard." 
This is the first time I've ever liked this show. 
It's so funny. 
There's a saying in show business. 
The show must go on. 
And I couldn't go another minute without being around the greatest non-pornography crew I've ever worked with. 
It feels so weird being up here. 
What if I get discovered? 
 Amazing...  
 ...zing grace  
I don't care if this production is cursed. 
Like Lady McCheese, I will "screw my courage to the sticking McNugget." 
I will do the sketch. 
Let me help you down, sweet. 
Careful, don't stab yourself. 
Okay, let's take it from Grimace's family being murdered. 
Jenna, look out! 
I could have been killed. 
It's the curse! 
Sorry. 
Hard "K" sounds. 
Mm. 
  I'm going to Alaska! 
Five now dog five! 
Five now dog five! 
Everyone's trying to destroy me. 
Five now dog five! 
Five now dog five! 
Budget meeting, "the germ." 
Pam putch, car waiting times, "the germ." 
Distractions begone! 
Congratulations, Elizabeth. 
You have achieved transcendence, a state of pure inner peace, where all pants have built-in underwear. 
You have reached a plane of total enlightenment, and you are realizing that Jack was right, meditation is a waste of time, time you could have spent reading that book he gave you on business lunches, Buffett on buffets. 
But that doesn't make sense. 
If I've achieved enlightenment, how is this a waste of time? 
Let me answer your question with a question. 
Why don't you just shut up and tell me your mantra? 
Is it, "time to make the donuts"? 
What are you doing? 
"Hank Hooper is coming, Lemon. 
"I don't have time for your nonsense. 
"I'm always criticizing your shoes, but never offering solutions." 
Don't you have a big idea you're supposed to be coming up with? 
That's exactly what I'm trying to do. 
I realized something today. 
Putting, showering, they don't work for me. 
Only you can stimulate my anterior superior temporal gyrus. 
Buy me a drink first. 
Ow. 
For the past six years, nothing has been a better distraction than rescuing you from your various wrong turns on the road of life. 
And I just don't know what to do now. 
I'm scared, Jack. 
Lemon, just get another DVR in the bedroom, and then you can record all four shows at once. 
I've got it. 
Dump all the unsold dishwashers into the ocean. 
As it turns out, you are my shower principle, so shower me, Lemon. 
Shower me in the inane waters of television, food, and feet. 
You know what? 
Maybe you should try meditating. 
I am serious. 
The whole point is to clear your mind. 
Meditate, Lemon? 
I once pantsed deepak chopra while Craig T. Nelson 
taped it. 
I don't meditate. 
Hey, Liz, does your journal say anything about Frank trying to drink a gallon of milk last year? 
It can't be done. 
 Oh, God, the carpet. 
 Ugh! 
Somebody hold my hair back. 
Oh, no! 
My Johnny Choon. 
Are you all right? 
I've seen people killed with shoes, but never like that. 
I can't believe this is happening. 
I was just using the curse of the Scottish play as an excuse to act out. 
But it's real. 
Ugh, like I need another curse. 
Too busty. 
 Ah! 
 Oh! 
I'm running out of time. 
Meditate perfectly. 
Jack, tell me what to do about my... 
Boyfriend! DVR! Feet! 
SMAS mondays at 10:00! 
Female mustache. 
My casserole's burning! 
My casserole's burnt! 
Nut up, Donaghy, and meditate! 
Congratulations, Jack. 
You have attained... 
Shut up, I don't have time for this. 
Give me my inspiration. 
My God, you're good at meditating. 
The answer you seek has been there all along. 
It's right behind you. 
Behind you. 
Behind you, behind yo... 
I don't need an echo. 
I heard you. 
Meditation over! 
Behind me. 
Behind me. 
I've got it! 
You know what they'd thought when I saw up your skirt. 
Nice. 
Someone won the crotch jackpot. 
I need a drink. 
Ah! My hand! 
But I'm auditioning to play senor wences' wife tomorrow! 
Ah, ah. 
I can't take this any more. 
This curse is ruining my life. 
No, it's not. 
I am. 
What are you talking about? 
The light, your shoe, the chair, your hand. 
It was all me, Jenna. 
Wh... why would you do that? 
Because, I want to be Liz Lemon's best friend. 
I want to know her secrets, sing Motown together into hairbrushes, have a pair of vintage Jordache jeans that we share. 
But, love has enemies... 
You. 
 So you tried to kill me? 
 Of course not, silly. 
I can't afford a third strike. 
I just wanted to scare you off. 
And I'll stop, if you never speak to Liz again. 
Nice try, Hazel. 
But you made the same mistake Mickey Rourke made on that catamaran. 
You didn't kill me when you had the chance. 
Can I get you anything, Hank? 
Bottled water? 
I'm not fancy like that, Jack. 
If I get thirsty, I'll just drink the water from lunch I saved in my cheek. 
I've got one word for you, Hank... 
Couches. 
I've been thinking about what you told the investors the other day. 
Kabletown fulfills our fellow Americans' most American need... 
To sit on a couch, talking on the phone, about a TV show they're watching, based on a YouTube clip. 
Is NBC developing a show for that cat that jumps in the boxes? 
No, that's, uh... yes! 
Heh! 
As a matter of fact, we are. 
But my point is, Kabletown controls nearly every aspect of that experience. 
The phone, Internet, TV, that's all us. 
But, we don't control the couch. 
Why are we outsourcing the American dream, Hank? 
Why are the couches our customers sit on made in... 
Oh, I don't know... Vietnam? 
Taking my original buttocks wasn't enough for those bastards. 
Here's what I want to do with our profits this quarter. 
I want to make couches, Hank. 
Kabletown couches. 
American couches. 
Boy, I do love a good couch, Jack. 
You know, I'm like a couch in a lot of ways. 
I fell asleep at a Raymour and Flanigan last week, and a black family tried to buy me. 
Let's do it! 
Let's make us some couches. 
You won't regret this, Hank. 
I only have three regrets in my life, Jack. 
Not buying the Phillies, not marrying my wife sooner, and not surprising you any quicker with this hug. 
Ooh! 
Yup, same as last year. 
My situation has progressed in an interesting way, Liz Lemon. 
I don't want to hear it. 
To solve my tax problem, I called the treasury department and told them I won't pay my taxes until I see your president's birth certificate. 
They told me if I did that, they would arrest me. 
Things got heated, so I said I had a bomb. 
Hazel is trying to destroy me. 
Really? Now Hazel 
is trying to destroy you? 
Jenna, do you know how crazy you sound right now? 
Liz and I, or "Lazel," are really worried about you. 
Oh, my God. 
Doesn't matter what I do,  nothing ever changes. 
 Ms. Lemon, 
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need to get a recommendation from you to reapply to the NBC page program. 
We've already done that, Kenneth. 
We've done all of this! 
All I wanted was one shred of evidence that my life is moving forward. 
Baby doll, what about me? 
 I'm new. 
 Are you, Hazel? 
You're just another weird page, and I already have one of those. 
Aw, thank you. 
You people, you are the reason my life is a stagnant, monotonous hell! 
Oh, no, that reminds me. 
My stand-up tour. 
Add another zero, Ken. 
Jack? 
Why did you invite me here? 
Oh, you're gonna murder me, aren't you? 
 Eh, it's okay. 
 Up here, Lemon. 
I haven't secured that level from the rats yet. 
What the hell is this place? 
This is where I remake Kabletown. 
And where Americans, and for cost reasons, quite a few "foreign Americans," will make couches. 
To watch TV on. 
Do I finally understand vertical integration? 
Yes. 
Well, at least one of us got out of their rut today. 
Eh! 
Lemon, what are you doing? 
I realized today that I cannot do my job without you. 
This is all because of you. 
You're admitting you need me, and all my nonsense. 
You haven't done that since... 
You've never done that. 
I wanted a new G.E. 
I got a couch factory, but it's a start. 
Baby steps, Lemon. 
 To new beginnings. 
 Lemon? 
The cycle is broken. 
Jack, the rats have my meditation stool. 
Ah! 
Help! Shoot it free! 
Let her go, you bastard! 
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time. 
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. 
Out, out, brief candle. 
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more. 
It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. 
Would you like to try our apple dippers? 
﻿1 Hey, Liz. Package for you. 
 My trio of popcorns Simon? 
Sorry, Liz. 
I had no other way into the building. 
And I lost all my contacts after I dropped my cell phone into the penguin exhibit. 
Yeah. 
I had my birthday at the Aquarium. 
What do you want? 
You're not my agent anymore. 
Oh, I'm still getting your business mail at my parents' house. 
Your contract's almost up, and Mr. Donaghy's office 
sent over that new one for you to sign. 
I'm not just gonna sign whatever Jack sends me. 
That's insulting. 
We haven't even talked about this. 
Well, I am the king of renegotiation. 
You watch the Wonder Pets on Nick Jr.? 
I represent the turtle that tuck is based on. 
Yeah. 
No, thanks. 
I will deal with this myself. 
Did you miss me yesterday, Ms. Lemon? 
Awesome, great story. 
So, Ms. Maroney, 
did you miss me while I was gone yesterday? 
You weren't gone. 
I saw you. 
Kenneth! 
Just move. 
No... 
Mr. Donaghy fired 
all the pages for a day. 
Didn't you notice your food wasn't pre-chewed? 
J-Mo, Marty Goldstein is your accountant too, right? 
I owe him a call. 
I bet he's going to tell me I can't write off all my shoplifting. 
No. 
He's calling you about his son's Bar Mitzvah. 
Marty wants to pay us crazy money just to show up. 
Well, you know I'm in. 
Getting paid to help a boy become a man is kind of my wheelhouse. 
Hey, I have a bone to pick with you. 
Look at this, Lemon. 
The Pentagon has hired GE to weaponize microwave technology. 
This is amazing. 
That was my old division. 
If I were still there, I would've controlled every aspect of that project. 
Planning, oversight, morale-boosting T-shirts indicating everyone "survived" a certain barbecue. 
There's nothing to challenge me here at Kabletown. 
Lemon, when was the last time I said, "no, senator, you're out of order"? 
Well, I've got something for you to do. 
You honestly thought I would just sign the same deal I got six years ago? 
Well, what would we negotiate about, Lemon? 
What do you even want? 
Well, for starters, I would like a hospital bed in my office. 
A real one. 
I don't care if it's against the law to resell them. 
Oh, my God. 
How far I've fallen. 
I used to be a legend. 
When there was a deal no one could close, they brought in Donaghy. 
So it's agreed. 
You'll be moving forward with this partnership. 
You know what, I'm insulted that you think it's beneath you to negotiate with me. 
Without me, there's no "TGS," so like it or not, we're getting into this. 
Call my assistant to set up a meeting. 
And by your "assistant," you mean you with a British accent? 
I have a new assistant. 
She's a cool college student from... 
South Africa. 
Yeah, she'll be British. 
30 ROCK S06 E05 - Today You Are a Man Uh, hello? 
I'm back. 
What do you mean "you're back"? 
I wasn't here yesterday. 
Yes, you were. 
You were in the kitchen all day. 
Right over... 
Oh, that's a broom. 
I know my job is to serve you all, but I thought that after six years, you at least thought of me the way an owner thinks of his dog. 
 Kenneth, look... 
 No, sir! 
I am using my once-in-a-lifetime interruption to point out I am not even a dog to you. 
After all, when a dog goes missing, everyone's upset 'cause there's no dog milk for the babies. 
Jack wants a real negotiation? 
Well, I want a piece of the "TGS" merchandising. 
The catchphrase, "this smells," I wrote that. 
And when 20 cult members jump off a bridge together wearing "this smells" T-shirts, I should get a cut of that sale. 
Merchandising. 
That's smart. 
Here's the plan. 
I need to find a bathroom. 
Oh, it's on, Donaghy. 
Here they are! 
My favorite clients. 
Adam is going to be so excited to meet with you. 
He is a huge, huge fan. 
Yes, many of our viewers are obese. 
Now Marty, how Jewish is everyone here? 
'Cause I may need to change parts of my act. 
These are the best clients you could get? 
Don't you represent Gina Gershon? 
My Nemesis? 
My Nemesis? 
Adam. 
You said you loved "TGS." 
I was being sarcastic. 
God, I told mom I wanted Transformer's theme for Bar Mitzvah. 
You know, this sucks. 
I hate you. 
Son... 
Okay. 
We're going to go. 
Don't worry about the fee. 
You can just give it to us now. 
Oh, no. 
You're not going anywhere. 
If my boy wants Transformers, you're gonna be Transformers. 
I don't think so, Marty. 
If you don't help me out here, maybe the IRS finds out that your nine dependents are just vibrators. 
And Tracy, I'd hate for people to realize that your "charity" is just a front that has done nothing to make this country safer from Godzilla attacks. 
If anything, I've increased the likelihood. 
Hey, Kenneth. 
No, I'm not Kenneth. 
But he told me all about you guys. 
Let me guess who's who. 
You must be Toofer. 
I'm sorry, who are you? 
 I was asking myself that same question. 
And I did not like the answer. 
So I made a change. 
I'm Hazel Wassername, and yes, you may recognize me from one of my two background acting gigs. 
Dr. Lingard, 
yesterday, we heard your daughter take full responsibility for her roles in these crimes. 
Where's Kenneth? 
He took my spot the Suze Orman show. 
What a first day. 
But you got to roll with the punches. 
Just like my hero, Ivan Drago, from Rocky IV. 
This is pathetic. 
Kenneth's trying to make us beg him to come back. 
Well, we are not doing that. 
I've learned from having children that when your kid throws a tantrum and holds his breath, you hold your breath too. 
When you regain consciousness, believe me, he's ready to leave the toy store. 
Finally, my client gets 5% gross merchandising, where gross means income before expenses and not gross like apples on a sandwich. 
2% salary decrease to keep up with deflation... 
Thank Obama... 
And merchandising is a... 
Nonstarter. 
This meeting is over. 
When you have a serious offer, email me at tatertotfreak@hotmail.Com. 
From now on, you can deal with me directly. 
Simon, you're fired. 
Where did that come from? 
Are you being coached? 
Is it Pat Riley? 
Tell him the funmeister says, "hi." 
He'll know what that means. 
No one's helping me. 
Maybe you just weren't giving me enough credit when you said this was beneath you. 
Surprise. 
That's what the Donaghy method is all about. 
Use my techniques and I don't care who you're negotiating against. 
You'll win. 
I'm negotiating against you, you magnificent bastard. 
You. 
Charlotte Bob is in trouble. 
This is the part of the movie where I fell asleep. 
Jazz is gonna get you out of this. 
Say, hey! 
I am one slick brother. 
This blows. 
Be the robots from NFL on FOX. 
Boo! 
You suck. 
Here's your tea, Ms. Orman. 
 There you are. 
 Who are you? 
What happened to Hazel? 
Oh, I'm sorry, Ms. Orman. 
Hazel and I switched places. 
She's over at "TGS" now, but don't worry. 
It's temporary. 
I just want all the actors and writers there to realize how much they miss me. 
And why should they miss you? 
Well, I'd like to think on some level, we're all friends. 
Do you socialize together outside of work? 
Do you exchange gifts? 
Do you vacation together on nonjudgmental cruise lines? 
Well, no, but... 
Listen, girlfriend. 
You're trying to solve an emotional problem, but what you have is a money problem. 
You want to be "friends" with people like Tracy Jordan and Jenna Maroney? 
They're rich, so show me the money. 
How much do you make? 
I'm not sure. 
My church requires a 110% tithe. 
 How old are you? 
 Don't worry about it. 
How much have you saved? 
Are you talking about saving squirrels from hawks? 
Zero. 
If you really want to be friends with people this, you are going to have to quit the page program, and get a real job so that you can earn for your future. 
What? 
No, I can't quit the page program. 
Well then, denied! 
You got the initiative. 
How do you keep it? 
By making a second first impression. 
You're going to wear dark colors, with a single power accent. 
Every hair in place. 
Hair movement... 
Is a sign of weakness. 
And whatever you do, don't speak first. 
90% of negotiations are lost by the person who speaks first. 
Because what is speaking a sign of? 
Weakness? 
You, out. 
Fired. 
Oh! 
I hate those shoes. 
Oh, are we starting? 
Please. 
All right. 
Let's start with salary. 
What are you doing? 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
Are you on some subconscious level seeing this as me toying with your manhood? 
Of course I am. 
I invented that. 
Boca 2002... 
You've seen the tapes? 
What? No. 
I-I just... 
You are being coached by me. 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
I have to take this. 
Yes, may I please speak to pizza? 
The fake phone call to buy time in an emergency? 
Classic Donaghy. 
Okay, fine. 
You got me. 
Game over. 
No, no. 
This just levels the playing field. 
Going mano a mano against a real adversary, me... 
It's the ultimate game. 
Jack Donaghy... 
Playing with himself. 
It's a Jack-off. 
Well, great job. 
Adam locked himself in the bathroom. 
If we can get him out of there, you two have got to do better than that pathetic butchering of Who's on first?. 
"Who's on first"! 
That's the phrase I couldn't remember. 
What's going on here? 
I think we're waiting. 
I'm confused. 
We make other people wait. 
Forcing people to wait, throwing things, making crazy demands and never being satisfied... 
Adam's acting like us. 
But he's not famous. 
Why is the government allowing this? 
Because today, he's the star. 
A Jewish star. 
If we don't make Adam happy, his dad is going to tell the IRS my house isn't a church, although I do let children drink wine there. 
Tracy, as fellow stars, we may actually be able to solve Adam's problem. 
I mean, when we're acting out, what makes us happy? 
When I'm acting out, it's never about the real problem. 
Like all actors, I'm not emotionally mature enough to deal with my feelings, you fart-face. 
I know you are, but what am I? 
Adam isn't upset about us. 
It's something else. 
We just have to find out what it is and save this Bar Mitzvah. 
So you've lost the initiative, perhaps by being a woman or a shorter man, but you can regain it by fighting on your home turf. 
No one has ever won a land war in Russia. 
Not Napoleon, not Hitler, not even Balki in the unaired ninth season of Perfect strangers. 
So where's your Russia? 
What's your home turf? 
The one place in the world where you cannot lose. 
Ice cream store. 
What are you doing? 
This is the men's room, Jenna. 
Not the C-list skank's room. 
That's solid, but that's not why we're here. 
Adam, we want to help. 
You're the star today. 
And we know how hard that can be. 
Look, we know you're not really mad about us. 
You acting out is about something else. 
You can tell us. 
We're in S.A.G. 
It's just... 
Everyone expects me to dance with a girl today. 
And I don't know about girls. 
I mean, I've played this Japanese video game where you slap prostitutes to death, but you only ever dance with this penguin named Yamagiku. 
Adam, trust me. 
Any girl would want to dance with you. 
You're rich. 
And you're fat, so you'll die young. 
Women love that. 
Ad-rock, I'm going to tell you the same thing I tell my son. 
Put money in the girl's mouth. 
Also, my friend, Darryl, is your real father. 
Now you go get 'em. 
Hazel, why does my coffee order say "the black one" on it? 
Uh... 
Did you put peanuts on this? 
Yeah, it's delicious, hat guy. 
Ah... 
I'm allergic! 
Damn it! 
I have to write a 40-word exit evaluation of Kenneth! 
I wish I was dead! 
Okay, Kenneth. 
You win. 
Please come back. 
Okay. 
When is my birthday? 
I don't know. 
When is that party you throw that we never go to 'cause we don't know what to get the man who has nothing. 
Suze Orman was right. 
I need to quit the page program and get a real job. 
You know what we did today? 
An amazing rendition of "What's the guy's name who plays first base?" 
No, we solved a problem by just addressing it, head on. 
Tracy, what if you and I dealt with all of our problems that way? 
What if we were honest at work about what's bothering us? 
That would make everyone's lives a whole lot better. 
Like the polio vaccine. 
Or a no-bottom strip club near a Wendy's. 
Let's do it, J-Mo. 
Hey, Jack. 
Sorry I'm so late. 
You're not. 
I changed the clock on your phone. 
I just got here. 
Anyway, I really appreciate you coming to my neighborhood, my home turf, if you will. 
I see. 
Well played, Jack. 
You anticipated my counter move, employing "A shortness is weakness" power axiom. 
However, I knew that you might know that I knew to bring my own furniture, so I also brought my Jack Welch power pillow. 
I'm very sorry, sir. 
I thought you might do that, which is why I'm going to be the first person to do power quiet talking, forcing you to lean in and wonder if you're missing any key phrases. 
Like an idiot. 
I thought you'd try power quiet talking, which is why I'm wearing a hearing aid. 
Stalemate. 
I'm everything I hoped I'd be. 
Let's begin. 
2% raise, a show on Christmas, no gross merchandising, and you have a run in your stocking. 
8% raise, two weeks off at Christmas, 5% gross, and nice try. 
I'm not wearing stockings. 
That's a vein. 
No raise, no vacation, and from now on, you have to say, "go for Liz," when you answer your phone. 
Um, hold on a sec. 
Come on, Lemon. 
I'm just doing the sorcerer's apprentice. 
You respond with a pirate holiday, and I have no choice but to play the hillbilly auction. 
It's all on the tapes. 
Ah, forget it. 
This is taking too long. 
I'll do both sides. 
If you think I won't do the show without Lemon, think again. 
Oh, Jack, you're bluffing. 
Liz, we're out of here. 
If you walk out that door, you'll burn every bridge she has here. 
It'll be back to submitting topical menopause jokes to joy behar by fax. 
Oh, please. 
You'd be in breach. 
You'd have more lawyers on you than a midtown hooker. 
You're all talk. 
It's like that time you said you'd hit on Carla Bruni in front of Sarkozy, and you totally backed down. 
So did you. 
Sorry, I have to take this. 
Hello? 
It's me. Nice try. 
I'm writing down a number. 
Oh! You're dreaming. 
Then I'd counter. 
I'd reject that. 
Then an elegante, parry with an elegante primo, 5%, I demand three years... 
No, that can't be right. 
Elegante, elegante primo, carry the one... 
Good God. 
 What? 
 You won. 
I did? 
You got everything you wanted. 
Kabletown Jack made a mistake, and Lemon Jack pounced on it. 
I-me lost. 
Yes! 
I won! 
Nobody beats the Liz! 
Oh, sorry. 
In your face. 
Mr. Hornberger. 
I got the message about the good-bye Kenneth brunch. 
I can't tell you how touched... 
Yeah, that was a lie. 
But look who's here? 
 Double actor announcement. 
 Double actor announcement. 
Over the years, we've wasted a lot of time complaining about things other than what's really bothering us. 
From now on, Tracy and I are going to be more "haw-naist." 
Instead of just throwing tantrums, we're going to talk things through. 
Who's that lady? 
It's her fault that it's cold in here! 
Tracy... 
Be honest. 
It's not about the air-conditioning, is it? 
Okay. 
It's just that I see a new page, and I'm not used to change. 
Because I was raised in foster care. 
Sounds like Tracy's missing someone. 
He's missing me. 
Boy, you are dumb sometimes. 
Tracy, this new page is Hazel, Kenneth's replacement. 
Kenneth wants to leave the page program so he can go make more money. 
But you need him here, don't you? 
Yes, I do need you, Kenneth. 
I depend on you. 
But I'm telling you to go, because now that I'm being honest, this job is a dead end for you. 
And it would be selfish of me to make you stay. 
Are you serious? 
Yes. 
Now go. 
Run, Kenneth. 
Run before I change my mind. 
Run, Kenneth! 
Run! 
Hey, your video says that after a negotiation, the winner should get the loser a gift. 
So I brought you this popcorn tin. 
There's no popcorn left, but it makes a great closet organizer. 
Socks, underwear, bras. 
I used to be a winner. 
Men wanted to be me, women wanted to sleep with me, bisexuals wanted to watch. 
Now look at me. 
A meaningless job, I can't get my wife back. 
What's the point? 
Maybe I'll just quit and... 
Go work for a not-for-profit. 
Somewhere where there's less pressure and the people are nice. 
And I can wear sneakers and jeans on Friday. 
No, Jack, stop. 
It's okay. 
I hate myself. 
I want to be somebody else! 
I want to be a baby again! 
No, no, no. 
Look, you won. 
I'll sign whatever. 
Just don't cry. 
Daddy doesn't cry. 
I don't need gross merchandising. 
Excellent. 
What? 
What are you doing? 
 Proving I could win. 
 God! 
You were freaking me out. 
Exactly. 
Do you know why I lost earlier? 
Because of our friendship. 
I want you to have everything. 
And that made me make a mistake. 
In other words, I lost because of emotion, which I always thought was a weakness, but now I've learned it can also be a weapon. 
You didn't realize emotion could be a weapon? 
Have you not read the poetry of jewel? 
The point is, you had Liz's Jack on your side. 
And that's why he-me beat Kabletown Jack, until me-I turned the tables on you-you. 
So that means that my me-I taught your you-you a negotiation trick. 
Yes, I suppose you did. 
Wow. 
After six years, there's still room for growth in this friendship. 
What... why are you 
signing that? 
You won? 
Lemon, I wanted to know I could win. 
I'm still going to take care of you. 
Excuse me, sirs. 
Mr. Donaghy, 
do you remember the other day when you said there are other opportunities for me at the company? 
Of course. 
Well, I would like to discuss those opportunities with you further. 
Because I am quitting the page program. 
But you have no other skills. 
He's a white male with hair, Lemon. 
The sky's the limit. 
Liz: To white men! 
Adam, we hear you're a Yankees fan. 
Tracy, aren't you a coach for the Yankees? 
You must know all the players. 
Oh, sure. 
Those players have some crazy names. 
Like Derek and Alex. 
Who's on first? 
Uh-oh, we're going to get confused. 
The guy who plays first is who? 
No, thank you. 
I mean the fellow's name. 
 Everybody. 
 The guy on first. 
His wife's name is don't. 
What's the guy's name on first base? 
Know what died in Vietnam. 
I'm not asking you who's on second. 
Let's just agree to disagree. 
 Fourth base! 
 Fourth base! 
﻿1 Liz! 
Liz Lemon! 
It's me, Thad. 
From college. 
I've had my skin tags removed since then so you can see my eyes now. 
Oh, you ran the light board at the theater. 
Everyone called you... Thad, 
no nickname. 
And you, you were the star The Sound of Music. 
Thank you, no everyone thinks of the young Nazi boy as the star of that show. 
 You are one age going on another age   what's going to happen next. 
A lot of people didn't realize that was the free, unlicensed version. 
Look, I know it's last minute, but I'm having an epic Leap Day party this afternoon. 
Wow, a daytime party celebrating Leap Day. 
Sounds fun, but I have to work. 
Hey, Liz, new Bluetooth? 
No, I'm talking to someone. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
I don't see people that look like that. 
Sorry. 
Wow, that was this creep I went to college with. 
Such a nerd. 
And this is coming from someone who wrote lyrics to the song the cantina band playsin Star Wars. 
 Figrin d'an the kloo horn man   he's from clak'dor seven But, at least I don't throw Leap Day parties. 
Wait, that was Thad Warmald, the billionaire? 
No, that was sad Thad the skintag lad. 
I coined that. 
That name has been all over the gold digger message boards lately. 
I don't know a lot about business, but he did an Internet and now the computers like him and Wall Street is Google. 
Oh, my God. 
We are going to this party and you're introducing me to Thad. 
Liz, I'm on a sexual walkabout right now. 
I need to know if anything can make me happier than being with Paul. 
And maybe $20 billion would do it. 
What? How much 
Internet did he do? 
Poke your eye, pull your hair, you forgot what clothes to wear. 
What the hell? 
You're not wearing yellow and blue on Leap Day. 
So what? 
Leap Day is not a thing. 
 Leap Day William  Leap Day William  bursting from the sea  will he bring his bucket of sweets for mom and pop and me  What the crap is going on in here? 
Why, Leap Day William is visiting. 
Leap Day William? 
Miss Lemon, did you not grow up with Leap Day William? 
He lives in the Mariana trench. 
He emerges every four years to trade children's tears for candy? 
What? No. 
But white haven was founded by the amish, and we really only celebrated their holidays. 
After high school, I went on rumspringa. 
It was crazy. 
I totally snuck into The Witches of Eastwick. 
But where were you when we did this four years ago? 
Certainly not at a Michael's crafts crafting cruise. 
Oh, miss Lemon, you are missing out. 
Every four years, you get a magical extra day. 
A day to do the things you ordinarily wouldn't do. 
To take chances! 
For instance, I am wearing a braided necklace with a shark's tooth on it. 
I listened to rap music for the first time. 
Not a fan. 
And you and I are going to a party thrown by a billionaire. 
Come on, take a leap, Liz. 
Okay, fine, I'll go, but if he has a giant chandelier in his house, I'm out. 
Those things fall. 
Waah, waah. 
 Leap Day William, Leap Day William  30 ROCK S06 Ep09 - Leap Day Happy Leap Day, Lemon. 
 Help yourself to some rhubarb. 
 Rhubarb? 
Is white haven the only city in America that doesn't celebrate Leap Day? 
Oh, it's not such a big deal in Boston, either. 
Just a Leap Day William parade, citywide ice maze and, uh, we don't poke you in the eye if you're not wearing yellow and blue. 
 We just, uh, stomp on your foot. 
 Ow! 
Kick you in the knee, Yankees suck, go pats. 
I can't believe the woman who watches all six pawn shop reality shows has never seen the movie, Leap Dave Williams. 
I'm sorry, is Leap Dave Williams a play on Leap Day William? 
It's a classic. 
Uptight lawyer Dave Williams turns into the real Leap Day William after an ice fishing trip gone awry. 
USA runs an all day marathon. 
Dave, is everything all right? 
I definitely don't have gills. 
I mean, nothing. 
I mean, yes. 
Oh, my God, that's what Chris kept quoting this morning during our love... making. 
New assistant reporting for duty. 
Kenneth's filling in. 
Gabe's got the weak off. 
He's a mormon. 
You know how they are about Leap Day. 
No, I don't, I don't know th... 
Ow, ah! 
Fine, I didn't wanna have to do this, but I am wearing yellow and blue. 
Kenneth, I'm hoping to find you a permanent position here at the company, but it's hard to take you seriously when you're dressed like that. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
I just get so excited spreading holiday cheer. 
Well, certainly you remember the joy that fills a young boy's heart on the day of leap. 
Don't get me wrong, I love this holiday. 
But do you know why? 
Oh, sir, I never know why. 
Because it's an extra day to do business. 
A bonus profit opportunity. 
I have a bet with my business school roommates every four years to see who can make the most money on Leap Day. 
And that is why I am announcing today that cable town is purchasing Xaro, the 3-D Internet company. 
It'll be like those Bible quotes are right in your face. 
Yes, now take off that bald cap, Kenneth. 
We have a lot of work to do. 
Of course, take off my bald cap. 
Not put on my wig. 
Well, he's definitely rich. 
Oh... 
Look how lame this crowd is. 
Thad's been in his little nerd world for so long and now he's peeping out of his shell like a... um, 
oh, what's that animal? 
You know, the one that crosses so slowly across the road and then you swerve to make sure you hit it and then a car coming the other way swerves to avoid you and goes off a cliff. 
And then that night you and your companion have the greatest sex of your lives because you're both sharing a secret. 
 It's a turtle, Jenna. 
 Yes, he's a turtle. 
And he's coming out of his shell for the first time. 
And when he does, he's gonna see this. 
We really gotta get all the furniture out of here? 
My aquarium guy's coming to see about turning this whole room into an aquarium. 
Begging the question: Who's really in the aquarium? 
The fish or us? 
Greetings, coworkers. 
Uh, Mr. Donaghy would 
like to inform you that, "unfortunately due to the Obama worldwide recession, "there will be no Leap Day bonuses this year. 
"Mean laughter, sound of a drink being poured. 
"What are you writing now, you slack-jawed donkey? 
What are all these letters, tray? 
It's just fan mail. 
I mean, would you read a bunch of letters from people who look up to me? 
A $50,000 benihana gift card? 
Oh, right, I did an ad and insisted on being paid in beni bucks. 
Oh, no sir, this card is only good through February 2012. 
Any other year it'd be march already. 
But we found it today! 
It's a Leap Day miracle! 
Gentlemen, we have one day to eat $50,000 worth of Japanese food. 
That's impossible. 
Nothing's impossible on Leap Day. 
It's like I said in my cameo appearance in Leap Dave Williams, "gimme your wallet, old man!" 
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce you to the future of Kabletown, the future of web-browsing, and, quite frankly, the future. 
Welcome to the age of 3-D Internet. 
Following an unintentionally racist press conference... 
Help us to "Whip" the competition. 
Kabletown shares down sharply... 
Careful, sir, those leaves are poisonous. 
You know the saying, "rhubarb red, eat away, rhubarb green, don't eat them." 
Kenneth, I've watched newt gingrich eat a plate of ribs. 
I think my stomach can handle some rhubarb leaves. 
Do you have any idea how long you'll be needing me today? 
One of my birds is sick and I want to get home in time to baptize her. 
We're both staying here until I come up with an idea to turn this day around. 
Now, would you watch a television show... 
And I'm just spitballing here... 
Called spitball? 
Sir, Rebecca Birdstein needs me. 
Kenneth, we all have to make sacrifices. 
Watch this. 
Sherry, I'm afraid something has come up at work and you'll have to stay late with Liddy. 
Uh, just dab some scotch on your neck and make your eyes the color of a winter crystal so she'll think you're me. 
Uh, thank you Sherry. 
Good night. 
How many rooms are in... 
It's my, uh, d&d room. 
The gaming table comes up out of the floor. 
Table! 
Frak, I'm supposed to say "floor" first. 
splintering] Forget it, damn it! 
 This is all for you, Liz. 
 What? 
I have been in love with you since college. 
Watching you every night on that stage and realizing my dad was wrong. 
I do like girls. 
Oh, boy. Okay. 
The party, the New York apartment, everything. 
Do you know why I spun off Xaro and sold it to Kabletown? 
Just so I could accidentally run into you. 
That is why it's called Xaro. 
In Game of Thrones, Xaro is a rich merchant prince who wishes to acquaint himself with the mother of dragons. 
Great, well... Scooby Doo! 
Liz, wait! 
$10 million! 
I want you to take my virginity on leap night for $10 million. 
Fine, 20. 
 No, Thad, I... 
 Don't answer yet. 
I mean, okay, unless you were gonna say yes. 
 No, you heard me say no. 
 Don't answer yet. 
Don't answer yet. 
Oh, come... ... on. 
Aah! 
Son of a glub. 
Mr. Jordan, you'll never 
spend all this by midnight. 
You appeared in that ad for nothing. 
Well the joke's on you because that commercial never aired for unexplained reasons. 
I just touched the table again. 
Oh, God, you call for help! 
I'll just put my head on the table for a second. 
Now let's get started, bring us a bottle of your finest wine. 
Of course, Mr. Jordan. 
That will be $12. 
Hey, Liz. 
I can't find Thad. 
Thad just indecentproposal-ed me. 
One night, $20 million. 
Oh, my God, that's the gold digger's dream. 
 Where is he? 
 No, Jenna. 
You don't understand. 
He's been in love with me since college. 
He only wants me. 
And you're still here. 
You're considering it. 
Liz, you know you're not doing this. 
I'm on a sexual walkabout. 
But you're a nice girl with a live-in boyfriend. 
Honey, I'm about to do something pretty... crazy. 
You should. 
It's Leap Day. 
Real life is for march. 
No, just hear me out. 
 Because if this doesn't work... 
 It doesn't matter. 
Nothing that happens on Leap Day counts. 
Nothing that happens on Leap Day counts. 
Well, then, here goes nothing. 
Aah! 
Hey, Liz, what's up? 
Criss, I'm about to do something pretty crazy. 
You should, it's Leap Day. 
 Real life is for march. 
 Oh, boy. 
No, hear me out, because this could really ruin... 
No, it doesn't matter. 
Nothing that happens on Leap Day counts. 
Hey, listen, I gotta run, but whatever it is, go for it. 
Oh, my. 
It looks like we've got a slut-off on our hands. 
We've only spent $6000. 
We should just give up. 
 Never. 
 We can't keep eating! 
Lutz's shirt button popped off and hit Cerie. 
It counts as us touching. 
This is important. 
Everybody's always telling me not to get paid in gift cards. 
Angie, my lawyer, my imaginary friend, Dotcom. 
Tray, I'm real. 
I moved your furniture. 
And, yeah, Leap Day has become too commercial. 
And people have forgotten what it really means, but I remember. 
One Leap Day when I was a kid, the Harlem River froze, and I decided to cross it carrying my brick collection. 
I told him not to. 
No one can hear you, Dotcom. 
Then I fell through the ice. 
They still don't know who pulled me out. 
I did. 
Charlie Rangel gave me a medal. 
I like to think it was Leap Day William. 
You really believe in Leap Day William? 
I used to. 
Then I tried to eat all this benihana. 
Now I don't know anymore. 
I gotta take a walk. 
Do some thinking. 
But I can explain. 
I'm Leap Day Williams! 
No, really! 
Please, believe me. 
Have a little faith. 
Oh, boy. 
I'm getting sleepy. 
Wow, you're famous. 
I have screen grabs of all your nip s. 
You know what, Thad? 
I was trying to remember. 
What was the dance that Rolf did for Liesl? 
Did it go like this? 
Oh, yes. 
That's it. 
That's how Rolf danced. 
Mmm. 
Why don't you go and get me and Liz some drinks? 
Very well. 
Liz, a moment, please? 
If you're really gonna do this, you better get a move on. 
Right now, there are models waking up from their coke binges, multi-ethnic bartenders with daddy issues, former ballerinas who had to quit because their boobs got too big. 
They're gonna hear about the horny billionaire, and Thad's gonna forget all about his little crush. 
They're coming Liz. 
Click click. 
That's their stilettos. 
Click click. 
Sir? 
Sir, you don't look so good. 
You shouldn't have eaten those rhubarb leaves. 
I can't be sick. 
I won't lose money on Leap Day. 
I'm just gonna rest a second. 
Please get better, sir. 
I've dug too many graves. 
Why the long face, son? 
I do have a long, elegant face, thank you, but I can't enjoy your compliment, because I'm sad. 
I'm starting to think Leap Day William isn't even real. 
I reckon you may be right. 
Leap Day William's probably just a tall tale told to kids to help sell candy. 
But this old fool still believes he exists, right here, inside all of us. 
I am always coughing up blood. 
Could that be Leap Day William trying to get out? 
Might could be, but I think if he were here right now, Leap Day William would tell you everything's gonna be all right, Tracy, as long as you remember where you come from. 
Thanks. 
Nice costume, by the way. 
Right, costume. 
So, what should we do now? 
Stop pressuring me. 
What are you? 
An intercourse monster? 
I'm sorry. 
I'm nervous. 
Is sex like when the Na'vi intertwine their hair braids? 
Sure. 
Yeah, Thad, that's exactly what it's like. 
Okay, look, if we're gonna do this, we kinda need to do it now, okay, before... 
Oh, no. 
Aw, damn it. 
Hot bitches. 
Wake up, sir! 
Wake up. 
What is this? 
Kenneth, is that me? 
Oh, I'm not Kenneth. 
I'm the spirit of Leap Day. 
Welcome to your Leap Day past. 
Jackie, we can't go to the parade today. 
I got called into work... at the 
hospital... where I'm a nurse. 
Why are you showing me this? 
This is the kind of adversity that made me the man I am today. 
Good. Cry. 
Let your sadness form a hole inside you that can only be filled with money. 
Of course we're going to the parade today, Jackie. 
But you can't have candy and cigarettes without a few tears first. 
How did I forget this part? 
And when did we stop giving children cigarettes? 
It's the liberal war on Leap Day. 
It's time to go, Mr. Donaghy. 
Welcome to Leap Day present. 
Okay, I'll change me eye color, but it seem like a waste of voodoo. 
Good night, Mr. Donaghy. 
Sorry, baby. 
Daddy not coming home tonight because of work. 
It's a good lesson. 
This will help her in life. 
Are you sure? 
Welcome to the future. 
Five leap days from now. 
That's Liddy. 
I assume this is her horse stable and that she's hammering that nail as a funny joke. 
No, Mr. Donaghy. 
She's doing habitat for humanity. 
After you missed all her leap days, she started experimenting with liberalism. 
That's not her. 
It can't be. 
What have you done with my daughter? 
Where is Liddy? 
She's at home, sir. 
With the nanny. 
There's still time. 
Kenneth, I want you to go to citarella and buy the biggest rhubarb there is. 
The one that's as big as me, sir? 
That's the one. 
But first, you take Rebecca Birdstein to the vet. 
What a Mitzvah. 
Merry Leap Day, sir. 
Merry Leap Day to us all! 
Liz, why don't you go and... 
Get you and Karolina some drinks? 
Okay, fine. 
Looks like this time the male will be in the Czech. 
That kind of wit is a thing she will never give you. 
Hey, Liz, a gym teacher on a sex tour of Indonesia called. 
He wants his shirt back. 
Okay, that's solid, Kurkova. 
That's a good burn. 
What was that old man trying to tell me? 
What am I gonna do with all this free food? 
Remember where I came from. 
But we all came from the sea. 
Sea? 
Like the letter "C", which is part of the alphabet. 
Alphabet soup. 
Soup kitchen. 
 Kitchen... 
 No, no, don't keep going. 
The kitchen debate with Richard Nixon. 
Richard M. Nixon. 
The M-train. 
Soul train. 
Chicken soup for the soul. 
Chicken soup. 
Soup kitchen. 
This is a Leap Day miracle! 
Merry Leap Day, tourists. 
Merry Leap Day, closeted gay guys meeting in the city. 
 God bless you on this Leap Day fair   a calm wind and the ocean air  Really? 
Seriously 20 million bucks? 
I would sleep with Thad Warmald for that. 
Couldn't go through with it. 
You know, I just kept seeing your face. 
Also, I have too much dignity. 
Mmm, so another woman? 
 Victoria's secret model. 
 Oh. 
Feast, homeless, feast! 
I saved Leap Day! 
And connected with my son! 
And I solved the big case from earlier! 
Merry Leap Day, everybody! 
Hey! 
Take a leap, pal! 
That's the spirit! 
 Leap Day magic's all around   as Leap Day William comes to town  Happy Leap Day, sweetheart. 
Yes! 
 He knows when you are bad or good   he knows when you're asleep   he knows... 
Oh, my God, behind you! 
Well, I guess we all learned something tonight about love and friendship, about taking chances, about the true meaning of Leap Day. 
But, these lessons aren't good just for every four years. 
No. They're good 
every year. 
Because we should live every day as if it's Leap Day, and every Leap Day as if it's your last. 
Oh, and if you should ever see an old man in a blue suit busting out of the middle of the ocean, take the time to say howdy. 
It might just be worth your while. 
﻿1 Say you approve of Criss. 
I'm in your head. 
Why did you have to offend the gay community? 
Did you just call me an idiot on this TV? 
Tracy has organized a protest of NBC by his fellow idiots. 
Mr. Hornberger? 
 What do we do? 
 I don't know. 
But I know someone who does. 
Talk to me. 
They're still mad? 
We sent Elton and David a honey-baked ham. 
What more do they want? 
I'm joined now by one gay rights advocate who isn't sure Jordan and NBC have learned their lesson. 
Devin Banks, welcome. 
Thank you, Dallas. 
I have seen you since Michael Kors' new year's Eve masquerade. 
Uh, I don't know what you're talking about. 
Right. Let's dive in. 
Banks. 
Hey, try this. New recipe. 
We have to talk. 
How fresh is that dog? 
Yesterday, that was the face, feet and colon of a pig. 
I'm so fired up, Liz. 
I got some cash now. 
I can finally make a down payment on a real food truck. 
Yeah, the van's not great. 
All right, kids. 
Who wants some? 
Get in my van. 
Is there a problem, officer? 
But you can't take that money. 
What, why not? 
Because the guy who wrote you the check... 
He's my boss and he doesn't really care about the hot dog truck or locally sourced pig sweepings. 
He just needed an excuse to meet you. 
Wait a minute, you know Jack? 
Why would he want to pay $10,000 to meet me? 
Because I didn't want him to meet you. 
He inserts himself into my business whether I want him to or not and now he's inserting himself into this. 
Well, that's what she said, but... 
Why wouldn't you want him to meet me? 
You're embarrassed of me? 
No, it's not me, it's him. 
I didn't want him to lecture me about how you don't have a job and your name is spelled wrong and you went to Wesleyan. 
Wesleyan is the Harvard of central Connecticut. 
Yale is the Harvard of central Connecticut. 
Had that locked and loaded, didn't you? 
Well, you know what? 
This isn't a Jack problem. 
I think this is a Liz problem. 
Because you wouldn't care what he thought unless you agreed with him. 
Like you're so perfect. 
Let's not do this. 
You don't say cholesterol correctly. 
"Chloresterole." 
You're a 41 year old woman who cheats at board games. 
You don't use the tab closures on cereal boxes. 
If you think those are doing anything to seal in freshness, you are living in a fantasy world, pal. 
Forget it. 
This was a good day, Liz. 
I'm gonna be in the park meditating. 
What would Jack say about that? 
He'd say, "good God, Lemon." 
Locked and loaded. 
Good God, Lemon. 
30 ROCK Ep 03 - Idiots Are People Three I'll have you know the last man who wore jeans in this office was named Theodore Wrangler. 
And you, Banks, could not even carry his trademark, floor-length, suede cape. 
I was wondering when I'd hear from you, Jack. 
Do you know what comes up on my phone when you call? 
Where did you get that? 
The only copy of that photograph is in Stephanie Seymour's safety deposit box. 
You have bigger things to worry about, Jack. 
See, I've got you right where I want you. 
Really? 
You think you have leverage here? 
The news cycle is done with Tracy. 
They've moved on to a story about teenagers huffing other teenagers. 
Tracy's apologies have been accepted by GLAAD and I don't even know what organization you're here representing. 
We're new, we're called PEEN. 
And what is that an acronym for? 
Acronym? 
Okay, you've succeeded in annoying me and wasting my time. 
But your 15 minutes is up. 
And...you've got nothing. 
Really? 
Nothing? 
See that little Tracy Jordan gem that I leaked last night was just the tip of the iceberg, Jack. 
And NBC is the Titanic. 
The highest grossing movie of all time! 
The boat, not the movie, the boat! 
See, I've been following Tracy's standup act for months now and if any of this gets out, every protected group in America's gonna be picketing this network. 
Enjoy. 
Good God. 
Oh, is this one about how asians act on the subway? 
I know, I almost threw up the first time I heard it. 
Oh, this one's fun. 
Starts out as a joke about our first Mexican President. 
My Lord. 
And ends up as just a rant against women. 
Oh... 
No one can ever listen to this. 
Then she had teeth down there! 
What do you want, money? 
A job? 
This isn't a business play, Jack. 
I mean, what's the point. 
After going head to head with you for the last five years, I've ended up as a house husband in Brooklyn. 
You won, Jack. 
So what are you saying? 
I've given up trying to beat you in the board room. 
But there are still things I can make you do. 
All right, you can watch me shower, but no touching. 
No touching just makes it hotter. 
No, I'm after bigger game than you. 
See you're a very influential man, Donaghy. 
You can pull strings in the kind of venerable institutions that still reject creeps like me. 
I want you to get my triplets into preschool... 
At St. Matthew's. 
Banks, that's impossible. 
Just last year, they rejected one of St. Matthew's 
actual descendents. 
I know. 
I head that during her interview she turned the class hamster into a dove. 
Good luck. 
Pick up the Mercury with the tape, bag it, then seal the bags. 
We'll drive everything out to the meadowlands and roll the car into a swamp. 
We should take two cars. 
You didn't tell me he was alive! 
Well of course he is. 
Pete's our friend, Kelsey. 
Damn it! 
No names! 
We don't want him to die. 
But more importantly, we don't want to be blamed for what's happened to him. 
It's been five hours since he's pressed an elevator button. 
His office is on this floor, isn't it? 
Yes, but to get him there, you have to go through the backstage and the backstage is full of people. 
We need a distraction. 
Something to clear the halls of TGS. 
How much time will Kenneth and I have? 
How long is the show? 
I don't know. 
I've never done it before, baby. 
I will make a brief statement on behalf of the idiot community, then I will open the floor for questions. 
Since its founding early this afternoon, the national association for zero intolerance, or Nazi... 
 We should change that. 
 It's fine. 
We are outraged that the American bigot, Liz Lemon, has made no effort to reach out to us. 
Tracy, are you kidding me? 
I have been calling your cell all day. 
My ringtone is the chicken dance. 
If I answer it, I won't hear the whole song! 
I have to go talk to Jack right now. 
Wait for me in my office. 
Is there anything you would like to add? 
These microphones look like black ice cream cones. 
Thank you all for coming out. 
Jack, I am giving you your money back. 
You can't tear up my checks, Criss. 
They're printed on Nixon's old bed sheets. 
Look, I don't understand your relationship with Liz. 
She's my subordifriend. 
Well, she's my girlfriend and I'm not gonna let you get in between us. 
It's a little late for that. 
You're not going to want to hear this, but I am officially disapproving of you. 
Well, I'm sorry, but I really don't care what you think. 
That's really not how things work around here, Criss. 
Damn it, Criss, stop talking to him, it's a trap! 
You said I won. 
You said you wouldn't ask any more questions about Criss. 
I said I wouldn't ask you any more questions. 
Semantics! 
You had no right to come to my home to trick Criss to rearrange my bathroom. 
 For the better. 
 Yes. 
The basket of shells was a nice touch. 
But, I'm afraid I have bad news. 
I just told Criss that I am officially disapproving. 
 Oh, no. 
 Who cares? 
Of course, you're free to make your own decisions, Lemon. 
You can either pretend that you and I are not in agreement and continue this, uh... 
charade. 
Or you can part ways with Criss now and go and find someone who will truly make you happy. 
I'm sorry, is this guy breaking up with me? 
Of course, you and Criss can still be friends. 
Okay, Liz, I guess you got a choice to make. 
You can listen to Jack, we can call it quits and I go back to sleeping on the floor of my Uncle's mattress store, or... 
You don't understand. 
He's in my head. 
Okay, forget Jack. 
What does Liz think, hmm? 
What do you want? 
Do you want to be with me or not? 
Don't look at me, ask her. 
I don't know, Liz. 
It's gonna go wrong eventually, right? 
I mean, I like him, but, what are we doing here? 
Really? 
This is how you see yourself? 
Of course I pick you, Criss. 
If you would just address some of the issues that we as a group have been talking about. 
Unbelievable. 
Well, I have to go get a bunch of gaybies into preschool before we all get sued, so, uh... 
Well done, Lemon. 
So, then he says "Tiff down there"... 
Good one, Jack. 
I'll tell you, friendship is the one kind of ship that never sinks. 
Douglas, so good to see you. 
Uh, do you know my friend, Devin Banks? 
A friend of Donaghy's, eh? 
I'll watch my wallet. 
Yes, yes, very good, Douglas. 
Very funny. 
So now we're all good friends and good friends do favors for each other. 
Is that a St. Matthew's tie? 
I didn't know you went there. 
Not only did I go there, I happen to be President of the board. 
Although, during my financial report I may be President of the bored. 
St. Matthew's is such a 
wonderful school. 
We were just talking about that. 
In fact, Devin's triplets are applying to St. Matthew's 
right now. 
I see... 
Splendid. 
On a totally unrelated topic, did you know that I'm also on the board of the Manhattan hospital for rich whites and assimilated Jews? 
I did not know that. 
Unfortunately, shortly before Don Geiss died, the Geiss foundation made a sizeable pledge to the hospital. 
A pledge which, sadly, has not been fulfilled. 
What a coincidence because Devin and I happen to know the new chair of the Geiss foundation quite well. 
That is a coincidence. 
Kathy, are you ready to come out now? 
There she is. 
Hey, you. 
Hey, funny. 
Kathy, I know this is a lot to take in but, your father made a promise to my friend, so, what can we do to get that check right now? 
And that's why I'm so thrilled to introduce NBC's new mascot, Magellica the Unicorn. 
It's wondrous. 
Indeed. 
Back to you, Thomas. 
Okay...we now return 
to our coverage of that train derailment in California. 
And idiots can do anything we put our minds to. 
I played a "nucular" psychiatrist in a James "Bong" movie. 
Look, what do I need to do to make this go away? 
I want you to call my phone so I can hear the chicken dance again. 
And I want the video for my new single to play on TGS this week. 
 La piscine  j'adore la piscine  towels sunscreen bathing suits   diving boards and towels  those ladders  towels Can you make it 16 minutes long? 
We're short this week. 
I'll try to cut it down. 
But above all, we want you to recognize who we are as a community. 
Idiots aren't just strippers or stay at home moms. 
Idiots are all around us. 
I couldn't find a Lincoln hat so I grabbed this chimney sweep hat instead. 
If anyone notices... 
We're dead. 
So it would mean a lot if you apologized publically, Liz Lemon. 
Let the healing begin. 
And since you wrote my apology, we went on ahead and wrote yours. 
Careful. 
Careful. 
Who designed your bathroom? 
It's exquisite. 
I did, you son of a bitch. 
I'm excellent at rearranging bathrooms. 
Now get out of here, you got what you wanted. 
I just wanted to say thank you, Jack. 
Very impressive. 
Can't imagine that your boss, Hank Cooper, was all that happy about the logo change. 
Eh, we'll see. 
Our new slogan, "NBC, we have a magical horse?" 
Is testing, uh...Okay. 
Oh, I also wanted to say that I was lying when I said that this wasn't a business play. 
Banks, you're out of the game. 
That's true. 
And I've admitted defeat. 
For our generation. 
But for the next generation? 
Well, thanks to you, the Banks boys are way ahead. 
All the favors that you called in, you would have used next year for little lippy. 
Liddy. 
Is that even a name? 
In Brooklyn, I know, like, six lippys... 
Doesn't matter. 
You just mortgaged your daughter's future to get out of a little jam at work. 
My mommy and me group would really judge your parenting. 
Especially lippy's mother. 
Which lippy? 
Lippy D. 
Oh, God, Liddy might have to go to public school. 
See you in 30 years, Jack. 
I wonder what Liddy will be doing with her degree from suny. 
Don't even say it. 
Oneonta. 
You, jacket. 
Well, hello there, welcome to the White House. 
Four score and seven years ago... 
What's with that hat? 
 Oh, I think it looks very authentic. 
Yeah, I guess you're right. 
Mary Todd, you say? 
Wha... what's happening? 
Shh, Pete, don't talk. 
Wassup?! 
Yeah, baby! 
I'm here today to apologize for my earlier comments. 
I used an offensive term to describe a group of people who made America the great... 
continent that it is today. 
Yeah! 
These kickass people have given the world countless bodacious things like the birther movement, intelligent design... 
Water parks... no, I will not 
endorse water parks. 
They are a cesspool of disease and people boo you when you walk back down the stairs. 
You know what you people have given the world? 
Girls gone wild. 
The Golden Globes, cans that tell you how cold beer is, Florida, bratz dolls. 
Oh, I get it. 
She's naming awesome things. 
No, listen to me. 
Because of you, there may be an entouragemovie. 
Hug it off, ma'am! 
Turtle, turtle, turtle! 
You know what, I give up. 
You should know better, but no. 
You're just gonna keep on riding motorcycles, having unprotected sex and voting against free health care. 
You will make the same self-destructive decisions over and over and you will never really be happy. 
And your jaw will hurt all the time. 
Oh, look at you. 
Perfect little weiner dog, you just need a little mustard on you like that. 
And a little bun, just boop, like that. 
No one will make you deutschepancakes, or welcome you home smelling of hot dog water and onion, or let you break out of jail when you play monopoly. 
Oh, my God, I'm such an idiot. 
Wanna make out? 
No, thank you. 
Hot crowd, hot crowd. 
We've only got a minute before I have to get back out there. 
Act two is a play within a play. 
It's funny, in school all you learn about Abraham Lincoln is that he was a gay alcoholic. 
Grab his feet. 
Kelsey Gram... 
Shh, shh, shh. 
There, there, there you go. 
Okay, okay. 
I've gotta get back into character. 
Hit me in the face! 
What... I forgot to 
press a floor again. 
Hey, what's up, Jackie d? 
In a lot of ways, you and I had similar upbringings. 
Terrible schools, broken homes... 
Thinking basketball was the ticket out. 
Being wrong. 
At some point, our paths diverged. 
I went on to Princeton, business school, ge and beyond. 
And look at me. 
I spent all day creating a movement just to get back at Liz Lemon. 
I said creating a movement. 
The point is that excellence can come from anywhere. 
It's the same with stupidity. 
In this country, anyone could be the next Jack Donaghy or the next Denise Richards. 
This room... 
Is moving. 
Oh, God. 
Banks. 
What are you still doing here? 
Well, my husband was supposed to pick me up at 6:00 but he can be such an idiot. 
I'm sure he can. 
Where did you go to school, Devin? 
I had the best education in the world. 
Private kindergarten where I got straight check marks. 
Experimental boarding school in carmel where the students teach the teachers, and the teachers teach animals. 
Year abroad on an all-male catamaran. 
Then on to Northwestern where I majored in confidence. 
I had every educational advantage, Jack. 
Just like my children will. 
But I beat you. 
What? 
I beat you. 
I came from nothing. 
But I caught up and I crushed you. 
Just like Liddy's gonna crush your sons. 
She's already sorting objects by shape and color. 
At 11 months, I don't think so. 
She can count to ten if you say seven for her. 
She gets five and nine? 
 She can save five words. 
 So. 
In mandarin. 
They've put her with the toddlers at her singing and clapping class at fun factory. 
She's in Orange group? 
She's already out of the piaget sensorimotor stage. 
That's impossible. 
She scored a 62 on the object permanence matrix. 
But that's an adult score. 
And did I mention... 
She's using the potty. 
Surely just for wee-wee. 
No. 
See you in 30 years, Banks. 
It's already, like, turning itself. 
But I feel like I still have to turn it. 
Oh, oh, my God, mustard just came out my nose. 
Oh, it's burning the backs of my eyes. 
All right, I gotta go back to work, bye. 
Okay, all right. 
Ah, it's burning my face now. 
All right, I'm putting you on probationary approval. 
Okay, I don't really care. 
I'll tell you what changed my mind, Criss: a conversation I had with Tracy Jordan. 
You see, greatness can come from anywhere. 
So if a poor boy from Boston can become me, maybe you could become a suitable sex partner for Liz Lemon. 
You've got three months. 
But your opinion doesn't matter. 
You have no say in this. 
Liz, there's something wrong with Pete. 
Oh, my God! 
I don't know what happened. 
Pete, I have been out there putting out fires all day while you've been hiding in here doing this? 
You're disgusting. 
No, no, I was... I didn't... I... 
Kelsey Grammer! 
Kelsey Grammer did this to me. 
Really, Pete? 
Kelsey Grammer made you do this while he was performing his one man show about Abraham Lincoln? 
Ugh. 
Here's to another successful operation by... 
The best friends gang. 
Hang on. 
I didn't notice before with all the excitement, but... 
I look incredibly beautiful. 
The lighting is back to normal. 
Both switches need to be on, woman. 
The bulb wasn't even broken? 
None of this was necessary. 
I know... 
I've been successfully assassinated. 
But I have one last thing to tell my country. 
Blackbeard's gold is buried in... 
I am a ghost now, Leaving behind my earthly possessions. 
And although I left my country divided by war, A civil war... 
So that's where that name came from. 
I know that future generations will forge a stronger country And that some day, America will be a place Where everybody knows your name. 
﻿1 I finished my Kabletown self evaluation! 
Nailed it. 
"My greatest weakness is humility. 
I'm probably the most humble person in the whole world." 
I wrote that. 
These self-evaluations are a charade. 
People cannot be impartial about themselves. 
You should read what some of your coworkers wrote. 
What three words best describe me? 
The. Complete. Package. 
My greatest weakness... 
Is chocolate. 
Surprisingly the only person who was honest was Jenna. 
"Strengths: None. 
"I am the worst person I know. 
"When I used to live with Liz, I would videotape her sleeping and sell it to Japanese businessmen"? 
No wonder that tour group kept calling me "sleep whore-San." 
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
Don't read that. 
I filled it out last night after mixing alcohol with prescription... exhaustion. 
I need to redo it. 
I can't believe I have to read all of these. 
This is the biggest waste of time since NBC's diversity writing program. 
That was a good idea, but all of our actors are so white. 
Slap it to me, Daddy-O. 
Popo popped dookie down by the vacants. 
  30 ROCK S06 Ep16 - Nothing left to lose This is Jenna. 
What are you wearing? 
Jenna, love, it's English director Christopher Nolan. 
Mr. Nolan, 
I saw you across the room at the Dark Knight premiere. 
I was shooting blow darts at Maggie Gyllenhal from a heating vent. 
Yes. How would you like 
to be in my next movie? 
I quit this show! 
To hell with you all! 
Go to hell! 
I just need you to do a quick camera test for me. 
I do not understand Christopher Nolan's methods. 
He's directing a live-action Smurfs sequel, so I went to Times Square, did cartwheels like he asked... 
Oh, boy. 
We got the whole thing on tape. 
This was a prank? 
This isn't body paint. 
It's a spray they use to kill geese at airports. 
What happened, J-Mo? 
Did you pass out in a goose costume at LaGuardia? 
Ugh, what is that smell, Tracy? 
It's the new fragrance I designed. 
It's called "Desire," but with a "Z" instead of the second "E." 
What is that supposed to smell like? 
All my favorite things. 
The Knicks, a mop from a strip club, a carefree hobo, a crate with a new giraffe in it, and broccoli. 
It smells disgusting. 
Yeah, I wouldn't know. 
I lost my sense of smell years ago. 
But when one sense goes away, the others make up for it. 
I have an incredible sense of touch. 
I feel an old Jack-o-lantern from last Halloween. 
Are you serious? 
You can't smell? 
Why haven't you been to a doctor? 
Who has the time, with work, family and hobbies and listing excuses? 
Oh, my. 
It smells like grandma's house at Christmas. 
That's when we found her dead on the toilet. 
Pete, I spent the morning going over these Kabletown self-evaluations. 
Your evaluation gave me pause. 
Are you sure? 
Those look like hands to me. 
Here's the problem. 
In answer to the question, "where do you see yourself in five years?" 
You wrote, "right where I am." 
That's an unacceptable answer. 
I mean, what if the Wright brothers had said, "let's just keep making bicycles," or Alexander windowblinds had said, "no, I don't want to partially see outside"? 
Yeah, no, I get what you're saying, but I'm Pete Hornberger. 
The last time I tried to put myself out there, the girl turned out to be a cop. 
Do you understand how this attitude reflects on me? 
I am also required to complete one of these inane self-evaluations. 
It's a farce. 
What? 
Like Frasier? 
But that's fun... 
But I can't say I'm succeeding as a manager if you're failing as an employee. 
You have no ambition, Pete. 
No, no, you don't understand. 
For me, that five years thing is very ambitious. 
Look at my life, Jack. 
My father was a congressman. 
I was valedictorian at St. Andrew's, 
an olympic archer, fourth guitarist in Loverboy... 
As a teenager. 
It's almost unbelievable. 
If it weren't all true, I'd say it doesn't even make sense. 
But now look at me. 
The last two decades have been a freefall. 
If I could stay in the same place for the next five years, that would be a huge accomplishment. 
Do you know who you remind me of? 
George W. Bush, 
during his "let's do coke and buy the Texas rangers" phase. 
But he made a decision to be the best president ever and then he was. 
You've lost your mojo, Pete. 
And I'm going to get it back for you. 
Well, something is definitely obstructing your sinus cavity. 
Now we have two options. 
I can either drill a hole in the back of your head, and push it out with your brain... 
Okay, that sounds good. 
Or I could just pull it out through your nostril. 
We'll do the second one. 
Thank you. 
You know, they don't tell you this until after you've paid for medical school, but being a doctor is exactly like the game "Operation." 
And there we go. 
My buck Rogers decoder ring! 
How long has that been in there? 
Those things are from the '70s. 
Yeah, you know what else is from the '70s? 
Women staying quiet. 
I totally remember this. 
When I was nine, I found it on the floor of the "G" train. 
I knew if my Foster mom saw it, she would make me sell it at a pawn shop to get our family a cheerio. 
Okay, sometimes I think the stories of your childhood poverty are exaggerated, but continue. 
So I hid the ring up my nose. 
I must have forgot about it. 
You may feel some burning and tingling, but you should regain normal sensation in just a few hours. 
Oh, I'm sorry, I was talking to my lover on my Bluetooth. 
Uh, one moment, suki. 
Anyway, Tracy, you should start regaining sensation in less than an hour. 
But a newly regained sense can be a very powerful thing. 
Even overwhelming. 
So if you do have an extreme reaction, please try to get it on video for my nephew's funny website. 
Uh, Liz, are you getting enough vitamin "C"? 
May I suggest messily eating an orange while I photograph it? 
Kenneth, what do you know about revenge? 
Well, the Bible says it's wrong, but it's the surprise hit of the season on ABC, so I don't know. 
Anyway, I know how busy you are, so I got you some more tattoo concealer. 
Thank you. 
I just ran out. 
I was so young when I got this. 
Who even remembers 2007? 
Wait, how did you know I was out of concealer? 
From your trash, Mrs. Maroney. 
The garbage man knows all. 
In this big trash bag, I see everyone's mistakes, their embarrassing secrets, their dreams they don't dare share with anyone. 
Oh! 
Like this. 
Interesting. 
Kenneth, you don't happen to have the other writers' trash in there, do you? 
No. 
I can't handle that much volume. 
I'm kidding. 
They call me "the natural." 
I'm so good, the other janitors just sit in the basement all day getting drunk and laughing about this idiot they know. 
Oh, no. 
Kenneth, this concealer is the wrong color. 
Oh, no. 
I'll be right back. 
Keep an eye on my trash cart? 
Oh, I'll keep an eye on it. 
Look at us, laughing together, like a couple of Jews watching The Daily Show. 
This is the gym of the New York racquet club, Pete. 
Theodore Roosevelt was a member here. 
In fact, many of the animal heads mounted downstairs were shot by T.R. 
Including the one that looked like a terrified Asian man? 
It was a different time, Pete. 
Today, the most powerful men in New York still come here to exercise. 
And nothing is a better workout for body and soul than boxing. 
It's the first sport man ever invented. 
Except of course, uh, hide and seek. 
Shh. 
Uh, yeah. 
Boxing is primal, Pete. 
It's exactly what you need. 
So come on, don't just stand there. 
Throw a punch, feel like a man. 
A man who, years ago, was on top of the world, who saw Paula and dragged her back to his cave. 
Actually she took me that first night. 
Hit something. 
Put your frustration into your fists and hit something! 
Hornberger! 
Get up, Pete. 
Get up and fight. 
For God's sake, Hornberger, the dummy is winning! 
Why are you kissing it? 
I'm submitting to its strength. 
It's the Alpha. 
Good morning, fresh coffee. 
Good morning, clean floor. 
Funny, Kenneth. 
You don't have any smell at all. 
Don't worry about it. 
 Perfume and roses and strong halitosis   powders and flowers and spicy clam chowders   I can smell, I can smell, I can smell   I can smell   I can...  
Daddy? 
 Nice save. 
 Oh, no. 
Vengeance announcement. 
Look what I found in the trash. 
An email confirmation in Frank's name for one ticket to see Taylor Swift at Nassau Coliseum. 
She writes the songs herself. 
When she can't cry any more, she writes! 
What are you laughing at, Toofer? 
You're the man who took professional boudoir photographs and then tried to mail them to Parade magazine columnist Marilyn Vos Savant. 
I happen to think that smart is sexy. 
Our foreplay would be puzzle-solving. 
Uh oh, Lutz's turn. 
What is this gonna be? 
Oh, no. I don't 
have anything for you. 
You don't matter. 
But if you two dirtbags ever mess with me again, I'll take this to the next level. 
You don't do 22 episodes of "Celebrity outhouse" with Lorena Bobbitt without learning a few things. 
You're at rehearsal before me? 
Of course I am, Liz-dad. 
I'm your good boy. 
I memorized all my lines, so can I go get dressed for the photo shoot now, so you don't have to wait for me? 
Sure, little buddy. 
You know, smell is the sense most closely associated with memory. 
I know, Dotcom, that's why whenever I smell that jacket, I remember being bored. 
The only person you're insulting with that attitude is yourself. 
Obviously something about the way I smell reminds Tracy of his dad. 
Well, his father did work for a soup factory and you are constantly eating. 
It's not a food thing, grizz. 
I think it's my hair pomade. 
Midnight symphony? 
My grandfather used that. 
Midnight symphony. 
You are the conductor of your own proud African orchestra. 
Midnight symphony. 
 You use midnight symphony? 
 It works, Dotcom. 
It was discontinued a few years ago, but I bought seven cases of it on eBay from a guy named Reggie. 
You're still here. 
You didn't go to the store for milk and heroin and then never come back. 
That was his excuse? 
You stayed because you love me. 
Right, daddy-Liz? 
I do love you... champ. 
 But I could love you more. 
 Well, you just wait. 
Watch this. 
Be careful, Liz. 
Be very careful. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Dotcom. 
Pete. 
Confidence is a spectrum. 
On one end, the ultra-confident end, you have people like Jack Donaghy, Vladimir Putin, Orville Redenbacher. 
Corn is not the only thing he popped, if you know what I mean. 
Then... 
You have the other end of the spectrum. 
Yeah, I get it. 
Men with no confidence. 
No, men who have nothing left to lose. 
Great men like Richard Nixon, the 1980 olympic hockey team, my good friend John Rambo. 
This is you. 
And I shouldn't have been trying to get you all the way to the tiger, because all you needed was a little push to get you to nothing left to lose. 
This is how you get your mojo back, Pete. 
No, I am there, Jack. 
My job is killing me, my family resents me, the other day I was mugged by what I'm pretty sure was two five-year-olds in a trench coat. 
I already have nothing left to lose. 
No, you have one more thing. 
No. Not the ring. 
You're clinging to something that's gone, Pete, and it's not coming back. 
Allow yourself to be reborn. 
Your life is tied to the fate of the ring. 
It must be destroyed. 
Are you quoting Lord of the rings? 
No, I'm quoting myself talking to Bruce Willis. 
Well, well, well. 
If it isn't tweedle-Dee and tweedle-black. 
We need to talk about what you did. 
Well, you know what they say, boys. 
If you can't stand the heat, get off of Mickey Rourke's sex grill. 
No, this isn't about us. 
It's Lutz. 
 I didn't do anything to Lutz. 
 That's the problem. 
He has a thing about being left out of stuff. 
The man has self-esteem issues. 
I don't know why. 
Well, he is estranged from his son Kellan Lutz from Twilight. 
I'm sorry, are you asking me to apologize to him? 
Look, yeah, we mess with people, but there's a line we don't cross. 
For example, after you went through our trash, we went through yours. 
And we found this. 
My self-evaluation! 
I want to be famous to make people love me because I hate myself. 
The Jenna I talk to at night in the mirror thinks I should kill myself. 
Also, I caused that Italian cruise ship to crash. 
We could do a lot of damage with this. 
But we're not going to. 
Whatever. 
Hey. 
How's my boy? 
Working hard? 
So hard, papa Lemon. 
You're not gonna wanna run away and start a new family in Ohio and have a daughter you also name Tracy. 
Not if you're good. 
I've been thinking of some new characters for the show. 
This is my Jimmy Fallen impression. 
Awesome, awesome, I love it! 
It's my favorite! 
Wow, Tracy, that's great. 
Tracy, what's all this stuff? 
Just some stuff I needed from home, like my bed. 
It's a California Kong, which is two California kings tied together with gorilla leather. 
 Wait, you're living here? 
 I have to. 
Turns out Angie's cooking smells very ethnic, and I definitely can't be around my family. 
I didn't expect this, but teenage boys don't smell good. 
Wait, you can't be around your kids? 
What about baby Virginia? 
Do you know what she does in her underwear? 
Something I once did at the oscars that caused Daryl Hannah to throw up on me. 
Tracy, you can't just abandon your family. 
I've got all the family I need right here, L.L. 
Now back to work. 
"Open on: Philadelphia, 1776. 
John Adams and Mitt Romney enter." 
Commentary! 
So stupid, Lutz. 
Disgusting. 
Why don't you learn your lesson and stop trying? 
That girl at Starbucks smiles at everybody, Lutz. 
Everybody! 
She doesn't want you to kiss her. 
No wonder people don't include you in things. 
No wonder Kellan never wants to see you again. 
You're worthless. 
Kenneth, be honest. 
Am I the worst person you know? 
Ms. Maroney, judging 
is for God and his angels. 
So, yes, you are. 
Where's the writers' trash? 
Oh, I've already taken it down to the sub-basement compacter room. 
The writers had me clean out their refrigerator today, so the trash smelled like, to use a technical janitorial term, total ass. 
Kellan, why? 
Okay, I know the answer to this, but I just need to hear it. 
If I have to choose between work productivity and what's best for one of my employees, I choose work, right? 
Great. Thank you. 
Something about my shoes. 
 Good meeting. 
 Uh, which employee? 
Gah, what does it matter? 
It's Tracy and he has never been more productive. 
But he abandoned his family and his baby daughter to do it. 
Lemon, I invented business mumbling. 
 You white garbage bag full of pudding. 
What? 
Look, when you're a supervisor, your job is to squeeze everything you can out of your employees, but there's a line and you've crossed it. 
Since when do you care about any line other than the bottom line? 
Sorkinesque Repartee. 
Because I'm doing it too. 
I'm taking advantage of Pete like you're taking advantage of Tracy. 
I said I'd fill out my self-evaluation after I'd fixed Pete. 
A task I knew deep down  could never be accomplished. 
 Yeah, he's a mess. 
But Pete's just an excuse. 
The fact is I can't fill this out because there's a question I don't know how to answer. 
"Where do you see yourself in five years?" 
For the first time in my career, I don't know. 
I could wind up anywhere. 
Running this company, making couches, serving as mayor of New York. 
Or I could be 6 feet under... 
In the subterranean paradise we built to escape the poor. 
Yeah, I get it. 
As a writer, that uncertainty is the fate that always I am to face being. 
Well, I'm not used to it. 
But that's not Pete's problem, it's mine. 
You go talk to Tracy and I have to stop Pete from shaving his head. 
Oh, God. 
So, Lutz. 
You thought I left you off the hook the other day? 
Well, you wish. 
I spent the whole night going through the garbage trying to find the perfect thing to humiliate you. 
Yeah, we know. 
We took photos of you and sold them to a garbage fetish website. 
This was all a prank? 
I knew the mirror thing would get her. 
Ooh, I'm so sad. 
I never talk to my son, Kellan. 
It's all made up, Jenna. 
Kellan Lutz isn't my son. 
He's my grandnephew and we're very close. 
Unbelievable. 
I was actually doing something nice for Lutz and... 
Oh, my God. 
I was doing something nice. 
You took advantage of my niceness. 
Why are you smiling? 
You spent the night in our garbage. 
We win! 
No, I win. 
On my self-evaluation, I said I'm the worst person I know. 
But it's not true! 
Thanks to you guys, I'm the fourth worst. 
 Jenna's amazing like a star in the sky   Jenna's amazing like a star in the sky  Pete, I apologize. 
I never should have told you how to live your life like some sort of American Barack Obama. 
Commentary. 
The truth of the matter is this whole thing wasn't even about you. 
It was about me. 
Really? 'Cause it seems 
like it was about me, Jack. 
Do you know what was under my hair? 
A birthmark. 
Good God. 
It looks like a swastika made out of penises. 
I know what it looks like! 
Since you've been "helping" me, my life has gotten worse. 
I broke my nose, a gay rabbi chased me through midtown, and last night, Paula wouldn't touch me looking like this. 
Do you know what it's like to try to have sex wearing a child's little orphan Annie wig? 
 No. 
 You know what? 
You've done enough. 
Get the hell out of my office. 
Congratulations, I knew I'd make a man out of you. 
Get out! 
There's the confidence. 
Please, just leave. 
Pete, you're welcome. 
You wanted to see me, smell? 
Sit down, champ. 
Oh, why are you so heavy? 
'Cause so much of me has died. 
Okay. 
Tracy, I'm so proud of you. 
You have grown into such a wonderful person for these last 24 hours. 
But when you're a father or even a father smell, sometimes you have to make sacrifices to do what's right for your family. 
I just wanna make you proud of me, L. L.-Dad-Liz-dad. 
I know. 
But there's only one thing you need to do to make me proud. 
Pop dookie down by the vacants? 
Boy, if I had a dollar for every time I've been asked to reverse one of my procedures, my bitch ex-wife would be a millionaire. 
May she rest in peace. 
 All right. 
 Wait, Dr. Spaceman. 
There's so much I haven't smelled yet. 
A magnolia tree in spring, the towels at a miss Hawaiian tropic contest, the sweat of a terrified Webster as you load him into a Cannon. 
Tracy, you have to do this. 
Now, full disclosure, I lost your ring at a Bodeans concert, so I'm gonna shove this hilarious pencil-topper up there. 
Get a haircut, or I'm gonna shove you up a black guy's nose. 
Very well. 
You leave me no choice then. 
Goodbye, helpful Tracy. 
Goodbye... daddy-head. 
Goodbye only evidence tying me to my ex-wife's disappearance. 
Aah! 
Five years from now? 
Well, I'd like to still be working for NBC, or whatever NBC is in five years. 
A T-shirt company probably? 
My greatest strength is that I'm a good listener. 
Watch. 
In five years, I hope I don't have to do this hat thing any more. 
In five years, I'll probably be dead and no one will even notice, and yes, this is my second attempt at writing my self evaluation.
