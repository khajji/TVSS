Now,remind me,did you just do the philadelphia cotillion, or did you also debut internationally? 
I'm happy to say that I don't even get that. 
 How was your trip? 
 Terrible. 
I had to give up my window seat to some sevenyearold who had to sit next to her precious mommy. 
What about the actual purpose of your tr? 
How is the search for the new cast member going? 
Okay. I saw a few good alternative 
comics in San Francisco. 
San Francisco? 
I asked you to find an actor from middle America,a real person. 
You're not going to find him in the people's gaypublic of drugifornia. 
Jeez,relax. I'm also setting 
up auditions in toronto. 
Canada? Why not just go to iraq? 
The television audience doesn't want your elitist east coast, alternative,intellectual,leftwing... 
Jack,just say Jewish. 
This is taking forever. 
Stop trying to amuse yourself and start thinking about what makes actual human beings laugh. 
Who wants... 
my puddings! 
Now that's what I'm talking about. 
What a dumb... 
oh,no,he's really hurt. 
Hey,tracy,did you hear? 
Fred dawkins,the incredibly overweight guy that pacman was based on died last night. 
I will eat a bowl of cherries and some ghost meat in his honor. 
Orange and black decorations? 
Is this halloween or princeton parents' weekend? 
I don't know whether to be scared or proud of my cousin. 
 It's halloween,sir. 
 Proud it is. 
But this "almost all saints' day" isn't gonna be much of a celebration. 
I just heard that worldfamous clog dancer jugbert cody has gone to a better place. 
He's in cabo? 
No,sir. He passed away. 
But at least he died doing what he loved... 
blogging on the huffington post. 
Two down,one to go. 
What do you mean? 
The rule of threes... 
celebrities always die in groups of three. 
You better be careful,tray. 
Yeah,right. That's not a real thing. 
This is gonna be the scariest princeton parents' weekend ever!

30 rock  s04e03 hey,I read your rewrite. 
Start over,you hack! 
Miss maroney,are you okay? 
Oh,I'm fine. 
Just reminding the writers who's boss. 
With this new actor coming in, I want to make sure I get taken care of. 
I'm not gonna be pushed aside and forgotten, like that time at my sister's funeral. 
Ma'am,I don't think bullying people is the way to get them to help you. 
This is show business. 
Being nice gets you nowhere. 
No. Being nice can get you everywhere. 
Florence henderson used to bake cookies for the brady bunch writers. 
And,in return,they wrote her the role of a lifetime, as her own grandma hutchins. 
I don't really remember the brady bunch,'cause I was too young. 
But being nice to the writers... 
interesting idea. 
Think about it. 
Excuse me,Mr. Donaghy. 
I wasn't sure if you were participating in this year's pumpkincarving contest, or,if like last year,I should go jump up my own ass. 
Same as last year. 
Uh,hang on. 
Kenneth,you're from georgia,aren't you? 
Stone mountain,sir. 
Although when the parcells first came to America, they lived in a town called sexcriminalboat. 
Do you think that's cherokee? 
Uh,no,I mean,you're a middle American,a Joe average. 
You're the only one around here who knows what ordinary people want. 
So tell me... what makes you laugh? 
The usual,I suppose. 
Two hobos sharing a bean... 
lady airline pilots. 
I remember,growing up in stone mountain, my whole family would go down to the chuckle hut. 
That's the local comedy club? 
Oh,no,sir. It's a chuckle hut. 
You see,the chuckle is the part of the pig between the tail and the anus. 
But at night,the chuckle hut becomes the laugh factory, and that's a comedy club. 
Lemon,cancel your trip to toronto. 
We're going to stone mountain,georgia. 
****** hey,Frank,what is this? 
It's an Evite to our halloween party. 
I don't want to do that again. 
Remember last year? 
Hey,I work across the street, and I saw you guys are having a halloween party. 
Yeah,we are. 
Could you close your blinds? 
You're really bumming all of us out. 
It's humiliating. 
Guys,we can't give up on halloween. 
It's a magical night where women dress slutty and drink too much, where we can hide our bodies in bulky costumes. 
We've got to keep trying. 
But we suck. 
Yes,but anything can happen on halloween. 
Up is down. Black is white. 
Good is evil. And evil... becomes good. 
Hey,writers. I baked you cookies. 
Jack! You have to help me. 
I'm gonna die any minute. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Celebrities. 
They always die in groups of three. 
Two already died,and I might be the next to go. 
That's ridiculous. 
I got to go somewhere where nothing will happen to me. 
Can you get me on Charlie rose? 
Tracy,you have nothing to worry about. 
The rule of threes is a myth that doesn't exist, like going bald with dignity. 
That said,I would prefer if you take the next one. 
So this all started when their plane crashed? 
That's lost. 
Oh,right. 
You know,I met j. J. Abrams once. 
And I don't know what this means, but he said the Island is just Hurley's dream. 
Why is jenna hanging out with us? 
'Cause she's freaking out about the new cast member. 
So she's trying to suck up. 
I don't like having her around. 
Don't worry. We'll get rid 
of her,one prank at a time. 
There my buddies are. 
Oh,wow,they painted the ceiling in here. 
We're going to find the perfect person for the show down here, someone who represents the real America. 
Jack,for the 80th time, no part of America is more American than any other part. 
You are wrong. 
Small towns are where you see the kindness and goodness and courage of everyday americans... 
the folks who are teaching our kids,running our prisons, growing our cigarettes... 
people who are still living by core American values. 
There are plenty of core American values in new York. 
But there are not restaurants called fatty fat sandwich ranch. 
Turn here. Turn here! 
Lemon,if this is going to play out like lunch, I suggest you crack your window now and save yourself the embarrassment in 20 minutes. 
Now,they have hush puppies here, which you might know better as a knish or a beignet. 
I know what you're trying to do,Jack. 
You want to paint me as this new York snob. 
Can I share with you my world view? 
I'd rather hear you sing rocket man again. 
All of humankind has one thing in common... 
the sandwich. 
I believe that all anyone really wants in this life is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich. 
What a surprise... your 
world view is foodbased. 
And who am I to say that my delicious Italian sub is better than its stone mountain equivalent? 
Which is why I will have the carp po'boy with extra chuckle. 
Keep refreshing. 
Maybe Andy dick has died in the last 20 seconds. 
Okay,I'll keep looking. 
No,I have to take matters into my own hands. 
 Hello? 
 Boo! 
Who is this? 
Hey,Betty,it's t. J. 
Tracy! 
I haven't seen you since that rappinggrandma movie we did. 
You were so funny as the rapping grandma. 
So how are you feeling? 
Any arm pain? 
Shortness of breath? 
Plans to investigate corruption in russia? 
Wait a minute. 
Are you calling because the pacman guy and jugbert cody died? 
 Is this a "rule of threes" call? 
 Um,no. 
Nice try,jordan,but I am going to be at your funeral. 
I will bury you. 
oh,this carp sandwich is not agreeing with my world view. 
Hello,there,folks. 
How y'all doing on this fine october... 
we have reservations under donaghy and lemon,and we need keys. 
Are y'all from new York? 
Yes. How can you tell? 
 New York people,always in a real big... 
 hurry,yeah. 
No,it's not because we're from new York. 
We're all the same sandwiches. 
You all have a beagle with you? 
Just give us our rooms. 
Oh,my God. 
Tell me about the peach festival. 
Oh,peach festival... 
they got peach preserves,of course, peach pie,peach wine,peach jerky... 
peach butter... 
unbelievable. 
I have to apologize. 
You know what they should do with people like her? 
They should round them all up and put them on an Island. 
Oh,wait,they already have. 
It's called Manhattan. 
Down here we call it sexcriminalboat. 
Maybe spend some photoshop there. 
Hey,Frank. 
Do you know sacha,Michael,and gay Michael? 
Can I ask you a question? 
Why? 
Oh,God,it's bad enough having jenna hang out here. 
Now she's bringing her friends? 
How can a dude in a midriff top dominate me like that? 
I like those guys. 
I might hang out with them on halloween. 
What? Why? 
Have you ever been to a gay halloween? 
It's amazing. 
Last year my girlfriends and I went to mario cantone's party in a renovated Barn in chelsea. 
So that's where all the girls are on halloween... 
at awesome gaydude parties. 
Oh,my God,we go so crazy. 
We kiss each other,get into vans,black out. 
I mean,I'm engaged,but not on halloween. 
Stop! Stop filling jenna's 
wigs with raw shrimp. 
 Why? 
 We need to pretend to be jenna's friends for the next 24 hours. 
She's our ticket to a gay halloween. 
How come when jenna suggests it,everybody's on board? 
No,lutz. Jenna attracts gay guys. 
Gay guys throw awesome halloween parties. 
Hot girls go to awesome halloween parties. 
Ergo,if we're jenna's friends... 
we spend halloween... 
 with hot girls. 
 With gay guys... 
hot girls. 
God,are you doing this to me 'cause I took that blind guy's hot dog? 
Who was at the door? 
You probably know him as "hick at the reception desk," but his name is travis hoagle, and,uh,he brought you something for your stomach. 
What is this? "peppy bismilk"? 
Why is everything a little different here? 
 I hate it! 
 You hate it? You hate travis hoagle... 
choir member,desert storm veteran,father of three? 
I made all that up,but you get my point. 
Do you even care that I am not feeling well? 
Of course I do. 
There,there. 
Thank you. That's nice. 
Well,I'd love to stay and do this all night, but one of us has to go to the laugh factory. 
No,I don't want you going there alone. 
Yes,you do. 
The people here... they're the 
audience we're trying to reach. 
I get them. I know what they want. 
I'm gonna find somebody great tonight. 
Hey,Rick,what's the difference between your girlfriend and your truck? 
I don't know,pumpkin. 
What is the difference? 
Your truck don't yell at you every time you get gas. 
Wonderful. Bravo 
hey... actor friend. 
So what are we all doing together for halloween? 
Oh,well,sacha and the michaels usually have a party. 
Oh,'cause lutz and toof and I always have a party. 
Hang on. 
What if we combined parties, threw one big party here in the studio? 
 Is that crazy? 
 No. Let's do that. 
Yes. 
That gesture. 
I like people who do that. 
A party with them? 
Oh,don't look at me like I'm a football game. 
I need those guys. 
I've been using them to make sure I'm taken care of when the new actor gets here. 
Girl,I don't even have the energy to tell you what's happening here,so read my face. 
Oh,my God! 
They're using me to get invited to gay halloween so they can meet hot girls. 
In metro news,Mary Hillman is going to gaffney for the weekend and hopes that Martha or stephanie will water her plants. 
And now an update on... 
very small town. 
Morning,lemon. I 
brought you a ginger ale. 
"Schwupps ginny pale"? 
This place is the worst. 
Don't worry. We're leaving. 
Our work here is done. 
In entertainment news, local funnymanand subshop owner Rick Wayne has been hired by a catholic to appear on tgs with a black fella. 
 What? 
 Hear me out. 
We're hiring Rick Wayne and pumpkin. 
It's a ventriloquist act. 
Oh,I'm too sick to handle this. 
See,you think you're not this prejudiced,arrogant new yorker, but you are,because in your mind, a southern ventriloquist act can't be funny. 
But you know who does think it's funny? 
These people... these 
wonderful,folksy,simple... 
stop calling them simple. 
You know what? You're the prejudice one. 
Sure,some of these people are simple, but some of them are smart,like matlock... 
or wholesome,like elly mae clampett. 
And some of them are skeevy dirt bags like the dukes of hazzard, driving around like maniacs. 
Children use those roads. 
My point is americans are the same everywhere in that we are all different. 
You're wrong,lemon. 
These people are better,purer. 
Do you know what I did this morning? 
I assisted in the birth of a foal. 
They named it Jack. 
And it was delicious. 
I know what I'm doing here,lemon. 
We're hiring Rick and pumpkin. 
We're not hiring anyone until I see them. 
Good God,lemon,your breath. 
When did you find time to eat a diaper that you found on the beach? 
Hi,I'm trying to get to studio 6b from here. 
I'm still finding my way around. 
You look clean. 
You a celebrity? 
I have my own show on NBC. 
No. Celebrity. 
I was in a movie with queen latifah once. 
Perfect. 
I'll show you the shortcut. 
Okay,you're sure this is the right way? 
Yes,queen latifah's friend. 
I'm sure. 
Mr. Jordan! 
Are you trying to kill Mr. 
Fallon with that hammer? 
What the hell? 
Is this a "rule of threes" thing? 
Not cool,guy. 
I'm sorry,Ken. 
But I want to live. 
Mr. Jordan,you're going to be fine. 
There is no rule of threes. 
 Iook out! 
 Okay,okay,truce. Truce,okay? 
But if some celebrity doesn't die soon, I'm gonna kill my first guest tonight. 
It's a dog who plays soccer. 
Really? That's your first guest? 
Yeah. 
Pete,I'm not gonna let this happen. 
But what can you do? 
Well,Jack says I'm just an obnoxious new yorker, so that's what Rick Wayne is gonna get tonight. 
And it's gonna get ugly. 
What are you... 
oh,my God,you're gonna heckle him, like that time I invited you to see my cover band. 
Yeah,and today the world is better off without the Pete hornberger Alan Parsons project project. 
I may be dehydrated. 
I may still be working a little chuckle out of my system,but don't worry. 
When I'm done,the last thing Rick Wayne and pumpkin are gonna want to do is come to new York. 
You guys,I am so excited. 
I already put on my costume. 
Get it? I'm an Italian senator. 
Don't you love it? 
It's gonna be awesome. 
And with one word,I can make it all go away. 
Wait,wwhat are you talking about? 
Oh,cut the crap. 
You boys are just pretending to like me to get in on gay halloween. 
Okay. What do you want? 
I want two good sketches a week, a promise to hate the new cast member, and no more making fun of me when I misuse dated cultural references. 
Okay? Are we cowabunga on this? 
 Fine,we're... we're cowabunga. 
 Good. 
But if I wake up in any of your apartments tomorrow morning, you will buy me breakfast. 
All right,the last pig is in the chuckling chute. 
And we're now the laugh factory. 
We got a great show for y'all tonight, and we're gonna get right to it with stone mountain's own Rick Wayne and pumpkin. 
All right,you asked for it. 
 Good evening,everyone. 
 How y'all doing? 
Hey,this your first time doing this? 
I'm sorry,I didn't know it was filthy, thinlipped hooker night here at the laugh factory. 
Okay. I underestimated you. 
Knock,knock. Who's there,pumpkin? 
A ferretfaced skank. 
Yep,I see her too. 
Get a job,hayseed. 
Are you still talking? 
You are one mouthy bitch. 
I don't go down to where you work and stop them from milking you. 
I'm sorry,but that's enough,sir. 
You're out of line. 
I'll tell you what's out of line. 
Your old lady's knockers. 
Good lord,woman. I 
wouldn't you with elmo's. 
Rick,pumpkin,what are you doing? 
A gentleman,whether he's human or somehow more than human, does not speak to a lady like that. 
You two are wholesome and decent. 
Oh,I get it. You think 'cause we talk 
like this,we're all simple and quaint. 
Well,I'm an amateur astronomer,and Rick's black wife speaks French. 
Her name's jamilla. 
See,I told you. There's 
no "real America. 
" You shut that dog rectum you call a mouth? 
Yes,sir. 
Why are you people laughing at this? 
You're supposed to be better,nicer,but you're terrible. 
You're all terrible,just like the people in new York. 
All God's children are terrible. 
Terrible,huh? I got a 
question for you there,pal. 
Do you ever find smaller heads orbiting your head? 
Is that a comment about the size of my head? 
I'm a tall man,and it's proportional to my frame. 
Your frame? What are they 
building there... a super walmart? 
You come down here and say that. 
I can't. I got a man's arm stuck up me. 
But you know what that's like. 
I can't believe I bought a fatty fat sandwich franchise! 
Oh,God,he's murdering me. His 
head is so much bigger up close! 
The deal's off,Wayne. 
Lemon,to the kia sorrento!

Proudly Presents =http://bbs.sfileydy.com= 
﻿1  Hey, Jack. 
 Congratulations, Lemon. 
I see you read my memo about having more catchphrases on your show. 
What catchphrases? 
Oh, are you talking about... 
If your man leaves in boxers and comes home in briefs, That's a deal breaker, ladies. 
If he wears an Atlanta falcons jersey to your sister's wedding... 
 "That's a deal breaker, ladies." 
This is gonna be huge for Jenna. 
And for me, 'cause I wrote that phrase. 
If you say so, Lemon. 
Jack, is this really what you wanted to talk about? 
What else is there to discuss? 
Oh, really? 
You're gonna do the repressed Irish thing? 
Be Italian for like one second. 
I'm-a Jack. 
I don't know who my father is. 
I'm-a so emotional, I'm gonna smash these barrels! 
We're not discussing that because I've made a decision. 
I don't wanna know who my real father is. 
Are you kidding? Why? 
You know what family means to me, Lemon? 
Resentment, guilt, anger... 
Easter egg hunts that turn into knife fights. 
Why would I wanna invite more of it into my life? 
Why would I want more family? 
Because maybe he's awesome. 
Look, why don't you just ask your mother who it is. 
No, no. 
Not colleen. 
She had her reasons for keeping this from me for 50 years, And I don't want her to relive it. 
Also, I want something really juicy To whisper to her on her deathbed. 
Look, Jack, I don't have a lot of personal life experience, But if I have learned anything from my Sims family... 
When a child doesn't see his father enough, He starts to jump up and down, And then his mood level will drop... 
Until he pees himself. 
Why don't I have any other friends? 
  Come on in, Jack, I'm just practicing sitting. 
Tracy, why did you never try to find your father? 
 Because he's dead. 
 How do you know that? 
Because I'm rich, and if that man was alive, He'd be living in my pool house, And I'd be paying him $200,000 a year to mow my lawn. 
Exactly. That's all family 
is--a drain. 
I feel like you're not tellin' me something, Jack. 
Let me guess--you bought a sidecar for your motorcycle, And your dog won't stay in it. 
No, Tracy. 
I found out I don't know who my father is, And I'm not sure I ever wanna know. 
Why? Jack, every man 
should know his father. 
 That's easy for you to say. 
 No, it wasn't. 
I struggled through that sentence. 
But I'm know what I'm talkin' about. 
Because not long ago... 
A son I didn't know about found me. 
 What? 
My love child tracked me down. 
I was shocked, scared, angry, like a dog in a sidecar When it comes loose from the motorcycle. 
But it turned out to be One of the best things that ever happened to me. 
Huh. 
Thanks, Tracy. 
And you know who else loves deal breaker? 
Bret Michaels. 
We have the same publicist, and she said he'd love to come here And dress in the same outfit and do it with me. 
And also, he wants to be on the show. 
You know, they used that catchphrase On Sportscenter last night. 
Rangers on the power play. 
Oh, Avery! 
That's a deal breaker, ladies. 
This is it! 
This is the defining thing of my life! 
It's not gonna be that hit and run! 
Jenna, calm down. 
Oh, Liz, try to imagine how excited you would be If something of yours blew up like this. 
This is mine, Jenna. 
I wrote it for you, remember? 
Right! It's ours. 
That's what I meant to say. 
There's a reason you're the writer. 
Everybody, gather up. 
Actor announcement. 
No--human announcement. 
There's something I want you all to hear directly from me Before you read about it in next month's issue Of black entrepreneur and butts magazine. 
I have a illegitimate son. 
   Oh! Feigned surprise. 
Obviously, my family and I wanted to keep this private, But somehow, those vultures in the media found out about it. 
Like a dog in the sidecar When it comes loose from the motorcycle. 
But it turned out to be One of the best things that ever happened to me. 
Huh. Thanks, Tracy. 
So...Should we continue 
our interview? 
Oh, no! 
Now, I didn't know about this boy up until three years ago. 
But I've been supporting him financially ever since. 
 And I want you all to meet him. 
 He's here? 
I want you bastards to meet my bastard. 
My baby boy, Donald Jordan. 
Hey, how's it goin', y'all? 
Pop, can I have $1,000 for something I need? 
Well, as long as it's for something you need. 
 I love you, man. 
 I love you, daddy. 
Oh, Len, come in. 
Thanks for meeting me here. 
 This is my office. 
 I know. 
But once I'm in the building, I can get into the cafeteria, And that means free ice. 
Right. So what did you 
dig up for me? 
Well, I was surprised when you called me About finding your father. 
Especially since you called on the old home line. 
Hasn't been ringing much since Marcia left. 
I guess in the divorce settlement, She got all our friends. 
I gave my gun to my pastor. 
You know, in case I get the old gloomies again. 
So do you have anything for me, Len? 
Your father's name and contact information Is in this envelope. 
I'm sorry. 
I'll give ya some privacy. 
Oh, God. 
There's no way that's Tracy's son, right? 
That guy is scamming him! 
May be. 
Donald did look pretty old. 
I know. 
But I do have a hard time telling ages with black Shoes are the best kind of shoes. 
How old do you think I am? 
 25. 
 50. 
I am 33. 
How old do you think Samuel L. Jackson is? 
 50. 
 25. 
Mr. Jackson is 61. 
Wow! 
Okay, what about this? 
Maybe Donald's is Tracy's son because maybe Tracy is 60. 
 No. That's ridiculous. 
 Think about it. 
He can't rap. 
He has diabetes. 
A lot of his friends are dead. 
He falls asleep in chairs. 
He doesn't know how to use a computer. 
 He's always mad at the TV! 
 His favorite show is NCIS. 
 He might be 70! 
 Or he's getting scammed. 
Lemon. 
I don't get it. 
There's three names on here. 
Without hard DNA evidence, Len was only able to narrow my father's identity Down to these three men. 
Mamma Mia! 
It's a Mamma Mia! 
 What? 
 Nothing! 
Don't push it, Liz. 
Let it happen. 
There's gonna be a Mamma Mia! 
See what happens, Lemon? 
See how complicated family always is? 
What am I supposed to do, fly around the country Trying to figure out which one is my father? 
They could come to you. 
We could trick them into coming here, And then we'll sing on the dock! 
What are you talking about? 
It's Mamma Mia! 
The international film songsation? 
Based on the jukebox musical? 
The songs of Abba? 
It's a movie, Jack! 
Should we just watch it real quick? 
This was too much trouble when it was just one person. 
 I'm out. 
 No, it's perfect! 
We Mamma Mia these guys. 
We get them here under some pretense, Figure out which one is your dad, And then if it's someone you don't want in your life, You walk away. 
How do we even get them here? 
They won a contest A trip to new york and tickets to TGS. 
All right... 
You get them here. 
I'll meet with them. 
But that's all I'm promising. 
And all I'm promising is a madcap musical romp, dot, dot, dot, fun, dot, dot, dot. 
Good! 
That was on the poster. 
Why won't this stupid gizmo do what I want? 
I'm gonna miss the lotto drawing. 
Ahem. Hey, Tracy... 
You're 39, right? 
Of course. 
Why would I lie about my age? 
I'm in the entertainment industry. 
Right. Hey, you know, Liz 
and I were just talking about That old Rob Base song It Takes Two. 
Yeah, everybody our age knows that song, right? 
 Ladies love me, girls adore me   I mean even the ones who never saw me   ♪ Like the way that I rhyme at a show   The reason why, man, I don't know   So let's go, 'cause   It takes two   to make a thing go right   It takes two to make it outta sight  Not familiar. 
But what about this song? 
 Gee, it's great after being out late   Walkin' my baby back--   How old are you? 
 39. 
Well, if you're 39, how old do you think Donald is? 
 I'm 21, right, dad? 
 Yes, you are, son. 
That's what that birth certificate You printed out for me said. 
Hey, you got that check for me? 
Of course...And I left 
the amount blank Just like you asked. 
Donald's openin' a dojo. 
Mm-hmm, yeah. 
I'm-a teach karate and whatnot to kids... 
Or whatever. 
Startin' a small business is expensive! 
 I bet it is. 
 Hey, remember this song? 
 If e'er a fair maiden a knight chanced to see   Astride his fair steed to spy  Miss Lemon, the contest winners are here. 
 My three dads! 
 Are you ready to meet them? 
  Yeah. 
Jack, this is George Park. 
He's Korean. 
Oh! Okay. 
Welcome, Mr. Park. 
And, uh, this is Fred O'Dwyer. 
Mr. O'Dwyer, 
tell Jack the story you were telling in the elevator. 
In world war II, a Kraut grenade exploded my genitals. 
Oh. So...No children, 
right? 
No chance. 
Looks like a bowl of spaghettios down there. 
And Jack, this is Professor Milton Greene. 
Nice to meet you. 
And it's nice to meet you, Jack. 
 Sorry. There was 
something in my throat. 
I'm Milton Greene. 
Have a seat. 
Oh, Jenna has a photo shoot for Time Out magazine. 
 For what? 
 Um...Nothing. 
They're gonna name her the funniest woman in new york. 
Oh. What time do they 
need me there To make her seem funny? 
Look, I know you're upset, but Jenna fully acknowledges That you write the deal breaker sketches together. 
Yeah, we write them together. 
She texts her gay friends while I write till 4:00 in the morning Eating dry fistfuls of raisin bran to stay awake. 
Which, by the way, Is how I'm able to ride the fart train to work every day. 
Liz...Hey. 
This is your job. 
This is what you signed up for. 
I know. 
I like it when you use your calm, reasonable dad voice. 
That's the voice you should use when you tell Jenna That I'm gonna be in that magazine with her. 
I'm-a save this for later. 
Look at that scammer. 
What 21-year-old wraps up half a muffin? 
Hey... 
Kenny. 
Well, hello, stranger. 
 Do you like magazines? 
 I sure like S&M magazines. 
S&M is my abbreviation for super and magical. 
Yeah, well, I'm selling magazine subscriptions To benefit the, uh, community center. 
 How many you want? 
 Four? 
Great! That's like... 
$80! 
I'm-a get your address from my daddy. 
Oh, instead of doing it now. 
Good plan! 
We gotta stop that guy. 
How can we prove to Tracy that Donald's lying? 
Well, I've asked Cerie To look into getting a copy of his birth certificate. 
No. You can't get someone 
else's birth certificate. 
I know, because I've been trying to steal My dead neighbor's identity Because sometimes it feels like too much, And maybe daddy just needs to get in the car and drive. 
We gotta catch Donald in a lie. 
What else do we know about him? 
Well, he claims to know karate. 
That's gotta be bogus. 
But how do you test someone's knowledge of karate? 
I know karate. 
Um, so gentlemen, Is there any history of mental illness in your family? 
Oh, don't get me started. 
My cousin killed everyone at his job. 
How 'bout you, Milton? 
No, no, the Greenes are sharp as a tack, Right to the end. 
Which makes the end all that much more terrifying. 
My father died screaming. 
oh. Greene 
that's sort of a vague name. 
You meet a lot of other Greenes at your...Church? 
Christmas? 
We're agnostic secular humanists. 
Sure, but if you had to pick... 
Is that you and Tom Delay? 
Uh, yes. 
"The Hammer" is a hero of mine. 
   II'm sorry. 
Did you just snort at our former house majority leader? 
He was never my house majority leader. 
You've got to be kidding me. 
Here's Tom Delay's legacy to the United States: Raping the environment, waging an illegal war History will validate the liberation of Iraq. 
I was talking about the war on drugs. 
Not to mention the hypocrisy of espousing family values While demonizing single mothers. 
What would you know about single mothers? 
What would you know about families? 
I will not be spoken to this way. 
I'm a contest winner. 
And a professor at Bennington College. 
Oh...Bennington! 
How's that going, teaching all those kids That couldn't get into Middlebury? 
 How dare you! 
 How dare you. 
You are a huge disappointment to me. 
I do not understand why we're yelling at each other, But I am not accustomed to losing an argument. 
So you know what? 
Screw you. 
And your fakakte contest. 
Oh God no! 
Looking beautiful. 
Uh...I'm gonna 
get some tape. 
Oh, my God, Liz. 
I'm so glad that you've insisted on doing this. 
Yay! Well, thank you 
for so graciously including me. 
I know this kind of thing is all that you have in your life. 
Aw! 
Wait--what is that? 
Bellafonte, what is that stuff? 
I just thought that for some of the pictures, It'd be fun if we got a little wacky. 
Okay, look. 
I know you've never done this before, But I had to learn the hard way--don't use the props. 
They always try to get you to take one funny photo. 
That's always the one they use, and you look like an idiot. 
That's always the one they use, huh? 
Don't do it. 
Just open your mouth a little And try to look like Lindsay Lohan. 
Great. 
Fabulous, ladies. 
You look beautiful. 
Now, Jenna, catch the chicken. 
Nice try, pal. 
Not my first time on the merry-go-round, chief. 
Not gonna do it. 
Staying like this serious and horny. 
I don't know. 
With the chicken, it could make a great cover. 
I'll hold the chicken. 
 Great. 
That's great. 
That's so great. 
Now act like the chicken farted. 
Yes, yes. 
You're the funny one. 
Great! 
That's so great. 
I am Lutz. 
I understand you study the art of the empty hand. 
I challenge you to kumite! 
Hah! Whhhh! Eeee! Whooo. 
Front kick. 
Front kick! 
Uh, uh, escape kata! 
Ow! 
Pete, Liz, I see you! 
Help mommy's baby! 
help mommy's baby! 
Jack, what did you say to Milton? 
If Cornel West weren't speaking at the new school tonight, I think he would have left. 
He should leave. 
It's exactly what I was afraid of. 
More family, more aggravation. 
 I'm walking away. 
 Why? He's just like you. 
He's smart and worldly, And he's really good at making fun of my shoes. 
When he saw these, He asked me when my cult was committing suicide. 
Okay, that's pretty good. 
But Milton Greene and I are nothing alike. 
I have one scotch with the guy, And it devolves into a screaming match about tom Delay. 
So you have a couple drinks, fight about politics, And then you take it personally when he doesn't agree with you? 
That's called having a dad, Jack. 
Don't walk away. 
I think you'll regret it if you do. 
Or I could regret telling him. 
Why would a man like that want me as a son? 
Maybe he won't. 
I don't know. 
But so what? 
Yeah, it'd hurt, But then you'd just go back to being Jack Donaghy, Which is pretty cool. 
Thank you. 
My hair just dries like this. 
Exactly. Or you tell him, 
and he starts crying And you hug, and then you have a dad. 
Which is pretty cool too. 
 Maybe you're right. 
 I am right. 
Either way, you're gonna be okay. 
One of those two things is gonna happen. 
There's no weird third thing. 
Thank you, Liz. 
By the way, did the medical supply store Where you bought those shoes have any...Women's stuff? 
Well, Donald obviously knows karate. 
We still don't know how old any African-Americans are. 
Oh, that reminds me. 
I got the birth certificate that you asked for. 
You did? How? 
The guy at the place just gave it to me. 
You will get old someday. 
Tracy, stop writing that check. 
He's 40. 
Don't sign that. 
Okay. That was to put 
in Dotcom's birthday card. 
But you're right... 
The card is enough. 
Tracy... 
Donald is older than you are. 
He's scamming you! 
I know. 
I'm sorry, what? 
Liz Lemon, I may hug people too hard And get lost at malls... 
But I'm not an idiot. 
Then why are you giving him all this money? 
When Donald came to me, He was a fast-talking charmer From the wrong side of the track. 
He reminded me of someone, Liz Lemon John Travolta's character from Grease! 
And me. 
So giving Donald money is what--charity? 
Call it what you want. 
But in the last three years, Donald has gone from scamming celebrities To being a small business owner. 
The dojo is real? 
And the community center is thriving. 
You know Kenneth's $80 bought a chess set And a crate of condoms? 
Those kids are really lucky. 
Hey. 
Daddy, do you wanna go uptown and see the dojo? 
Or should I say the Tracy Jordan institute for black karate? 
That's what y'all namin' it? 
Thank you, son. 
Thank you. 
Well, I hope you're happy with your cover. 
Oh, boy. 
They went with birthing the chicken on the toilet. 
Why didn't you listen to me? 
Because I thought you were just trying to keep me from being in the magazine. 
I was just trying to keep you from embarrassing both of us. 
Well, you wanted attention. 
You got it. 
I hope you're happy. 
I'm on the cover! 
And this is the backstage area. 
Kenneth, I'd like to speak with Mr. Greene for a moment. 
And as head of this tour, I'm going to deny your request. 
Uh, Milton... 
Do you remember a woman named Colleen Donaghy? 
Sure. 
 That takes me back a few years. 
 1958? 
 Yeah, right. 
She rented me a room when I was a graduate student. 
One month I couldn't pay, So she said maybe there was something else I could give her. 
 So I gave her my radio. 
  Oh. 
And a couple of weeks later, we got drunk and had sex. 
Uh...Okay. 
I'm Jack Donaghy, colleen's son. 
I was born around nine months after that. 
Oh, my God. 
Wha--wait a minute. 
I-is this contest some Mamma Mia thing? 
Milton... 
I'm your son. 
Oh...Of course you are. 
I should have known the minute I saw you. 
I have a son! 
A beautiful son! 
And I have a dad! 
Fate has brought us together, Jack. 
You opened a whole new chapter in my life! 
Yeah. Isn't it amazing? 
Oh, you don't know the half of it! 
I need a kidney! 
Oh, God! 
This is so great! 
Miss Lemon! Let me help you out. 
Thanks, Kenneth. 
What are all these little plastic containers for? 
Are you pickling squirrel meat? 
Cause I can lend you my skull presser No, I went to the new flagship compartment store on 5th Avenue and got everything I need to get my life in order. 
A stacker thing to separate junk mail from your humidifier catalogs. 
A thing you stick on your laptop that holds your keys. 
A round plastic deal that holds your shoes with a pocket for a photograph of what shoes are in there. 
I'm going to become wonderful. 
It's a new beginning. 
 Like a phoenix rise... 
 Look out! 
Or... 
maybe this is gonna be the worst day ever. 
Subtitles:  Feygnasse Team  Episode 314: "The Funcooker" Morning meeting. 
Everybody shut up. 
Shut up, Lutz. 
Already today, I have lost faith in decor-ganizing, chipped a tooth... 
And lost a shoving match to what I thought was a female bike messenger. 
So I am asking all of you for the next 12 to 14 hours to just be cool. 
Let's have a normal day. 
 Guys, seriously, be cool. 
 Why are you not wearing pants? 
They still have the heat set for winter, and my office is boiling. 
Put on your pants! 
Please make me a dentist appointment today. 
You can't go today. 
You have jury duty. 
What? No! 
I'm registered in Illinois. 
How did New York find me? 
I changed your voter registration for you. 
What's wrong? 
You told me to be more proactive. 
I told you to buy more Proactiv! 
Mr. Donaghy wants to see you now 
about what Jenna and Tracy did during St. Patrick's day parade. 
Was it something good? 
Have a seat. It was very simple. 
I asked you two to host NBC's coverage of St. Patrick's day parade. 
Read the cue cards. Promote the show. 
So would you explain to Mr. O'Cannon 
why it went so very wrong? 
Sir, as I'm sure you know from reading my blog, I'm currently shooting a feature film inspired by, but, for legal reasons, not based on Janis Joplin. 
Synonym's just another word for the word you wanna use we can't sing the original songs, but it's gonna be phenomenal. 
But, between the movie at night and working here during the day, I am so exhausted. 
So when I got to the parade... 
That's no excuse, ye banshee. 
You and this gravy face have slarneyed up a real donnybrook. 
Here comes the County Cork steppers. 
Their traditional dance celebrates the spirit and the ingenuity of the Irish people. 
Wake up, mother... 
You're a disgrace. 
Passing out and cursing on St. Patrick's day? 
Is nothing sacred? 
I should be rewarded for going this long without swearing on live TV. 
The FCC disagrees. They've decided 
to make an example of you  and fine you personally $50,000. 
 50 grand? 
Can anyone cut this in half? 
Look at you! I told you. 
You're spreading yourself too thin. 
 I only heard the thin part. 
 Lemon is right. 
Obviously, you can't do both TGS and Janie Jimplin. 
I choose the movie. 
My face is bigger on it. 
I don't mean quit, Liz will find a way to make both work. 
Am I right? 
I'll have to use you less in the show. 
And I'll scale back the movie. 
We could cut the lesbian scene. 
But the Oscars love that kind of thing. 
There's 2 guys in my gym named Oscar. 
You have got to start taking care of yourself. 
You're a wreck. 
I am fine. 
Jenna, that's a glue stick. 
You're going to the doctor. 
OK, great meeting. 
Let's try to have a calm week downstairs, shall we? 
Yes, I'm trying. 
I don't need any distractions. 
On Friday, Microwaves is announcing a very big project or, should I say, very little? 
The pocket microwave? 
You can buy it on Friday along with everyone else. 
It has a ham button. 
You used my idea! 
I understand what it's like having too much on your plate. 
Between medical practice and this job, I'm pulled in every direction. 
What can I do, doctor? 
Haven't been this tired since I was forced to do that dance marathon in Dubai. 
I can give you these pamphlets on stress and diet and doing a movie and a TV show at same time. 
But they're all gonna tell you that you need to give something up. 
And they're wrong. 
You can burn the candle at both ends. 
Go on. 
My lab works is in the field of sleep research. 
Mostly because I checked the wrong box on a form once. 
We are current working on a pill that keeps people awake under any circumstances. 
It's being funded by the U.S. Military and the WNBA. 
 Does it work? 
 It's kept my lab rats awake for days. 
 But we're looking for human subjects. 
 Where do I sign up? 
Please, we don't want a paper trail. 
Take 25 of these a day for the rest of your life. 
I am going to jury duty, but I will be right back. 
I got my princess Leia outfit, some Playgirl magazines from the early 1980s. 
They will dismiss me immediately as a weirdo. 
 Who's in charge while you're gone? 
 Let's see. 
Pete is spending spring break with his kids, so no one. 
No one here is in charge in any way. 
If no one's in charge, who will yell at me for goofing up the lunch order? 
We all will, Kenneth. 
We all will. 
You guys are my best friends. 
There you are! 
You wanna buy half a watch? 
I have to pay my fine in cash. 
I guess FCC stands for Federal Bunch of Sticklers. 
I hope you've learned a lesson from this. 
I sure have. 
I learned that if you pay some money afterwards, you can say whatever you want on TV. 
I can even say what Ernest Borgnine whispered to me at... 
Stop. That's not the lesson. 
That's always the lesson. 
If you have money, you can do whatever you want. 
Now I'm off to appear on Martha Stewart live. 
It's gonna be raunchy. 
Great news. 
I'm in the clinical trial for a military-grade anti-sleeping pill. 
Of course you are. 
Now I can still be on the show as much as you want and do the movie. 
Look how much energy I have. 
Come on, guys. I just have to go 
and get out of jury duty, and we can talk about all of this when I get back. 
I thought you left. 
Listen to me. 
I am not asking you this as the boss you love to undermine, but as the friend whose birthday you love to forget. 
Just be normal sauce for like two hours. 
Please. 
I will be right back. 
And I don't really think it's fair for me to be in a jury because I'm a hologram. 
You seem fine to me. 
Report to jury room B. 
Charles what now? 
The subject's unusually thirsty. 
Everyone shut up. 
Shut up, Lutz. 
 Where's Lemon? 
 She went to get out of jury duty. 
Can we get lunch from McDonald's? 
I need your creative input. 
I've spent the better part of last 3 years developing a portable, miniature microwave oven. 
Most of that time has been spent focused on coming up with a hip name for the product, that will appeal to the marketing holy trinity: college students, morbidly obese, and homosexuals. 
Unfortunately, legal just informed me that the name we settled on for our bite-size microwave, the bitenuker, is highly offensive to those who speak French or Dutch. 
A Franco-Dutchman would pronounce it "bet nyuker." 
Zat's awful. 
I'm sorry, miss Laroche-Van Der Hoot. 
This product rolls out in 2 days. 
We're in danger of losing the European market. 
Everyone here needs to brainstorm new names. 
Starting today, you are all members of the microwave division. 
 We should make tshirts! 
 Yes. And you're in charge of that. 
Remember, this isn't TGS, guys. 
Let's not shoot for the middle this time. 
Absolutely not. 
Excuse me, imperial guard, how long do these arson trials typically last? 
Couple of weeks, probably. 
You can drop the voice. 
This used to get me out of jury duty in Chicago all the time. 
This ain't Chicago, honey. 
Look at these people. 
Studio 6H. 
 It's Liz. 
 Where are you? 
The pig spoor has hit the wind spinner. 
Mr. Jordan cussed at Martha Stewart, 
Miss Maroney drank all the water out of the toilets. 
And I keep starting to sneeze, but nothing comes out. 
What? 
Does anyone there listen to me? 
It's not my fault. 
You didn't put anyone in charge. 
I've been put on a jury. 
I'll head up there as soon as we are dismissed for the day. 
Try not to let anything else bad happen. 
I'm in charge. 
Attention, everyone. 
All menstruating women go home immediately. 
He's been doing that for almost eight hours, Dr. Vicky. 
You know what I like to do for 8 hours? 
The TV guide crossword puzzle. 
Give me your hand. 
Now look into my eyes. 
Now let's try one where you're not... 
 clawing at the window. 
 I don't think so. 
This feels more natural. 
 You're saying, "give me your hand." 
 This is what my character would do. 
You're back. 
Guess I'm not in charge anymore. 
Guys? 
I've got a couple hours. 
 Where is everybody? 
 They're all dead. 
They're all dead unless they come up with a name for my pocket microwave. 
They're up in my office, where there are fewer... 
foosballs. 
So who's writing the show? 
Now that you're back, I thought you could do it yourself. 
How hard can it be? 
"Hey, I'm rapping Obama". 
"Welcome to another episode of robot/bear talk show". 
I'm Josh doing an impression of De Niro as an auctioneer. 
"Do I hear $1,000? 
Do I hear $1,000?" 
Really good! 
Jenna fills in time with a song. 
"Good night, good night". Mild applause. 
You'll be done in an hour. 
In the meantime, any ideas for microwave names? 
The small wonder. 
The micromate. The porta-hotty. 
If you're not going to take this seriously, then do your job. 
Write the show, and more important, deal with Tracy. 
How? That guy's got enough money 
to pay FCC fines for the next 200 years. 
Forget the fines. 
I've dealt with the FCC. 
And NBC is issuing an apology on Tracy's behalf. 
Your problem is your advertisers are pulling out. 
 My god. With no ads... 
 No ads, no TGS. 
No TGS... 
I see you self-publishing your novel and moving back in with your parents. 
I'll go talk to Tracy. 
Just catching up on some work. 
Really? 
What sounds more shocking? 
Or... 
Here you go. Everything's OK. 
No, just because you have money doesn't mean you can say whatever *** thing that you want. 
This has gotten bigger than you just paying fines. 
Our sponsors are pulling out because of you. 
And if we don't have advertisers, they're gonna pull the plug on TGS. 
Think about how you're hurting the crew. 
I don't want to hurt the crew. 
I love the crew. 
All we do is joke around together about our stupid boss, Liz Lem... 
Anyway, unless you know an advertiser that really wants to be associated with this, you need to stop. 
Great idea. 
Which part are you talking about? 
The first 2/3. 
I don't need to stop being myself if I am the advertiser. 
I have the money. 
I'll just buy up all the ads and let that hilarious Tracy Jordan character  do whatever he wants. 
 Put the phone down. You can't do that. 
 Jack won't let you. 
 We'll see about that. 
I need you to set up a meeting with you and the folks from ad sales. 
What do you mean you're not in charge anymore? 
Tracy Jordan from Tracyco called to invite you to a luncheon  celebrating their new ad campaign. 
 What... seriously, not now. 
All right, everyone, back to the drawing board. 
Legal rejected all of our ideas. 
Every names we came up with was offensive in some language. 
Including English. 
They knew what a Hot Richard was? 
So we're going to think outside the box a little bit here. 
I'm going to pick some random letters from this bag of Scrabble tiles. 
Let fate choose a name for us. 
Why don't we start over? 
I have an idea. Why don't I just 
pull them all at once? 
Why don't we take a break? 
Could you get Lemon on the phone for me, please? 
Ms. Gaulke, 
how long have you been an employee of Mailboxes Plus? 
I've been an assistant manager there for over seven years. 
And how would you describe the events that took place there on December 17th? 
The night of the fire. 
Christmas was always a very busy time at the store. 
Throw in a late Hanukkah and the fact that I work in a "Kwanzaa neighborhood", and it all made for a very stressful day. 
I sent Malik uptown for more 18-inch boxes, but he returned unrepentant with 12-inch ones. 
Christine was late, as well as Harry S. 
They said it was a problem with the subways, I suspect they were doing sex with each other. 
How many employees do you have, Ms. Gaulke? 
I supervise 12 employees, most of whom would be unemployable in any other field. 
They are selfish, irresponsible people who I know talk about me behind my back. 
They seem to think that their job is wasting my time and energy by making their every minuscule problem my personal responsibility. 
They don't care. 
And don't even get me started on Tracy and Jenna. 
And when the last one of them trundled off that night, I smelled the air, and I could feel that it was time. 
Time for a new beginning. 
And I knew that this was possible only through a cleansing fire. 
It would all have to burn. 
The packing peanuts, the delivery slips... 
All of it would dance in the warm mouth of my fire. 
And a new, better, wonderful me would rise from the ashes like a phoenix. 
Behold... 
the splendor of my beginning! 
I rest my case, your honor. 
Desperate times call for desperate measures. 
Underlings, I wanna hear your ideas. 
I knew this day would come. 
I have so much inside of me. 
My first idea is a movie that combines action and romance. 
Kenneth, you go. 
A name... 
for a pocket microwave oven. 
That's neat. 
A little microwave oven. 
So it's kinda like a funcooker. 
The Funcooker! 
It's snappy, fresh, and incapable of offending. 
Get legal on the phone. 
 I owe you one. 
 One hug, you mean? 
They're reading Mr. Jordan's apology 
if you want to watch it. 
"I regret any pain my words and actions may have caused. 
"I apologize to my family my fans, "and the American public. 
"Peace and love, Tracy Jordan." 
A heartfelt apology from a comedy icon. 
And we'll be right back. 
I do not apologize, America. 
I didn't even write that apology. 
I am advertiser Tracy Jordan, and I approve this message. 
I am an advertiser. 
I am an advertiser. 
Is that 30 seconds yet? 
Doesn't matter. 
We have The Funcooker. 
Hi, it's Liz. 
I should be able to get up there in an hour. 
Where are you rushing off to? 
Work? 
Not me. 
I'm gonna have a sandwich in my cell and take a nap. 
This man opens doors for me. 
I'm free. 
I'm freer than you. 
Freer than you. 
Professor Bananas is dead. 
Look, I know we're fighting, but I need to borrow your car. 
30 seconds. 
 How are you feeling, Miss? 
 Great. Alert. 
Is your vision steadily narrowing down to a pinpoint  as if darkness is closing in on you? 
 No, ma'am. 
Cast is set for robot/bear talk show. 
I'm back. 
What's going on? What have they done? 
Do we need to shut this down? 
Calm down. Everything's going 
to work out just fine. 
The show's about to begin, your sketch is adequate, and I've got The Funcooker. 
 What about the... 
 It's the bear and robot talk show. 
Jenna needs to sleep, or she's going to die! 
Which one of you is Jenna? 
Go to sleep! 
Sleep, Jenna! 
Sleep! It's for your own good. 
Don't fight me. 
 Sleep or die! 
 Hey, America. 
 Come on Tracy. Please cover for them. 
 Check out my funcooker. 
Did he just say funcooker? 
That's where I've heard that. 
Go to commercial! 
Go to commercial! 
Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan. 
My wife's throwing away some of our old towels. 
Do you want them? 
Cause they're out by the trashcans. 
Now that's got to be 30 seconds. 
Nine? 
Here comes the funcooker. 
I'll be with you in a minute. 
Could we get some diet slice and pita chips up in here? 
Bitenuker! 
9:00 A.M. Monday. 
Right? I'll be there with pants on. 
You're the best. 
Hi, girlfriend. 
Let's go out this weekend and talk about you. 
All I did was ask for a diet slice and some pita chips. 
Nice try. 
Now it's my turn. 
They're all terrified of you. 
That'll get you a week of good behavior. 
My containers. 
My new beginning. 
We've both had a rough week. 
You went firebug, and I'm sitting on four million... 
mini-microwaves that legal won't let out of the warehouse. 
I suggest we both go to our respective homes, open a bottle of wine, and heat up some ham in the shower. 
It works in the shower? 
You know what? 
This really is the best day ever. 
Here comes the funcooker! 
﻿1 Lemon. 
Do you know what the kidney does? 
Of course. I was a kidney 
in my fifth grade school play. 
 Oh, I'm a kidney  The other kidney is singing now. 
Milton needs a kidney. 
 Milton, as in your dad? 
 My dad? I don't know this guy. 
Professor Milton Greene, who's writing a three-volume biography of Jimmy Carter, and if I give him a kidney he could live to finish it. 
 So what're you gonna do? 
 I don't know. 
He's too old for the waiting list, since Giuliani left it's gotten tougher to harvest hobo organs. 
So it's up to me, and I don't want to be a match. 
It's too much. 
 Does that make me a bad person? 
 Of course not. 
This is really hard. 
I need your help. 
 The brain helps you make decisions  Okay. 
 And your colon pushes out...  
Okay, that's not helpful. 
Sorry. 
  Episode 322: Kidney Now! 
So, NBC is making me go on The Vontella Show to promote TGS. 
 Oh, that show is the worst. 
 I know. 
I swore I'd never go on again after that one time. 
We get paid to make each other laugh. 
Jenna, meet your half-sister Courtney! 
 Gimme my money, you bitch! 
 Never! 
They want me to go on as a relationship expert because of the "Dealbreakers" sketch. 
And since you're the face of "Dealbreakers",  you're going with me. 
 What? No, come on. 
I thought you wanted the attention. 
Yeah, but not like that. 
Remember the other time you were on? 
And I was all, like, "talk to the hand." 
Jenna, come on out. 
You give me back my money, bitch! 
Can't we just keep doing magazines? 
I will see you on Vontella, Liz. 
Now, kidney transplantation is no laughing matter. 
So, I apologize. 
Kidney's just such a funny word. 
How long is this going to take, Leo? 
Uh, well, this is the consent form for the test today. 
This is incorrect, doctor, I'm not giving him a kidney. 
It's the other way around. 
Oh, brother. 
Are you sure? 
If anyone is giving anyone a kidney at all. 
Who knows? 
You know what? 
I'll just remember that it's the opposite of what these say. 
I'd really be more comfortable if you rewrote the form. 
No, I'll remember. 
Opposite, opposite, opposite! 
Okay, but you're clear that he's giving a kidney to me. 
I really think you're jumping the gun here. 
We don't even know if we're a match, So you shouldn't assume that you're gonna get my kidney. 
No, of course. 
No, I'm sorry. 
It's just that without a kidney, I'm going to die. 
I think it's the hard k sound that's making me giggle. 
Kidney! 
Mr. Jordan, exciting news. 
Your old high school wants you to speak at graduation. 
And they said you could drop up to five f-bombs. 
 Not interested. 
 Why not? 
Because Frank Lucas High School was a hellhole. 
Grizz knows. 
He was there. 
A drug dealer named Campbell, he ruled that school. 
He wanted me to find a snitch called "Baby". 
Campbell wanted me to cut him open. 
Oh, my, that's very urban. 
I wouldn't do it. 
I dropped out. 
And I vowed never to go back to that place. 
"Campbell" was actually Mr. Campbell, 
his science teacher. 
His science teacher was a drug dealer? 
That's terrible. 
Science was my most favorite subject. 
Especially the old testament. 
He wasn't a drug dealer. 
Tracy dropped outta high school because Mr. Campbell 
wanted him to dissect a frog. 
Tracy couldn't do it; he cried in front of the whole class. 
It was bad. I had to deny 
ever being friends with him. 
Just like Peter did to Jesus in science. 
If your boyfriend calls out his brother's name during sex, that's a dealbreaker, ladies. 
That skit was crazy. 
That actually happened to Liz. 
Vontella don't care who Liz is. 
Jenna, we have a surprise for you. 
I swear to god, Courtney, I will rip your wig off. 
No, honey, Courtney's dead. 
You are gonna answer our audience's relationship questions! 
Yes! 
This guy I'm dating owns a tanning salon, but he won't let me tan for free, but he lets girls that he's friends with tan for free, so I go to this other tanning salon down the street to try not to make it a thing, but you know how there's no secrets in the tanning salon community, so what should I do? 
Um... 
I-I... 
I don't know. 
Liz? 
Oh, boy, well, whatever that just was, it's a dealbreaker because this guy is making you talk like a crazy person. 
You have sexually transmitted crazy mouth. Dealbreaker. 
My fiance and I keep arguing about our wedding plans, and... 
Nope, your fiance is gay. 
Look at him. 
Look at you. 
 Classic case of fruit blindness. 
 "Fruit blindness"? 
Sir, have you ever kissed a gentleman? 
Uh, one time in college. 
Yeah, and a lot since then. 
All right! 
My boyfriend has been acting really weird ever since he got promoted at his job... 
Yeah, he thinks he deserves a va jay jay upgrade. 
He doesn't. He's not Tom Brady. 
Shut it down. Dealbreaker. 
Yes, yes! 
Yeah, there's no such thing as bisexual. 
That's something they invented in the '90s to sell hair products. 
Dealbreaker. 
Only one snake in the bed. 
Dealbreaker. 
Yes. 
I think you guys are gonna make it. 
Mr. Jordan, 
I know Mr. Campbell 
wasn't a drug dealer. 
Yes, he was. 
 I know he was your science teacher. 
 No, he wasn't. 
And I know he didn't ask you to cut up "Baby",  He asked you to cut up a frog. 
 What frog? 
And I know you couldn't do it, and you cried. 
 When have I ever cried? 
 And that's why you left school,  because you were ashamed. 
 It's true! There is no "Baby"! 
I was chicken! I was chicken! 
A guy crying about a chicken and a baby? 
I thought this was a comedy show. 
Listen, you know how I can get to Jack Donaghy's office? 
Uh, yes, sir. 52nd floor. 
Mr. Jordan, I understand 
how hard that must've been, but it was so long ago. 
You can't understand, Ken. 
Where I come from, street cred is everything. 
That's why when I left that school in shame, I vowed never to cry again. 
And I never have! 
Um... 
Don't die! 
I love you, Jack! 
I want diet slice and some pita chips. 
I don't wanna be here! 
I don't like it here! 
I was just callin' y'all a bunch of racists. 
We're not really best friends, we're just good friends. 
I was chicken! 
I was chicken! 
I'm never going back to Frank Lucas High School to be reminded of my greatest failure. 
Mr. Jordan, 
I think it's sad that you're still ashamed of that kid. 
That kid is you. 
Uh-uh. I've changed, Ken. 
Into a badass adult. 
I have a wolf dog, I have two bad knees, And a gun. 
That I lost! 
Milton, are you going somewhere? 
I have to get back to Bennington. 
I owe my publishers a chapter of From Peanut to President. 
But before I go, I think we should talk about the other day. 
Milton, the Donaghys do not talk. 
We let things fester until they erupt in inappropriate anger, preferably during a wedding or elementary school graduation. 
Well, the Greenes are talkers and huggers. 
I'm sorry, Jack. 
I should never have put you in this position. 
Or this one. 
Look, I don't want a kidney from you. 
All I want is to make up for lost time. 
Can I come back next week? 
Sure, okay. 
We can go to a Yankee game. 
I have great seats. 
In the section between the players' wives and the players' mistresses. 
But I don't go on bat day. 
So, my son likes baseball. 
You know, there's a great sports memorabilia store on Third Avenue. 
Remember Carlton Fisk's home run in the '75 series? 
That's this ball? 
No, that's a ball he fouled off in the third inning. 
Huh. 
No, I want you to have it. 
Milton, that's too generous. 
No, I insist. 
For bringing me into your life. 
I-I-I can't. 
Jack. 
We're having a catch. 
Don't ruin it, Milton. 
Just like Jimmy and Chip Carter. 
Did you hear what I said? 
 This is great. 
Ooh! 
Damn, Ken, you know who that was? 
I don't, sir, do you? 
I grew up with that guy. 
He was the baddest gangster in my class. 
We called him "Mean Steve", but his real name was Steven Killer. 
Does seeing him in this menial job make you think about anything? 
Well, if a badass O.G. Like that 
could get stuck deliverin' food, how did I get out? 
Because you're not a bad-bleep O.G. 
You're a sensitive artist. 
You're different. 
And isn't that a message those kids at your old high school should hear? 
You're right, Ken. 
They should. 
Five f-bombs, right? 
Hello. 
Jack, it's Leo. 
I got the, uh, results of your blood work back. 
Right, yes, and? 
Well, "cytotoxic cross match of target HLA resulted in lyses of cells." 
Now, Jack, in layman's terms, what do you think that means? 
I don't know. Could I give 
this guy a kidney or not? 
"Due to negative blood tissue match, transplantation is not recommended." 
Damn it, is this written in Greek? 
It means we're not a match. 
Oh. Sorry. 
I was really looking forward to putting your father's kidney in you. 
The other way around, Leo. 
That's not what these forms say. 
Lemon. 
I'm getting Milton Greene a kidney. 
 You're a match? 
No, I'm not. 
Then where are you gonna get a kidney from? 
I don't know, but I have the entire liberal media establishment at my disposal. 
The same manipulation machine that got people to vote for Barack Obama and donate all that money after rainstorm Katrina. 
I'm going to use that to find my dad a kidney. 
You should do a celebrity concert. 
Like that gay guy did to benefit old gays. 
Yes, a benefit concert like "We are the World" or "Weird Al" Yankovic's less successful parody benefit "We are the Pizza". 
Tell Pete to start building a set. 
Wait a minute, we have to do this? 
Well, you found a way to do your day job and be on Vontella... 
a great job, by the way. 
I haven't seen that many riled-up dirtbags since CVS put the cold medicine behind the counter. 
Well, they want me to go back on Vontella, actually, but I'm not sure I'm qualified to give relationship advice. 
You're not. 
Suburban seventh graders have more sexual experience than you do, but that doesn't matter. 
 Right, because I'm helping people. 
 No, you're helping yourself. 
So make the most of this opportunity. 
After all, how many years does TGS have left? 
I don't know. 20? 
 What do you think this is, Wings? 
You've got two more years, at best. 
Lemon, This is what I've been trying to tell you since I first met you. 
Life is short. You've gotta 
get out there and get yours. 
"Get yours". 
I like that. 
Can I use that as one of my catch phrases? 
Sorry, Leo Spaceman's using it as the title of his new sex book for couples. 
Ooh. Ooh. 
Mary. 
Uh, Elvis. 
Mr. Aiken. 
Thank you all for coming here on such short notice. 
No problem, I just had my driver drop me off. 
So how come I saw you getting off the subway? 
What were you doin' down there? 
Uh, okay. 
I asked the three of you to be here because you are all deeply committed to charity work. 
My Mary J. Blige Foundation 
is celebrating its tenth year of searching for the Loch Ness monster. 
Well, musicians have banded together before to solve... 
All kinds of problems. 
World hunger, the collapse of the American farm, global warming, and uh, you're over 3 guys. 
I am disappointed and, in us as a group. 
How about a problem you can solve? 
One song, one man, one kidney. 
Let me get this straight. 
You want us to do a charity concert for one guy? 
Elvis, haven't you said that if a song reaches just one person, you've done your job? 
No, I've never said that. 
Fine. Listen, the man who 
needs the kidney is my father. 
We just met, and I don't want to lose him before I get a chance to know him. 
Please, I'm asking for your help. 
Okay, let's cut to the chase. 
M.J., you owe me. 
Who got you out of a 20-year exclusive performance contract at Sea World? 
Aiken, your cousin Kenneth Parcell already promised me you'd do this. 
And Elvis, or should I say, Declan McManus, international art thief? 
Okay, Jack Dona-you-tumbled-me. 
We'll do it. 
Also, you have a ton of interview requests. 
And they want you on the seventh hour of The Today Show tomorrow morning. 
Tell them all yes. 
I'm getting mine, Cerie. 
Also, Pete and Tracy's wives are in your office. 
Paula is Pete's wife, and Angie is the black one... 
Okay, Cerie, I got it. 
Dr. Liz, we need some advice 
from the dealbreaker lady. 
I don't know if that's a good idea. 
I know you, and I know your husbands... 
I just found out Tracy has a secret credit card I didn't know anything about. 
Not on my watch, biatch. 
And he's been using that credit card to pay for a hotel room here in New York two days a week. 
As that did. 
Shut it down. Dealbreaker. 
Paula. 
Pete is refusing to drive to my parents' place for just two weeks of family vacation. 
No to the way to the Jose. 
But Paula, talk it out before you walk it out. 
And I'm here in New York while he's back in Hooglanderveen. 
Long distance is the wrong distance, Sue. 
Dealbreaker. 
Mickey Rourke wants to take me camping. 
Dealbreaker, Jenna! God! 
I haven't seen my fiance in seven months. 
Cerie, I have two words for you. 
Robot warning. 
Okay, that catch phrase needs a little work. 
Dealbreaker! 
Teach it like ya preach it, Liz Lemon! 
I almost didn't make it here this afternoon. 
But then a very special friend of mine showed me the way. 
So I'd like to take a moment to thank Victor Cordova from the Sunoco Station on Lennox Avenue. 
But there's another reason why I almost didn't come today. 
Fear. 
Fear of letting people know the real me. 
I have but one thing to say to all of you. 
Be yourself. 
And I'm talkin' to you clearly, gay kid. 
Who told? 
And you, white kid just tryin' to go unnoticed. 
 Aw, come on. 
 Just be yourself. 
And I guarantee you every single person in this room will one day be president of the United States. 
Thank you. 
Tracy, before you go, I have a special surprise for you. 
Okay, but I'm allergic to horses. 
It is my pleasure to award you this honorary diploma. 
Congratulations. 
Take a breath, Mr. Jordan. 
Aah! 
Aah! 
Who wants my autograph? Aah! 
So you can see how important this is to me. 
 Are you in? 
 I'm in. I think it'll be fun. 
I actually played a kidney in my fifth grade school play. 
With this loser... 
I'm in, but when Costello's not lookin' I'm gonna punch him in the back of the head. 
Fair enough. 
Hey, Jack, Are you doing my musical benefit idea? 
 Because I'd love to be... 
 Uh, no, it didn't work out. 
Jenna, you know my European friends Uh, Rokus and, uh, Shandelay. 
 Alloo. 
 Please to meet. 
Thank you. 
Cerie, I'm going out for a couple hours. 
Okay. I'll just, uh... 
I'm meeting a book agent about writing a Dealbreaker book. 
He's gonna take me to lunch wherever I wanna go. 
Do you know if there's a sit-down Quizno's in midtown? 
Never mind. 
Liz Lemon, you dumb bitch. 
What? 
Here's the reason I don't wanna go on that family vacation: It's a working farm. 
And I'm the only one whose hands are big enough to guide the bull during mating. 
 Yeah, well, dealbreaker... 
 Shut up. 
There you are, you stupid cracker. 
You know why I get a hotel room? 
To poop in peace. 
No kids bangin' on the door, No phones ringin'. 
It's my time! 
Every Tuesday and Thursday at 3:00 pm! 
I don't know why I only go twice a week. 
That's what Angie should be worried about! 
You've gotta stop giving advice. 
You don't know what you're talking about. 
No, I'm not stopping. 
I'm gonna write a book. 
I have to! 
This is my next step! 
What're you talking about? 
This job isn't gonna last forever, Pete. 
TGS has two years left, tops. 
Pete, how'm I gonna live? 
I only have $300 million. 
This... this is crazy, Jack. 
I've never seen anything like this. 
And I was at "We are the pizza." 
Well, I thought I had to do something. 
Once I found that I wasn't a match, I felt like I'd let you down. 
You couldn't let me down, Jack. 
  Get a room. 
 Yeah, get a room. 
High school graduate. 
Do you know what this means, Grizz, Dotcom, Ken? 
We're goin' to college! 
And so began the craziest summer of my life. 
How'd you say that without movin' your mouth? 
Say what? 
Lemon, how are you? 
You know what? 
I'm good. 
I've got a book deal, a free sandwich in my pocket, and I have this weird, loose feeling in my shoulders. 
What is that? 
It's either happiness or osteoporosis. 
I think it's happiness. 
You're getting yours. 
Jack, what have you done? 
I called in every favor I had. 
He's my dad, Liz. 
Oh, my god, Sheryl Crow! 
We were best friends in elementary school! 
 Hi, Sheryl! 
 We're live in three... 
 Two... 
 I'll talk to her later. 
 Sometimes life brings pain and strife   And all seems wrong   That is when you find a friend   And write a song   So give the gift of giving   Give it far and give it wide   Take the leap   Reach down deep inside   And just give a kidney   To a father or a dad   Just give a kidney   Oh   We hear it doesn't really hurt that bad   And we know you'll want to give it   To a super human being   So get it done   We just need one   For Milton Greene   This country has 600 million kidneys   And we really only need half   That leaves about 300 million kidneys   Do the math   Oh, Milton Greene, Milton Greene, Milton Greene   Milton Greene, Milton Greene   He needs a kidney   Milton Greene, don't ask why   He could die if you don't call today  Listen, when someone starts talking in the middle of a song, You know it's serious. 
So give Milton a kidney. 
We all believe in this cause so much That we're doin' it for free. 
Except for Sheryl. 
That's right, I'm the only one gettin' paid. 
And only three of us are drunk. 
Milton Greene needs a kidney. 
Just like I need this beard. 
You don't wanna know what's under here. 
And while you don't have two beards, You do have two kidneys. 
Think of it this way, if I had $2, I'd give you one, wouldn't I? 
I'm one of the drunk ones. 
 They say that two is better than one   But sometimes one is better than two   If you had two heads, you'd wish you had one   How is this different?  
 If you had two dogs attackin' you   You'd want just one   There, we proved our point   Oh, Milton Greene, Milton Greene, Milton Greene   Milton Greene, Milton Greene   He needs a kidney   Milton Greene, don't ask why   He could die if you don't call today   He needs a kidney   No, he doesn't need a hand   He just needs a kidney   A hand would be an even harder thing to give   When you give a kidney  We sure had quite a year. 
What're you talking about? 
It's May. 
Shh. 
 Do some good   We pass the cup   They stitch it up   You do some good   Yeah, yeah   We pass the cup   They stitch it up   You do some good   Oh, yeah  Captioning by captionmax Yeah, that's good. 
Okay. 
Now,you're all here because you've been suspended om work for sexual harassment. 
But through this seminar, You will learn the skills to keep you from making the same kinds of mistakes that got you here. 
Excuse me,mr. 
Winerslav It's pronounced "weener-slave." 
okay,jeffrey. 
Is there anything I can do to speed this process up so I can just I'm afraid not. 
But someone who's in a rush to get back to work? 
That's somethin' you don't see every day. 
Now,that is an example of a very appropriate and very,very funny joke. 
Jenna, I need to speak with you. 
Jack,i did not hit that asian page. 
I was just swinging my arm and she walked into me. Twice. 
Jenna,it's not about that. 
It's about your sheinhardt-universal janis joplin biopic. 
Wait. We can call her janis joplin? 
We got the life rights? It's 
not janie jimplin anymore? 
Apparently, neither name cleared. 
It looks like your character's going to be called jackie jormp-jomp. 
 Oh,okay. So what's the good news? 
 I didn't say there was any. 
Sheinhardt-universal did some focus testing this week. 
 We got 100? 
 You're holding that upsiddown. 
 Oh,no. 
 Yes. I was afraid of this. 
It turns out not having the life rights or any janis joplin songs was a negative for audiences. 
But what about my duet with jimi hendrickson at woodstocks? 
We're all here at woodstocks someday there will be a black president uh,jenna, Sheinhdtniversal does not wanna release the picture. 
And how will that affect my oscar chances? 
Adversely. Unless we get 
independent distribution. 
To do that, "sing dem blues,white girl: "the jackie jormp-jomp story" has gotta get some buzz. 
I'm gonna need your help for that. 
Do you need a sex tape released? 'Cause I got a wrdne. 
It's night vision and you can see that his buddy is robbing me. 
No,jenna,i want you on the pr warpath. 
If there's a red carpet,i want you on it talking up the movie starting monday. 
The kids' choice awards? Fine. 
I'll set aside my feud with raven simone for one day. 
But she knows what she did.

30 Rock Season03 Episode18 Miss lemon,you aren't supposed to be here. 
You're on s-e-x probation. 
Yeah,i know,i just wanted to stop by and check in. 
Kenneth,stop. I just want 
a script or a rundown,okay? 
Put that down. You 
give that to me,kenneth. 
Did you hear what I said? 
Mr. Donaghy,help! Rule breaking! 
This is sad. 
Lemon,come with me. 
Lemon,you know you're supposed to go home after your pervert seminars. 
I'm going. I just hate not being here. 
 You have to rehearse! 
 No! Passive resistance! 
I learned that from dr. King! I'm brave! 
 You sure you miss this? 
 Yes. 
As crazy and stressful as this place is, not being here is worse. 
I feel for you. 
Remember that time I came back from the world economic forum with mono And missed a week of work and I wanted to pull my hair out but I couldn't because it's too thick? 
People like us, we need the stress. 
We're only happy when we're overcoming obstacles. 
You take that away, we start bouncing off the walls, spend our days jabbering at doormen. 
Hey,i brighten their day. 
Before I go,can I at least find out what frank's hat says? 
 "constant cving." 
 He could do better. 
Has anyone looked at this sexual harassment stuff they gave us? 
I don't need to read it. 
The whole thing is loosely based on a evening I spent with isiah thomas. 
No wonder liz got busted. 
According to this, you can't do anything without it being considered harassment. 
Did you know you have to report in-office relationships? 
 Is that true? 
 It's the first thing listed. 
Have you read this? 
Well,i wanted to, because it's full of rules, but ms.Vieira made me throw it away. 
And said pretty boys like me shouldn't be filling their heads with ideas. 
 Hi,frank. 
 Hello. 
Coworker. 
Ms.vieira... 
Of course my job is annoying, but that doesn't mean I don't love it. 
I'm sure your job can be annoying. 
Not all the tenants are as fun as me. 
I get it. 
Hey,would you mind if brought a chair down here? 
Yes,my job is stressful. Very stressful. 
But in the end,i get paid to make people laugh. 
We have a saying that laughter is the best medicine, so I'm kind of like a doctor here. 
Like you were,in poland. 
We have a show tonight. 
I've never missed a show. 
Not even the time I had that virus they kept saying only raccoons get. 
I can't believe I'm not there. 
Hey,I've-- uh,I've picked up some polish from you guys. 
****** It's kinda cold out for a jog. 
 Oh,I'm just going downstairs to the fitness center. 
 What? This building has a gym? 
Yeah,it'the door right next to the vending machines. 
Vending machines? What kind? 
I don't know,sorry. I'm emily. 
Are you new to the building? 
No,I'm liz. I've lived 
here for four years. 
I usually work crazy,long hours, but I'm on leave right now for normal reasons. 
 And you're feeling a little lost. 
 I am. 
Right now,i should be standing in a toilet stall so nobody bothers me while I eat lunch. 
God,i miss it. 
I was an investment banker for 15 years. 
80-hour workweeks, corner office, secret candy drawer... 
A a decoy candy drawer to throw others off the trail? 
Smart. 
The point is you get addicted to the stress. 
Think it gives your life purpose. 
 And then when you stop  for normal reasons... 
You see how stupid you were. 
It just takes time to realize there are much better ways to be happy. 
Wait for me... Lady. 
Kenneth, what can I do for ya? 
Well,sir, I recently learned that company policy requires That employees disclose their relationships with their cowkers to their immediate supervisor. 
I am not kyo there are perhaps 40 people between us. 
Pete,for instance. 
Oh,i just don't trust mr. Hornberger,sir. 
He has a ridge on the section of the skull associated with deviousness. 
Okay. So there's a girl. 
Yes,sir. Her name is daphne. 
She's one of thetgsdancers. 
And when I watch her dance, my heart skips a beat. 
And not because of my acute ventralitis. 
Wait. You're dating one of the dancers? 
Oh,no,sir. 
I actually haven't spoken to her yet, but I have a long-term plan to marry her, And I wanted the company to be aware of my intentions. 
I see. I'll be sure to mention 
that at the next board meeting. 
Thank you,sir. 
Oh,also, I don't know if this is harassment, But someone atthe today show made me eat an unripe bana in front of her. 
Hey,ken. Do you know who 
our immediate supervisor is? 
I will not be able to attend your wedding. 
Because of a prior conflict. 
Oh,what's the special occasion? 
Weekday. 
w,so this is normal? 
This is,like,your version of sweatpants and pop-tarts? 
Not too shabs. 
Short for shabby. Hilarious. 
This could be your life too,liz. 
Just short the housing market. 
Or write a cookbook specifically for mixed-race children. 
Or marry a rich, old dude who dies. 
Clive,i wanna say? 
Or have mild lupus and great insurance. 
So,here is the plan for today. 
 Start with facials and massages... 
 Yes,please. 
Then private shopping at bergdorf,  swing by the dermatologist for a tune-up. - Fabulous. 
Dinner at jewel bako, then a nightcap back here. 
Wow,that is a plan. 
But,uh,i don't think I should go. 
Oh,liz is still stressed about her old job. 
It's just-- it's friday,and at my job that is our biggest day. 
I don't think i'd be good company. 
But thank you for inviting me. I'll have one drink here. 
Have two. 
But then I really should go home, 'cause i,you know I'm still in work mode, I'm not really in spa/shopping mode. 
I wouldn't be able to enjoy myself. 
And I don't wanna crash your day together and ruin it. 
 We're always together. 
 Thank you. 
Cocktails. 
It's just so stressful thinking aut my employees trying to do everything without me. 
 Those look great on you. 
 Then I'm buying them. 
I guess I'm just one of those people that needs work. 
You know,i thrive there.I 
 and it's gone just like that? 
 Just like that. 
 Thank you,dr. Binderman. 
 *** My point is,you are so sweet to include me. 
Believe me,I'm jealous, but today's just not the day. 
So,you know,i'll hang out with you guys for a little bit, and i'll have my one drink,and... 
 What time is it? 
 Almost midnight. 
If we're gonna get up in time for our mani/pedis, we really should turn in. 
Bye. 
I forgot to watch my show. 
I'm prepared to do a nipple slip if you need it. 
Just talk about the movie. 
Hi,I'm ethan fromnick magazine. 
 Whose mom are you? 
 Thank you. Well,tonight's about fun. 
I'm wearing taylor dayne for express, and my peace sign,of course,  Is a nod to janis joplin, who,I'm so-- - dora the explorer's backpack! 
Backpack, is map in you tonight? 
here are your lunches, gentlemen. 
Dotcom,i forgot to get you extra mustard. 
All right,enough! 
This fighting stops now! 
I asorry. Mr. Slattery hurt 
me, and now I'm hurting him. 
He'll never get mustard. 
Except for the mustard that comes with the sandwich. 
I said I was sorry,ken. 
I didn't even mean to hurt you. 
Oh,really? I love you too,dotcom. 
 I didn't say  I knew this would happen someday. 
A woman would come between us. 
Well,I'm not standing by. I'm taking action. 
Oh,sir,before miss lemon left,i promised her I wouldn't let you start any adventures. 
Yeah,well, liz lemon's in jail now. 
And somebody has to step up and take charge around here. 
Let the problem solving begin. 
Are you daphne? Yeah,you're fired. 
First a backpack upstages me, then the paparazzi kept calling me dina lohan, And now the cyrus family has decided to rock a bunch ofunky hats. 
You can't give up now. 
Did jackie jormp-jomp give up when those vampires attacked woodstocks? 
Nobody even knows I'm here. 
From dreamworks's upcoming feature film on top of spaghetti, helen mirren. 
Good evening. 
And now we take a moment oh,that's horrible. 
You got me. 
And now we take a moment to remember those we lost this year in the kid entertainment industry. 
****** R****** E****** J****** Was that me? 
Did they just say I'm dead? 
I thought you spoke to the producers. 
Look,connor,if we don't get some traction, jenna maroney's picture's dead. 
 We need your help. 
 Maroney. Picture. Dead. Got it. 
This is a disaster. 
No,no. We hit the jackpot. 
You being dead is the best thing that ever happened to this movie. 
 Jenna. I wanna tupac you. 
 Fine. But I have to pee first. 
No. No,no,no, tupac shakur,the rapper. 
He sold ten times more albums when he was dead than when he was alive. 
That's what we're going to do with this movie. 
Die young,become a legend. Just like janis. 
Or rusty,the bear fromthe magicals. 
Yes. Now... You just need to 
stay dead while I sell the movie. 
Oh,i can play dead. 
I watched my whole church group get eaten by a bear. 
Congratulations,miss lemon. 
You've completed your sensitivity traing. 
Your suspension is up, and here is your certificate. 
Wow,so I can go back to work tomorrow? 
That's soon. 
Well,i know how eager you are to return to work. 
I guess so. 
But coming back to work isn't always easy. 
Work means stress. 
And stress can make you fall back on old behavior. 
So tonight, I want you to really think about th d back. 
Visualize everything that's facing you. 
Think about walking through that door and immediately dealing with 100 different problems and responsibilities. 
Your coworkers' demands on you, the long hours, the pointless meetings and endless phone calls. 
Think of the frustration, the futility, and the time That you will never get back as you creep closer and closer to the grave. 
Okay. Any questions for me? 
Just one. 
Why don't you drop those dockers and gimme a piece of that sweet ass? 
 What're we doing today,ladies? 
 More of the same. 
 Chello?  Lemon,what the hell 
happened at your reinstatement hearing? 
Jeffrey weener-slave said you put your fingers in his mouth. 
Did i? Or did he put 
his mouth on my fingers? 
It's gonna take at least six weeks paid leave to g to the bottom of this. 
I'm very busy right now faking jenna's death to sell her movie. 
I'm not going to engage on that. Mantra. 
But I am calling h.r.and getting 
you back for the next show. 
No,i just-- I need a little more time off. I'm on humanity leave. 
Good god,what indigo girls song is that from? 
Syllabus of usoff vagabonds,martyrs,and quilts. 
The point is I have met the most amazing group of women,jack. 
They just live. 
And they spin every morning, and they go to museums. 
 Lemon,you are not a rich divorcee. 
 I know. 
But I have some money saved-- enough for two years. 
Maybe four if I give up cable. 
So I will me back to the show in four years. 
You're fooling yourself. You 
know you can't live like that. 
Yes,i can. Emily and 
her friends are happy. 
Believe me,there is no solace in their luxury. 
Only deep despair. 
How do you know all these indigo girls songs? 
Listen,you are wrong about emily. 
Oh,god,there's a spider nest in my yo mat! 
Mr. Jordan. Mr. Jordan,what did you do? 
You fired daphne? 
I had to. 
Friendship and trust in the entourage is the most important thing. 
Like that hbo show. John adams. 
 Well,me and dotcom are back to being best friends.  We were never 
but the other dancers are refusing to come to work out of solidarity with daphne. 
Usually,this is the point in my process when liz lemon steps in and takes care of everything. 
Heavy is the head that eats the crayons. 
I'm gonna take a nap. 
See you in ten hours. 
Kenneth. Have any of the 
dancers come in yet today? 
Pete. A word. 
 Jenna's dead. 
 I don't feel anything. 
 What's wrong with me? 
 No,no, it's a marketing ploy. For her new movie. 
But it mns you won't have her for the show on friday. 
And you need to put together some sort of on-air tribute. 
We actually already have an obituary reel for jenna. 
We put it together after she cheated on that mobster. 
That's good. 
Oh,eating right, working out,sleeping... 
Bm-ing like a rock star? 
All right,all right. What's 
the hump day schedule look like? 
Oh,it's esy, liz,it's thursday. 
I read somewhere it's tuesday. 
Mr. Jordan,it's friday. We really need to 
tell mr. Hornberger that the dancers quit. 
No we don't. He's not even 
gonna notice they're gone. 
 Oh,my. 
 These are the new dancers,kid. 
 Say hi to velvet. 
 Hello,miss velvet. 
Just think,an hour ago they were brawling in a parking lot, But tonight, they're gonna be stars. 
Show ken here what we worked on. 
Oh,boy. 
Oh,boy, I am really starting to feel the benefits of massages and yoga five days a week. 
Check this out. 
Look at you. 
Last week you were flipping out about missing work. 
Oh,no,that's old liz. 
My boss kept trying to tell me that I would go crazy living a life of leisure,That it's unhe well,he's actually right. 
No,no,he's not,emily. 
No,i used to be a neurosurgeon before jasmine guy and I wrote our cookbook, And the human brain needs stimulation or it atrophies. 
And your pleasure center literally shrinks. 
That's why we do our special activity. 
To combat that. 
What,like,sudoku? 
uh,we did a games night for a couple of weeks. Didn't last. 
So charity work? 
No,charity work sucks. 
 Should we tell her? 
 Erin,it's too soon. 
 Punch me in the face,liz. 
 I'm sorry,what? 
You heard me.Punch 
me as hard as you can, and then I am coming at you like an animal. 
Oh,god, is this a fight club? 
The pain provese're alive. 
Oh,this is very dispointing! 
Come on,hit me. Get a taste. 
I brought a roll of quarters to hold in my fist. 
Oh,god. Jack was right. 
Oh,i have to get back to my show. 
 I need the show. 
 You want out,liz? 
You're gonna have to fight your way out. 
As we celebrate the life of jenna maroney... 
The coast guard won't officially declare her dead yet, but what the pirates did to that boat! 
Well,it's a very generous offer. We'll be in touch. 
Jenna,what the hell are you doing here? 
They're talking about me. 
I'm really better today. 
So's the laundry, ******* that was some of jenna maroney's earlier work. 
It's hard to believe that both of those women outlived her. 
Especially the woman on the right. 
We'll be right back. 
A coupla gay guys were crying. 
Oh,jack,thiss just the greatest night of my What the hell is that? 
Well,it's you. What's the problem? 
It has the year I was born on it. 
Therealyear, not the actress year. 
Now almost a million people are gonna know that I'm f f  It's too late to change it,jack. 
 Jenna,calm down. 
I'm selling the movie in the next 12 hours. Your movie. 
Think about what matters here. 
In five,four,three... 
And finally tonight, what more fitting way to say good-bye to our friend than with the gifts she gave all of us... 
Her music. 
Ladies and gentlemen, itzhak bemelmans and the tracy jordan dancers. 
Gimme me a microphone. 
* Whole grain,low fat I know you want a piece of that * but I just wanna dance still alive.Not yet 32. 
Sorry,jack. Worth it. 
 I'm back. 
 What did it turn out to be? Lesbians? 
No. Fight club. 
this this is a disaster. 
* But I'm just here to dance what is wrong with you two? 
You guys mess up everything you touch, and then I have to come in here and fix it. 
 I am so mad. 
 Why are you smiling? 
You're freaking me out. 
Oh,you two troublemakers. Come here! 
 She's gonna do something to us. 
 You're crazy! 
I'm back,nerds. 
Liz, did you hear? 
Yeah, is your brother Gonna be okay? 
Oh, no, not that. 
A new movie about janis joplin Is going into production. 
And sheinhdt-universal Is making it.

But i'm also so excited. 
Hey, max, is this Your baby sister?

Omg, liz. 
Look at you and me And our biological clocks. 
You're going baby crazy And i keep getting turned On by car accidents. 
I'm not baby crazy, jenna. 
This whole adoption thing Is just taking a lot longer Than i thought. 
Where did you get That little shoe? 
It isn't stealing If it fell on the ground. 
So, uh, that's the tour, Elisa. 
I think you'll find being My mother's nurse a mixed bag. 
When she's in a foul mood, It can be horribly unpleasant. 
But at other times, She is...asleep. 
I understand. 
Elder care can be stressful. 
Uh, especially when The object of that care Wanders around at night In depression-era petty pants. 
You should've seen my Grandmother in her later years. 
Do you know What kind of clothes Old puerto rican ladies Wear around the house? 
No. 
Me neither 'cause She never wore any. 
But family is family. 
And you're a good son.

I don't want to spend So much. 
I have to. 
I'm afraid angie Will divorce me If i ever have enough money For her to live off of half. 
So before she can get, I have to spend it all On useless things Like gold shoes And grizz and dotcom. 
Well, she's not gonna get Half your money, tracy.

I don't got a pre-nup! 
When angie and i Got married, My only assets were A toaster oven and two tickets To a young mc concert.

I mean, she should audition For me. 
But i'm me now actually. 
I'm going train wreck aside, I love this idea.

By putting a tv actress Into the movie world We can promote both. 
It's like we're including A heroes dvd With missile guidance system We sell. 
 i'll call the studio.

I'm so glad that I time-traveled here from 1969. 
Whoa, what is that iron bird? 
They had airplanes In the '60s, jenna. 
Oh, right. 
Boy, i feel like I've just been talking nonstop. 
No, you also ate quite a bit. 
It's my fault for wanting To hear all about your job. 
It's just so much more Interesting than the u.n. 
Oh, come on, really? 
You got all the different Languages and the costumes. 
And that big meeting room. 
It must be like working in The galactic senate in star wars. 
They are similar. 
We are also very concerned about The growing influence Of the sith lords. 
Wow. 
Are you free for dinner Some night this week? 
Yeah, sure, i'd love it. 
Sounds great. 
Who was that? 
A guy that i met.

Oh, liz. 
I like him. 
He's smart. 
He's funny. 
He's got a job. 
 yay! 
 but you know what? 
I'm gonna screw this up. 
I always find a way To screw good things up, And this one Is a mine field. 
Did i mention that we met Because i thought he was a baby? 
He doesn't have to know that. 
He can't know that. 
But what if i say Something stupid Like order a tall coffee Or talk about my nintendo wii? 
Liz, you like this guy. 
You're a grown woman. 
Take a lesson from janis And show some self-control. 
How far into that biography Are you? 
Not very. 
Why? 
What happens? 
So let me get this straight. 
If i sign this And then tracy decides to run away With that chunky chick from hairspray Or any female Of equivalent thickness. 
Then i get $8,500? 
That's correct. 
Ugh. 
What do i care? 
I'll sign your stupid contract. 
Never gonna leave this man Anyway. 
You're not? 
Baby. 
I'm gonna be with you To the very end. 
I'm gonna watch you die, Tracy jordan. 
She's done it before, jack. 
Forget it! 
I know you're not Gonna leave me. 
I got somebody Who's gonna watch me die! 
Tracy, let's not get Emotional.

You could stay Or you could leave, But it's gonna take a while. 
Oh, yeah! 
Uh, liz, jenna got the lead In the janis joplin biopic That i'm co-producing. 
And i want her to open The next show With a song from the movie.

Have you learned how to say "do you want fries With that" in chinese? 
Ha! 
Jack donaghy, Ser vp for television And microwave oven programming. 
Stuart lagrange, U.n. High commission 
On water temperature and food taint.

 oh! 
I just want you all to know As i prepare to venture Into moviedom, That an actor is only As good as the words Oh, my thing is on. 
Everyone shut up. 
Shut your mouths. 
Breaking news now About a new janis joplin biopic. 
Julia roberts has agreed To play the tragic singer... 
What? 
In a film directed By martin scorse And written by the best Screenwriter in the world, Whoever that is. 
The announcement is a huge blow To a competing project From jenna moroney And steven spielberger. 
That's right. 
Spielberger. 
Here's moroney on a windy day. 
Don't turn it off, Ms. Moroney. 
They haven't shown that good news You were telling us about. 
'Cause that all seemed Like really bad news. 
It's 7:00. 
Why don't i hear my mother Yelling "go home" To the asian contestant On jeopardy? 
'Cause she's asleep. 
Really? 
How did you do that? 
She fought me at first, But i find that authoritative Rapid spanish subdues white people. 
Well, i'm heading out For the evening. 
Oh, i forgot. 
Somebody dropped that off For you earlier. 
Oh, good god. 
Oh, gold shoes. 
My nephew just joined The marines To try to pay for college, But that's fun. 
No, no, They're from tracy jordan. 
I tried to get him And his wife to sign a pre-nup, But all that led to were pledges Of everlasting love and devotion. 
Was ridiculous. 
What's ridiculous about love? 
Well, the idea of depending On one person For the rest of your live Is irrational. 
You come in alone, You go out alone. 
That's the saddest thing I ever heard. 
There's nothing sad about it At all, actually. 
I have a great life. 
Tonight i'm going out With a fox news correspondent. 
We'll have some dinner, Some laughs, some sex. 
Not necessarily In that order. 
But i'm not counting on spending The rest of my life with her. 
So what's your plan? 
Get old, die alone In an empty room With your gold shoes? 
That's what happens To most of us. 
At least i'm prepared. 
Without getting Into specifics, My exit involves A mcflurry machine And a video tape of Risque commercials from overseas. 
Well, i don't even know What to say to that. 
Except that in puerto rico, A mcflurry, it's called Asenor flurry. 
This guy makes badhushas. 
They're like an indian donut. 
They're amazing. 
Careful, buddy, it's hot!

Yes, i did, sir. 
Unbelievable. 
I knew i should've listened To my friends. 
Kofi said you were Too good to be true. 
Na ah Told me to wait three days Before i called you. 
And yet here we are. 
Was anything even going To happen between us tonight? 
No. 
But not because of your size. 
It's because i have a thing About intimacy. 
I'm the weird one. 
I'm weirder than you. 
 ??

That came out wrong. 
You came out wrong. 
Oh, and i lied About your show. 
I have seen it. 
Be careful crossing the The lady will be having The tasting menu But with some substitutions.

Of late. 
Socially inept and baby crazy. 
I feel like i'm In a beer commercial. 
Yeah, i get it. 
I'm a piece of work. 
But i really like you. 
And if you gave me Another chance, Maybe this could be something. 
Liz, at this point In my life, Maybe just isn't good enough. 
Okay, here's a thought. 
Did you see Thesex in the citymovie?

Comedy, music show, live show. 
Comedy, music, live.

I could tell you that we are the number one late night show among men 9-13 and the morbidly obese. 
I could tell you that we'ree.In final negotiations 
To create exclusive content for america's jails But i'm not the one being judged here.

Good night! 
This is tgs! 
So where's that conference room? 
 Oh. Golly. 
 Whoa, k. 
I am sorry, mr. Jordan. 
I'm just overworked. 
With my page duties and being mr. Donaghy's assistant, 
There's not enough hours in the day. 
I'm sorry about that. 
But just let me know if there's any way i can help. 
 Actually, there is one thing. 
 No. I was just saying that. 
Why can't you read human facial queues? 
All right, what is it? 
Well, with both these jobs, I don't know when i'm gonna be able to get home. 
I'm worried about my bird, sonny crockett. 
Would you mind going to my apent and feeding him? 
Yeah, okay. Birds are 
like little dinosaurs. 
So what i'll be doing is actually pretty cool and brave. 
Thank you, sir. 
Here are my keys. 
Oh, and one thing, don't go into my bedroom. 
 What? 
 Do not go into my bedroom. 
25%? How am i supposed 
to cut a quarter of our budget? 
Well, there is some fat. 
What about sid? 
Sid? I can't fire our announcer. 
He'll lose his insurance. 
You know, he has a lot of health problems. 
Yeah, because he was hit by lightning And can't really talk anymore. 
It's tergis with tracky ng-Jong And jimmy moop! 
No. Sid is off the table. 
I'm not firing any of my people. 
I'm not doing that to their families. 
Or in sid's case, their much younger wife With whom they have an open relationship. 
All right, we'll find the money somewhere else. 
 The food budget  No! 
All right, what about straws? 
We spend $1,200 a year on straws. 
Okay, fine. No mstraws. 
Everyone drinks from the can from now on. 
 Oh, no, we need straws. 
 Oh, god! That's its bathroom! 
Listen, liz, i'm gonna need your revised budget By the end of today. 
I don't know, brad. 
Tgs is a complicated machine. 
 Every part's important. 
 Get it. 
You don't want to be the bad guy. 
But if you don't make the cuts, i will. 
And i don't give a crap about anyone here. 
Matthew, i know this isn't ea But the company's facing cutbacks. 
And you have to admit your boom box division Is a little bit behind the times. 
We're not behind the times, we're groovy! 
I can offer you two weeks severance. 
Mr. Donaghy, i know you said only 
interrupt you If it was very important, But tashonda from time warner cable Is on the phone And she's offering three free months of showtime. 
But we have to act now. 
Kenneth, this does not qualify As something important. 
I do not want showtime. 
Oh, okay. 
I'm sorry. 
I just didn't want you to miss out On this exciting opportunity Thank you, kenneth. 
Take your time. 
Hey, little guy. 
don't go in the bedroom. 
 Don't go in the bedroom. 
 I wasn't going to! 
I wa't going to! Bye! 
Hello, miss lemon. 
Are you here to see kenneth the page Or kenneth the mr. Donaghy's assistant? 
Well, i need to see jack. 
Hello, miss lemon. 
Mr. Donaghy is in an important meeting. 
And i've been told not to interrupt him. 
What is this pertaining to? 
The tgs budget. 
Oh, my. That sounds very important. 
 Mr. Donaghy. 
 Kenneth! 
i've worked here 20 years. 
I was wrong. 
That was not important enough. 
It's me, kenneth the page, this job is hard. 
Please have a seat. 
Mr. Donaghy will be right with you. 
Do you know what these meetings are about? 
I hear people are getting fired. 
Yeah. I don't know. 
 Do you know jack donaghy well? 
 Pretty well. 
Do you happen to know If he's a boob man or a butt man? 
 What? Why wouou ask that? 
 Because i don't want to get fired. 
So i'm gonna have to go in there And boink my way out of this I'm cheryl, by the way. 
You're gonna try to have sex with jack? 
I have to. 
I have 15 employees. 
I'm responsible for them. 
Do you have any idea what that's like? 
Well, yeah, i have 200 people under me, but Wow. Maybe we could team up, 
go in there together,  lez out, give him a show. 
 No. Cheryl, get a grip. 
Oh, boy. 
Miss lemon, mr. Donaghy 
will see you now. 
Make it quick, lemon. 
I'm in the middle of a very unpleasant day. 
Okay, well, so am i. 
I know this cutback stuff is difficult. 
I don't want to fire anyone. 
And i don't want to take anything away from my crew. 
And i want to keep making free, long-Distance prank calls To people like seattle's richard sacmuncher. 
And i think that's reasonable. 
So what do i do to get out of this? 
The only thing to do is make your cuts And live to fight another day. 
What? That's it? 
I thought you'd tell me to cook the numbers Or shred something or do some pelican brief stuff. 
Why is everyone talking about that movie? 
It's playing on showtime. 
Kenneth, get me showtime. 
What? Why now? 
I'm sorry. 
I know this is hard, but there's no way out of it. 
Well, little heads up, Your next meeting might disagree. 
She's planning to change your mind By hitting... 
 ...that. 
 Oh, no, not again. 
This last guy tried to take my belt off. 
But the sad thing is, it sometimes works. 
Sexual bartering pays off. 
Salome. Mata hari. 
Deborah norville. 
Well, good luck downstairs. 
I'm sure you'll figure it out. 
Oh, and one more thing, uh, don't cut the straw budget 'Cause i've already cut the exterminators. 
Jenna, something weird is going on. 
You mean this budget stuff? 
Don't worry about it, tracy. 
It's just gonna affect the non-Specials. 
No, it's not that. 
Jenna, you're the smartest person i know. 
You think kenneth could be a murderer? 
What? Why would you 
think that? 
Well, i might be crazy, But neither he nor his bird would let me into his bedroom. 
And why wouldn't you want to let tracy jordan Into your bedroom unless you got a bunch Of dead nurses in there? 
Well, i had to study serial killers To prepare for my role as criminal profiler Jill st. Ferrari 
in the lifetime original miniseries Hushed rapings. 
And all masked murderers share three characteristics: Cruelty to animals... 
 He grew up killing pigs! 
 Bedwetting. 
No wonder he's fascinated when i do that! 
And an inability to read human facial queues! 
I admonished him for that earlier! 
Three for three. 
He's a monster! 
Okay, we've gotta go tell jack. 
You know, if kenneth is actually a killer, We're gonna be heroes. 
Liz, our food is gone. 
They took it. 
It happened this morning. 
Do you have a cookie? 
Mommy's baby needs his yum-Yums. 
Oh, my god. 
Sid, did you get fired? 
Good-Bye, lerz. 
 Liz, it's a massacre! 
 What is going on? 
Brad came in this morning and started making cuts. 
I can't go back to teaching high school math. 
Those girls pretend they're not women yet, But they are. 
 Do something, liz. 
 You're our only hope. 
Halster, you look hot in those trousers.

 How may i help you? 
 Um, we need to see jack. 
I don't know if i can allow that. 
I've made some mistakes lately. 
 Terrible mistakes. 
 UhHuh. 
So i need to know what this is about. 
I can't have you getting me into trouble. 
It's not about you. 
Yeah,t'out someone else.

 And what his name? 
 Kenneth. 
I mean--I'll tell you his name.

Excellent.  
I will be sure to let him know As soon as he's done firing steven lee from microwaves. 
What? 
Oh, mr. Lee, i forgot. 
He's ready for you now. 
I've got chills. 
He's evil. 
If i had any doubts out this before, and i don't think i did, they're gone now. 
We gotta go to his apartment and save who we can. 
We're defitely gonna be heroes.

Lee, i need that dress jenna wore for the hooker sketch, The heels tracy wears when he plays michelle obama, And doubleWait Triple spanx.

Thanks, liz. 
You're our hero. 
They may take my dignity, But they will never take our straws! 
Yeah! 
Oh, my god. 
Why does he have a rolled up towel Against the bottom of the door? 
It's so creepy! 
Jenna, i just want you to know that if we find Any human remains in there, I'm gonna throw up all over your face. 
Oh, no! 
Kenneth's a murderer and the riddler's coming! 
no. it's a bug bomb. 
get out. get out. 
 It's poisonous. Ah! 
 Ah! 
So thanks for dinner. 
 You sure know a lot about sushi. 
 Well, you gotta be careful. 
They try to up-Sell you the real crab. 
 So... 
 so... 
list, i gotta get going. 
i got a lotta work tomorrow. 
all right, listen, we're both adults here. 
We know the deal. 
Let's cut to the chase. 
That's certainly direct. 
We go upstairs.20 minutes. 
Open mouth.I will work your ears. 
I don't know, liz. What you're 
asking me to do is a big deal. 
If i go through with this, i need to know it's worth it. 
Fine. 30 minutes. 
I'll make some sounds. 
And you can say one weird thing to me. 
All right, hardball. 
30 minutes. sounds. 
Top front of my body is now in play. Deal? 
Deal. 
Lemon, i heard a rumor that you went out With one of the consultants last night. 
Well, i had no choice. 
I had to give him a little taste of the lemon. 
And it was not sour, my friend. Not sour. 
It's interesting you put it that way Because your writers' room is now the headquarters For telemundo's coverage of world cup soccer qualifying. 
Equador tiene que ganar o atar contra peru Para avanzar en los finales. 
 What the what?! 
 Ssh. 
Brad and i had a deal. 
I gave him top front. 
Top front? Good lord, lemon, 
that's your worst quadrant. 
Kenneth, you know how you told tracy Not to into your bedroom? 
Well, naturally, we assumed you were a serial killer. 
and as you can imagine, your bird is dead. 
yeah, but on the bright side, You've been downgraded From "suspect" to "person of interest." 
Some day, we're gonna look back on this and laugh. 
time does heal all wounds! 
now you wait just one minute. 
I am sorry to be using my barn voice In front of a lady, but i am riled up. 
it is not enough that you killed the bird I've had for almost 60 years. 
But the fact that you didn't trust me is unforgivable. 
But whd i expect? 
Look at you two walking around without a care in the world As budgets are slashed And people keep getting called into mr. Donaghy's office To be fired. 
I may just be a non-Special, But what you two did is inexcusable. 
Good day. 
I'm out of letters.I have to 
return my kids' braces. 
What did you do? 
We trusted you! 
You ruined it with your talking, didn't you? 
Hey! 
Why are you still messing with my show? 
What about last night? 
Liz, last night was what it was, But business is business. 
Right. And last night, 
i gave you the business. 
We had an agreement. 
Top front and some light ear work! 
You got your quid, halst where's my quo? 
Oh, my god. 
Last night was about the show? 
Oh, please, you know it was. 
You were all, oh, it's gotta be worth it And what you're asking me to do is such a big deal. 
It was a big deal. 
Being with a woman for the first time since my wife died. 
 Ah, snap. 
 It was just a transaction? 
What kind of person are you?! 
Does it help if i tell you I thought we were doing sexual espionage? 
Oh, god. 
Sharon! Angel! 
i swore to you the next one would be worthy, But she's not! 
she's a monster! 
Marissa, add dr. Walters 
to my sched. 
Let's go. Let's go. 
Let's go. 
Okay so mr. Halster has filed a complaint 
against you With human resources. 
Specifically, his claim suggests that you tried to barter sex In exchange for professional consideration. 
In the human resource world, We refer to that as "being a filthy prostitute." 
Now, since this is your first incident And, uh, mr. Donaghy has explained 
The mitigating circumstances... 
I'm convinced that this sexual outburst Was brought on by menopause. 
We are recommending only a two-Week suspension Without pay. 
Okay. That's fair. 
and obviously mr. halster cannot 
function In this hostile work environment. 
His company has reassigned him. 
And your budget review process will start over again Under my supervision. 
 Really. 
 Yes, really. 
I hope you've learned your lesson, miss lemon. 
When you harass sexually in the workplace, Things do not somehow just work out in the end. 
Mr. Donaghy, i thought you'd like to know 
That there's a spider on the printer. 
Oh, no. 
Am i interrupting? 
Is this another firing meeting? 
It is now. 
Kenneth, have a seat. 
Ken, we feel bad that we But mostly jenna--Gassed your bird. 
I agree. 
Not to name names, but it's so sad That a certain black individual Found it necessary to trick someone so pretty Into believing you were a murderer. 
I'm sorry, is there a point to all this? 
I've had a bad couple of days. 
Well, we feel terrible about what happened, So we did a little something to make it up to you. 
looks like i've got some naming to do. 
Pat. Balthazar. Donna. 
lorne. michael. 
Subtitle by: Kisauseven  How late is Tracy now? 
 2 1/2 hours. 
This is outrageous. 
Especially after I was told I can't leave during the day For my ridiculous anger management stupid piece of crap! 
How did this happen? 
I had Grizz call him at 8:00 this morning and pretend it was 11:00. 
I printed up that fake rehearsal schedule for him, Saying we were starting at 9:00 instead of noon. 
Oh, and I set all his watches and clocks  to say P.M. when it's really A.M. 
 Oh, boy. We may have overdone it. 
What the hell time is it? 
Hey, you're here! 
Let's rehearse! 
No! I took my son to his 
cello recital this morning at what turned out to be midnight yesterday! 
White oppressors, answer my question. 
What time is it, really? 
 2:45 P.M. 
 You're a bunch of racists. 
What? How did we jump 
to that already? 
You treat me like a child! 
No--worse than that! 
You treat me like one of those little pageant girls with the clip-on teeth. 
No, no, Oprah says that you teach people how to treat you, and this is what you've taught us, because you're always late And you take no responsibility for your actions. 
Irregardless! 
You know what? 
Race card. 
No, don't accept it! 
Hey, Jack, just a heads-up. 
Tracy knows what time it is. 
 Damn it. 
 Sir. 
Your mother would like to have breakfast with you At the hotel tomorrow, And she had me make dinner reservations for tonight. 
And by night, I mean 4:30 this afternoon. 
Colleen's in town? 
If you need a break, I'd be happy to take her out. 
There's a restaurant hostess in midtown I'd like to see cry. 
Thank you, but I need to be the attentive son this visit. 
This Thursday marks an anniversary for my mother, An unpleasant one. 
35 years ago, my father, Jimmy Donaghy, Went out for a pack of cigarettes, Came back, smoked one, Told my mother he was leaving forever, And walked out the door. 
Oh, boy, that must be hard... 
For both of you. 
He treated her like dirt all those years, Coming and going, taking up with other women, Including more than one Unitarian! 
Every time he came back, I promised myself I would tell him off. 
I had my speech all planned. 
But I always chickened out. 
It's the biggest regret of my life, Lemon... 
And I once made love to Kathy Hilton. 
Do you...Want a hug? 
What is this, the Italian parliament? 
No, thank you, Lemon. 
Well, you're a good son. 
I know she's not easy. 
Sir, your mother had me move her from the plaza To the Carlyle. 
Evidently, the concierge at the plaza "has a beard," and she'd rather not get raped. 
Please, tell me we've started. 
Yes, actually, we're on our second run-through. 
What is this? 
Tracy hasn't come back yet, But he did sent a gibbon to rehearse in his place. 
he's pretty good. 
Hey. 
Did you guys know about this? 
Tracy has asked us to read this prepared statement. 
 "Dear racist Liz Lemon..." 
 oh! 
"this is how you treat me, "like a white-whiskered gibbon "put on this earth to do nothing "but dance around for your amusement And reduce the insect population of Malaysia." 
Okay, I don't know Which of these five cell numbers he answers, But you get Tracy down here right now. 
Why? The gibbon is on time, 
he knows his blocking, And he doesn't try to bite the dancers! 
I think I've proven my point. 
Oh, my god! 
Like we really have time for you To walk down the stairs that slowly! 
Time jump! 
Tracy, it costs the show a lot of money When you pull these shenanigans. 
Don't patronize me with your Celtic slang, Liz Lemon. 
We have a black president now. 
What do you care? 
You voted for Nader! 
This is post-racial America, And I demand to be treated like everyone else. 
You wanna be treated like everybody else? 
Fantastic. 
Then tomorrow, I'm sending a regular town car for you Instead of one of those duck tour boats. 
Fine. 
And you're no longer allowed to point at women In the cafeteria and yell, "I wanna get that pregnant!" 
Fine, I'll bring my lunch from home. 
And be here tomorrow at 10:00 A.M. And know your lines. 
You don't think I could do that? 
We'll find out tomorrow at 10:00 A.M. 
Fine, but I'll have the last laugh. 
Ha ha ha ha ha! 
Ah ha ha ha ha! 
Hoo hah hah hah hah! 
Ah ha ha ha ha! 
Beth, that was a big mistake you made. 
Grizz, it was a year ago. 
You're engaged now. 
Just drop it, okay... 
Oh, hey, Dotcom. 
Yelling at Tracy in front of everybody Was a bad move, Liz. 
Yeah, well, it's not my job to protect his feelings. 
I told you she would turn cold. 
She's an ice queen. 
 Grizz. 
 I'm just sayin'. 
You humiliate Tracy in front of everybody like that, You give him two choices... 
one, he won't show up tomorrow, And you'll look like a fool in front of your crew. 
Or two, he will show up... 
and he'll find an even worse way to act out. 
Exactly. 
Jack! 
What are you doing here? 
I'm here to pick you up for dinner. 
No dinner. 
We're having breakfast in the morning. 
I told your girl. 
 My assistant is named Jonathan. 
 Yes, I know. I met him. 
And he also said we had a reservation for dinner tonight. 
Well, Jack, there's been a misunderstanding. 
I have a previous engagement with a friend. 
Hey Colleen, can I borrow one of your ties? 
Oh, brother. 
Paul, this is Jack, my son. 
Jack, this is Paul Brett. 
Mother, I didn't realize you were bringing a companion along. 
Companion? Ha! 
How fancy. 
Paul lives in Florida. 
He paints landscapes and he makes his own soda. 
Jack, why don't you join us for dinner? 
Great! 
I'll call the restaurant. 
See if they can seat a third wheel. 
Ah. Another day done. 
Now let's get outta here Before we realize we've forgotten about something. 
I feel like we're half-assing this. 
Oh, I didn't know anyone was here. 
That wasn't me screaming in the bathroom. 
What are you doing with him? 
Oh, Mr. Jordan says 
he doesn't need it anymore. 
So you're just letting him go? 
Well, don't worry. 
Once it tries to mate with a child, I'm sure animal control will just shoot it. 
No! He's not an animal. 
Look at him! 
He's a little person! 
Oh, he loves me! 
Somebody loves me. 
I'm gonna name him little Jenna And let him live in my dressing room. 
Lemon, Colleen brought her boyfriend. 
His name is Paul. 
 What? Really? 
 I don't like this guy. 
I don't trust him. 
I mean, he's four years younger than my mother. 
He wears a pinkie ring. 
When the waiter brought over the food, he said, "abbondanza." 
Okay, Jack, I know this is a stressful time For you and your mother... 
You're right--I don't like the timing of this at all. 
Colleen is very vulnerable right now, And scam artists can smell that sort of thing. 
Have you ever been to Florida? 
It's basically a criminal population. 
It's America's Australia. 
Come on, maybe he just likes her. 
You know, some men like older women. 
Let's...Not make this 
about you, okay? 
I've gotta call my private investigator. 
Liz, they want you onstage for rehearsal. 
 Tracy's here already? 
 I guess so. 
You know, this food area Is always the first place I go to look for you... 
Thank you, Cerie. 
Tracy, you're here already. 
Professional is my middle name. 
No need. 
I've got it memorized. 
I'm going to do a Valentino cross, Camera right, then dump the laugh. 
So stay on your fours, guys! 
One, two, three, jump and pose! 
3:15. 
Time for union break. 
Thank you, Tracy! 
That is so great for morale. 
Listen, about yesterday... 
No. Do not apologize. 
In fact... 
Everyone gather around. 
Actor announcement. 
I want to publicly thank you, Liz Lemon, For you have shown me that in today's world Everyone should be treated exactly the same. 
No one should get preferential treatment. 
I agree. 
Exactly. 
Not black comedy superstars. 
Not Hispanics. 
Not Indians. 
Not whatever this guy is. 
And not women, Liz Lemon. 
I'm right there with you, Tracy. 
Good. I feel parched 
from being so professional. 
Could I trouble you for some water? 
Yeah, of course. 
Brian, would you help me out with this? 
No! No! 
 Equality. 
 What? 
Everyone should be treated the same, right, Liz Lemon? 
You should change it. 
Yeah, okay. 
I know how to do this. 
No one help her! 
I got it. 
That's good. 
Just gotta get my hammies in the handles so I... 
Hold on. 
Oof! 
All right! 
Let's...Take it 
from the top. 
Hello, Len. 
Oh. Thanks for meeting me 
here, Mr. Donaghy. 
You, uh...Staking out 
a cheating husband? 
No. I'm taking 
a photography class. 
Look at the way the sunlight hits that cobweb. 
So, uh, what have you got for me? 
Well, I looked into this Paul Brett guy, And I gotta tell you, This is the weirdest case I've ever worked. 
I knew it. 
What is he, a check forger? 
Real estate swindler? 
Bird owner? 
 No, he's clean. 
 What? 
I've never seen anything like it. 
Everyone's got something to hide. 
For instance, I'm wearing a child's Halloween costume Under this. 
But this guy... 
no priors, no debts. 
He's been married to his wife Louise for 35 years. 
 He's married? 
 Yeah. 
I wish I had more to give you. 
But this Paul Brett guy, he's, uh... 
He's like a boy scout. 
I'm sorry, Mr. Donaghy. 
Miss Maroney, I have the ukulele you asked for. 
Oh, it's not for me. 
Someone's in a little mariachi band today. 
Ma'am, this is a wild animal. 
You can't treat it like a person. 
No, he's happy. 
His costume is hiding his erection. 
Well, as a child, I had a prize pig That I thought was my best friend. 
But then one day, I picked up one of her piglets. 
She went crazy! 
She bit off my nut sack That I kept tied around my belt to feed squirrels. 
Please be careful, Miss Maroney. 
Tracy did that thing with the water on purpose. 
Grizz and Dotcom warned me he would act out. 
Look, if Tracy's revenge plan Involves him being good at his job, You might have to just take it. 
Hello, Liz Lemon. 
I was just telling these fellas About how you don't wanna be treated any differently Because you're a woman. 
Well, thank you. 
Of course I don't. 
Really. You don't want us 
to hold back anymore. 
I'm sorry--were you guys holding back something? 
Our farts, to start with. 
Also, we didn't invite you to Lutz's fake bachelor party. 
Lutz's what? 
I realize I'm never getting married Because of my gland thing... 
But I wanna have a bachelor party. 
Well, you should have invited me. 
It's not fair... 
That you didn't. 
We're goin' to a strip club. 
I'm glad that we're having this conversation, Because we live in a world Where a lot of the old divisions Are starting to disappear. 
And I hope to have a daughter someday, And I want her to... 
Aghh. Oh, god, 
what is that smell? 
Oh, dear lord, frank! 
It's like orange-flavored egg! 
It's in my mouth! 
Good. We're learning. 
This next one's me. 
Ohh! 
Hey, Jack, do you treat me any differently Because I'm a woman? 
Well, I pay you a little less, yes. 
No, I mean day-to-day. 
 Do you coddle me? 
 In some ways. 
With a man, I can be more direct, But with you, uh, I have to have a conversation, Talk things through more. 
Gimme an example. 
Well, uh... 
Right now comes to mind. 
Are we through listening and sharing, Because I have something I want you to look at. 
It's a marriage certificate. 
It's Paul's marriage certificate. 
My mother's boyfriend. 
 He's married. 
 What? 
I knew I was right. 
That guy is shady! 
Oh, my god. 
Have you told Colleen? 
No Colleen. 
I have an opportunity here, Lemon, A chance to go back to the past to put things right That once went wrong. 
That's the quantum leap intro. 
Be that as it may, I'm finally going to stand up for Colleen. 
The small part of her that is still human deserves it. 
I'll see Paul, And I'll give him the speech I wrote for Jimmy Donaghy. 
 Paul's not your dad, Jack. 
 But Paul's here. 
And he's taking advantage of my mother. 
Now, what I originally wrote for my father May be dated. 
Who would be our current Nikita Khrushchev? 
Mm...Simon Cowell? 
Now you're standing on the very spot Where Gracie Allen took Jack Paar's virginity. 
I thought I heard a tour. 
Boy, people are not gonna believe That you saw this. 
 So take a lot of pictures. 
 Miss Maroney. 
No good will come of this. 
This is unnatural. 
It is unnatural...For 
a grandmother to look this good! 
Little Jenna had a baby last night. 
Crowd: Ooh! 
Thank you. 
Good job with the water, Liz. 
Ow, frank! 
What the hell? 
What? I'm trying 
to treat you like one of us. 
Hello, Elizabeth. 
Tracy, shouldn't you be working down on stage? 
I'm done with my work. 
I was very professional. 
Hmm. That must have been 
hard for you. 
It was. 
All right, Tracy's here. 
Let's do this bachelor party. 
 Yeah! 
 You coming, Liz Lemon? 
Because a dude boss would be a jerk If he didn't come to Lutz's bachelor party. 
Also a dude boss would pay for it. 
Yeah, I'm coming. 
Of course I'm coming. 
 But you're not. 
 Twist! 
You have to stay here. 
I haven't gotten your notes on the rewrite, And your input is invaluable to the process... 
Since we're all equal now. 
Let's go see some naked daughters and moms! 
 All right! 
 Whoo hoo! 
Oh. Hello, Jack. 
I'm sorry. 
Your mom's out shopping. 
I know. 
My credit card company called to confirm My purchase of a book entitled intercourse after hip surgery. 
Well...Why don't you 
come on in? 
I'm just watching the hotel channel. 
You can check out on the TV. 
I bet you can, you son of a bitch. 
I beg your pardon? 
I am tired of watching you treat my mother like this. 
I am not afraid of you. 
You're just a big bully. 
Like Simon Cowell. 
That's right. 
I just called you a communist. 
I want you out of our lives forever, and I want you to know That I am never going to be Anything like you when I grow up. 
What in god's name is going on here? 
Paul is leaving, mother. 
And I think you should know why. 
He's married. 
Oh, my... 
I know that! 
 Paul... 
Find something to do in the bathroom. 
I have to talk to my son. 
Okay. 
Shoot. 
You knew? 
It's Florida, Jack! 
It's like it never stopped being the '70s down there. 
And a guy like Paul, who can drive at night, You just don't say no to that! 
Well, I apologize then. 
I thought we were going to get through this together. 
I guess your coping mechanism Is to bring a married man back to your hotel room! 
Coping? 
What am I supposed to be coping with? 
It's the 35th anniversary of dad leaving! 
Which time, Jack? 
That man left and came back so many times That I totally lost count! 
One night, he went out to move the car, And he was gone... 
From the spring of '57 until... 
One night he just showed up out of the blue! 
"put your shoes on, Collie. 
We're goin' to see some like it hot." 
You honestly don't remember when he left for good, Because I sure as hell do. 
Oh, my god. 
Is that what this is all about? 
Is that what you've been holding onto all these years? 
Jack, stop wasting your time thinking about that man! 
You're nothing like him, you know. 
No way you ever could be. 
 What does that mean? 
 I don't know. 
I'm old, Jack, you know? 
And I don't know what I'm thinking about half the time. 
I do know this: You're my good boy. 
I just love ya to death. 
Thank you, mother. 
And I love you too. 
Paul! 
You're on your own tonight. 
I have a date with my son. 
He's taking me out to a late dinner. 
It's, uh, 6:00. 
Whoops! 
Say you like my body. 
I don't wanna be here! 
I don't like it here! 
Who's this guy? 
Okay, which one of us is gonna give up first? 
The black one. 
I can't take it anymore! 
I hate it! 
One of those strippers took of Lutz's shirt. 
That gland thing is no joke! 
Everything is upside down! 
We need to go back to the way things were With both of us getting preferential treatment. 
Yes. We upset 
the natural order. 
You're going to strip clubs. 
I'm up writing all night. 
Look who's a sailor! 
We're dressing monkeys up as people, And monkeys are playing with people as toys! 
It's not a toy, Tracy. 
Little Jenna thinks that this is her baby. 
 Oh, no! 
 You said you loved me! 
Your foot fingers are so strong! 
We don't wanna end up like those two. 
You're so right. 
We're okay! 
He's just expressing himself! 
Hey, before you hear crazy rumors and start believing them, The gibbon did not attack Jenna. 
He was trying to mate with her face. 
 What? 
 Nothing. Everyone's fine. 
Hey! Some like it hot. 
I love this movie. 
My mother told me she and my dad Went to see it together, And if that's the stuff she remembers, Maybe that's how I should remember him too... 
On a date with my mom instead of walking out the door. 
1959. Boy, it would have 
been fun to write back then. 
You could get away with crazy plot twists Because audiences were so much less sophisticated. 
Wait a minute. 
This movie came out in 1959? 
How could my father have been gone From the spring of '57 until 1959 If I was conceived in '58... 
Jimmy Donaghy's not my father. 
Twist! 
I'm gonna duck uptown and have lunch with my boyfriend. 
Yes, ma'am. 
Is that code for some kind of older gal medical procedure? 
No, I really have a boyfriend. 
 Look, he's handsome and a doctor. 
 A doctor? 
Well, don't get too attached. 
As soon as people realize his tonics don't work, it's on to the next town. 
You know what I have a craving for? 
Jerk chicken from that place in Mill Basin? 
And some? 
Catalog photos of expectant mothers in their swimming suits? 
You are my radar O'Reilly. 
Now get in here and rub my feet till you hear a chopper coming. 
How's Tracy? 
 What's his mood? 
 Upbeat and confused. 
 Perfect. You know his contract is up. 
 Has it been that long? 
We sure have done some crazy things with Tracy in the last three years. 
We sure have. 
I'm thinking about some of them now. 
Me too. 
Anyway, I'm handling the Tracy thing myself. 
Right. Play hardball. 
Get your business jollies. 
Sadly enough this time, with Tracy, it's not about money anymore. 
His video game made a fortune and he invested all of it in a company that dismantles bank signs. 
They're doing very well. 
 You don't think he's gonna leave? 
 Don't worry. 
When you're above money, personal relationships become your currency. 
Tracy and I have become quite close. 
Look. We got BFF bracelets. 
You guys are best friends forever? 
That's not what that stands for. 
Why would you celebrate that? 
Tell me where you went to school again? 
Well... I... 
 You really look nice today. 
 Thank you. 
 Do you know her? 
 No, I don't think so. 
Wait! No! 
That's my car! 
Meter's expired. 
I forgot to get quarters. 
You know what? 
I got quarters. 
 Thanks, officer. 
 You're welcome. 
People sure are nice to you. 
I guess. 
Excuse me. 
I'm Calvin Klein and I think you should be my next underwear model. 
Well, thanks. 
You don't wanna get a card, phone number? 
Subtitles:  Feygnasse Team  Proofreading: So., Valpi. 
Episode 315: "The Bubble" You went to Plunder for lunch? 
How did you get a table? 
I don't know. It was packed. 
But they just gave Drew a table. 
It's ridiculous how people treat him. 
The chef sent over food. 
Ladies sent drinks. 
Mayer Bloomberg asked him to dance. 
Beautiful people are treated differently from... 
moderately... 
pleasant-looking people. 
 It's true. 
 They live in a bubble. 
A bubble of free drinks, kindness, and outdoor sex. 
How did Drew turn out as well as he did going through life like that? 
The bubble isn't always a bad thing. 
Look at me. I turned out OK, didn't I? 
I want you to pay close attention to the following over-the-top eye roll. 
Oh brother! 
I don't share this often. 
But this is a photo of me when I was 25 years old. 
What the... what? 
You have a superman chest! 
 I know. 
 Oh, my god. 
The lady will have two tickets to the gun show. 
And your eyes are so much bluer. 
 What happened to your eyes? 
 My point is, the bubble doesn't last forever. So get 
in there with Drew and enjoy those perks  while you can. 
 Can I keep that? 
It's my only copy. 
Everyone gather around please. 
Actor announcement. 
As you probably know, especially if you read page six of my publicist's emails, I have decided to cut my hair and donate it to charity. 
But, why would you cut your beautiful hair? 
You look just how I picture Mary Magdalene. 
Because, I'm a selfless person who can't get arrested in this town. 
Meanwhile, Tracy's face is everywhere. 
I already explained that. 
That was a police sketch of a flasher who happened to look like Tracy... We hope. 
 Whatever. He's hogging the buzz. 
 You've got buzz. 
You were in that magazine that time. 
I don't even know what you're referring to. 
And that was two years ago. 
As usual, I have to create my own opportunities. 
No one will be talking about Tracy Jordan this Friday when I cut my hair off on The Today Show. 
You're what I think Judas looks like. 
I hope you know how much we value you here at TGS. I like to think 
of this staff as a family. 
This is better than a family. 
No one around here asks me for my damn bone marrow. 
Why don't we make this easy on ourselves and renew your existing contract with a 3% increase? 
Sorry it took me so long to answer. 
I was just thinking about how weird it is that we eat birds. 
All right, we have a deal. 
You see how easy negotiating can be when it's not really about money. 
How's this really not about money? 
Obviously you don't need to work. 
What's that now, Charles? 
I'm just saying you made $300 million last year, so there's no financial need for you to continue with the show, but... 
I never thought of it like that. 
Thank you. 
I quit. Goodbye. 
Had he really not put that together? 
Tracy's is a tactile kinesthetic learning style. 
So help me god... 
It's nice of those guys to give up their court for us. 
Yes, for us. 
So I should probably warn you I was pro in college. 
What? 
I started teaching kids at the Y and then all their mothers wanted to take private lessons from me. 
But I promise I'll take it easy on you. 
It's been a long time since college? 
What do you mean? 
Excuse me. 
Do you give lessons? 
 Now what is this? 
 Dr. Drew's salmon bourguignon. 
What is this orangey taste? 
Gatorade. 
That was awesome. 
Are you choking? 
I'm a doctor. Stay calm. 
I just need to shake it loose. 
Don't panic. I just need something 
to push it down with. 
Do you have a chopstick or a fireplace match or something? 
There you go. 
Jack, there you are. 
 I need to talk to you about something. 
 The Tracy deal is a process. 
We are in process. 
Something happened with Drew. 
 He's not a BFF? 
 No! Never. 
It's the bubble. 
He is a doctor who doesn't know the Heimlich maneuver. 
He can't play tennis. 
He can't cook. 
He's as bad at sex as I am. 
But he has no idea. 
That is the danger of being super handsome. 
When you're in the bubble, nobody tells you the truth. 
For years I thought I spoke excellent French. 
Drew deserves to be told the truth. 
He's a good person who is a victim of our nation's obscene cult of superficiality. 
Did you tell him that he was no good in tennis? 
No, I let him win cause I wanted to make out with him in the cab. 
It's not fair to let Drew live a lie. 
 And I think I'm the woman to fix him. 
 Be careful. 
You wake a sleepwalker, you risk getting urinated on. 
Or thanked... on. 
 Mr. Jordan quit. 
 What? 
I thought you were in process. 
Tracy's taking a strong position right now in the negotiation. 
It's not unheard of for him to stay home while I formulate my counter-proposal. 
What if it doesn't work? 
What if he doesn't come back? 
When I get upset my accent come out! 
And when it gets to comin' out I can't get to talkin'... 
I have a show on Friday. 
It will be rectified. 
I didn't mean to upset you. 
Mr. Donaghy told us not to tell you 
but I couldn't hold it in anymore. 
Wait a minute. Are you hiding 
your screw-up from me? 
Don't cling to this. 
Be a manager. 
Control your people. 
Buy better clothes. 
I'm allowing this because I made a misstep. I'm handling it. 
And Tracy will be here by Friday night. 
Just get it done. 
Nope, I lost it. 
That was Batman. 
Thank you team Jenna for being here. 
Obviously my Today Show charity haircut is just the first step in my reinvention. 
 This is serial killer language. 
 My mother's boyfriend raised me to believe that a woman's hair is her crowning glory. 
A haircut can make or break a career. 
Before the Rachel, Jennifer Aniston was just a chunky nobody  who couldn't get a job. 
 Wasn't she already on Friends? 
Richard Esposito, move to the back. 
If I make the wrong choice, I could end up like Keri Russell, Felicity, season 2. 
Let's brainstorm. Everyone shout out 
words that describe my beauty. 
 Fading. 
 '80s. 
1880s. 
 You needed me? 
 You know Rick from accounting? 
 I don't. Hi. 
 Hi, nice to meet you. 
I have arrange for one of Tracy's childhood idols to reach out to him. 
 Hello? 
 Tracy, this is Jack. 
I have someone here who wants to speak with you. 
This is Bill Cosby. 
 Really? This is your strategy? 
 I heard him do this at a party. 
I want you to come back to the TGS for the people who like the jokes and the things. 
Bill Cosby, you got a lot of nerve getting on the phone with me after what you did to my aunt Paulette! 
I think you're confusing me with someone else. 
1971, Cincinnati. 
She was the cocktail waitress with the droopy eye. 
I'm the guy with the pudding... 
Try to tell me what to do? 
Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable 
with your light-ass kids. 
Why would you make me talk to this man? 
Don't hang up. 
Tracy, this is Billy Dee Williams. 
I just wanna say I love your work. 
It's very smooth. 
Sorry I'm late. 
Why are you waiting here? 
I put our name in but it's gonna be a 45 minute wait. 
What? 
I'll go talk to the hostess. 
I wanna show you something. 
We're going to wait for the table. 
I hate this. 
This is gonna be unpleasant. 
As Tracy's family and inner circle, I wanted to enlist your help. 
While I'm sure all of you treasure him being home more... 
I'm sorry. You want our help 
with your problem? 
You need to get our father back to work. 
That's what I'm trying to do. 
You wanna see what he packed me for lunch today? 
Mayonnaise... 
 And a pack of cigarettes. 
 That is unfortunate. 
He set up a home recording studio in our rec room. 
My girl has a fat neck I'm sharp. 
Let's do it again. 
Thanks to you, I now have an unemployed father. 
You trying to make a stereotype out of me? Did you even vote for Obama? 
We've heard from Tracy junior. 
Where is your mother? 
Gone to take a spa week at Canyon Ranch before my dad broke it in half. 
What's that supposed to mean? I should 
not have to hear that. I'm a child! 
Tracy junior, George Foreman, I want to get your father back to work just as much as you do. 
But what do I offer the man who has everything? 
I don't know what to do. 
I didn't come here to hear more excuses. 
I'm here to see the dumbest cracker in all of New York. 
You gotta fix this, Donaghy. 
Fix this! 
You know I don't see it on the menu but I would love a catfish po'boy and a diet raspberry Fanta. 
That is a great idea. 
Let me order that for you. 
Excuse me. 
We will have a turkeyburger deluxe and a catfish po'boy with a diet raspberry Fanta. 
I'm gonna come back in five minutes you try to order off the menu again I will smack those glasses off your face. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
What was that? 
Why didn't she call you "sweetheart"? 
And where's the complimentary app sampler? What's going on? 
This is how most people live. 
See, because of your whole, you know,  Disney prince thing... 
 Actually they used footage of me from high school swim team to draw prince Eric. 
Right, because of that... 
you live in a bubble where people do what you want and tell you what you wanna hear. 
 I don't think that's true. 
 I'm gonna tell you for your own good. 
You can't put Gatorade on salmon. 
Yes, you can. The hot Italian lady 
from the food network told me so. 
Did she say it on TV? 
She said it to me when she jumped escalators to try to talk to... 
I don't wanna live that way. 
I don't want you to treat me that way. 
Are you sure? 
I'm an adult. 
You can be honest with me. 
I can take it. 
 That's game. Your serve. 
 That's it! I quit! 
This racquet is a fart and you cheat! 
You're a cheating bitch! 
I need your help. 
You know Tracy quite well, wouldn't you say? 
I know Mr. Jordan like the back 
of my stepfather Ron's hand. 
I know all his ATM pin codes. 
I know when he's cranky and needs his binky. 
I know that by binky he means 1970s pornography. 
So how is he functioning without you? 
I'm still doing everything for him. 
Tonight I have to ride my bike over to his house in New Jersey to hold his hand during Lost. 
That's it, don't you see? 
 You're our ace in the hole. 
 How dare you! 
You're what I've been looking for. 
The one thing at TGS that Tracy cannot live without. 
Now, I need you... 
to cut Tracy off completely. 
I don't know if I could do that. 
You want him to come back, don't you? 
This is the only way. 
Don't answer that. 
It could be Tracy. 
But I have to answer the phones. 
That's my job. 
Hello. Studio 6H. 
This is... 
Cranston. 
Hey Cranston, I was looking for Kenneth. 
He's not here. 
But I'm sure wherever he is, he loves you very much. 
You seem really stressed out. 
You wanna talk about what's going on? 
I just hope it's not a mistake. 
Maybe it is. 
But you have to listen to your heart. 
But why meddle with something that was great? 
It'll grow back. 
What? 
We're talking about my hair, right? 
Fat neck girl Let me count your neck rings I'm thirsty! 
Family! 
Who's in charge of my thirst? 
Why hasn't Kenneth called me back yet? 
I miss him. 
Why are you crying? 
This is too hard, Mr. Donaghy. 
I cannot stand by while Mr. Jordan 
dies of dehydration in his recording studio. 
Plus, I've started to dream as Cranston. 
The more desperate Tracy becomes the more our plan is working. 
Next thing he'll do is show up here. 
He'll demand you go with. You say no. 
Stay strong and he'll cave. 
Trust me. 
I hope your right. 
Because you're playing with people's lives here. 
Don't you think I know that? 
We are back with sketch comedian Jenna Maroney. 
Thank you, Meredith. 
But please, I'm not a hero. 
Just trying to raise awareness that I'm more than that hot chick on Tracy Jordan's show. 
 So this is for Locks of Love? 
 Locks of Love turned me down. 
They said my hair was too processed for a sick person to wear. 
But this is for a wonderful charity called Merkins of Hope. 
Let's make the big cut. 
So what about that crazy news that Tracy Jordan  has quit TGS? 
 What? 
Word is he quit over a contract dispute. 
Guess you're the only star left on that show. 
Stop cutting my hair! 
I don't need this anymore! 
It's OK. 
It's OK. 
I can fix this. 
Is Tracy still not here? 
We have 3 hours before the show. 
Security told me that he's in the building, so it's working. 
Now it's all up to Kenneth Ellen Parcell. 
I've been calling you. Has Cranston 
not been giving you my messages? 
He told me. 
Well... don't worry. 
Just came to get a few of my things. 
Then I won't bother you. 
All right, I guess that's everything. 
But I want you to know if I walk out that door, I'm not gonna call again. 
It's over. 
You understand? 
I can't do this. 
I'm sorry, but I can't. 
Mr. Donaghy wanted me to stop 
talking to you so you'd come back. 
So you used Cranston as his gatekeeper. 
I'm very disappointed. 
I know, I blew it. 
I guess I'm only farm strong and not heart strong. 
Fine. Go and help him. 
I shouldn't have tried to... 
manipulate the two of you that way. 
But I will need you to turn in your page jacket. 
What? 
Your main duty was taking care of Tracy. 
He no longer works here. 
Therefore your services are no longer required. 
As a page? 
Wait a minute. 
You want to fire my boy Ken? 
Stay out of this. 
It's not your concern. 
 Unless. 
 Unless what? 
You said Kenneth can't work here because I don't work here. 
But if I work here, so can Kenneth. 
 I don't understand. 
 Of course you don't, you idiot. 
I'm coming back to work! 
With Kenneth! 
Damn you and your meddling. 
I'll be in my dressing room. 
Atta boy. Come on. 
I've gotta get back into that bubble. 
Sir, you are pulling that look off. 
I wanted to apologize for my behavior the other day on the tennis court. 
That is not who I am. 
 But you made me feel like a loser  Cause you lost. 
Maybe I shouldn't have done that to you, but... 
you have so much potential. 
But I'm happy this way. 
I didn't like it outside the bubble. 
 It was very ironic. 
 No, it wasn't. 
 That's not how you use that word... 
 Stop it. 
I wanna use ironic however I want. 
I wanna stay in the bubble. 
And I want you in there with me. 
Come on. 
Come away with me. 
We can go upstate on my new motorcycle. 
I don't think this is going to work. 
I guess I'll see you around then. 
Or as the french say, I'll see you around. 
Uh, is this important? 
It'll just take a second. 
Fine, but Mr. Donaghy is on another call right now and 
doesn't have time for a separate interaction with you. 
So everything he says will have to work for both conversations. 
 Really? 
 Lemon. 
Lemon works for your business call? 
Oh, right, well, I just wanted to let you know that I have to go to Chicago for jury duty because I never changed my residence to New York. 
Why not? 
Because I wanted to vote in a swing state, Jack. 
Also, I want to stay on the mailing list at Chicago Pizza Explosion. 
How fast can you turn it around? 
Who, me? Oh, right. I'll 
fly back in the morning. 
I never get put in a jury. 
I wear my Princess Leia costume, and they dismiss me immediately. 
Well, that sounds good for both of us. Thank you very much, sir. 
That last part didn't work both ways. You said sir. 
I think it worked fine. I'll have Jonathan 
call travel and upgrade your flight. 
Sweet. 
What do you take to fly? 
Candy and magazines. 
No, no, no. Pills. 
Nobody flies without medication anymore. 
Why shouldn't you enjoy the same luxuries as a dog? 
Comana it may cause dizziness, sexual nightmares, and sleep crime. 
It's... Very good. 
Tyler Brody on two, sir. 
Tyler Brody? The dude from the olympics? 
Yes, he was the silver medalist in tetherball. 
Speedman's caught an angle. 
Tyler Brody is flailing. 
And there's the coil. 
Lance Speedman is the olympic tetherball champion. 
And Tyler Brody can't believe it. 
Boy, there sure are a lot of weird olympic events these days. 
Not that weird, lemon. 
Tetherball we faked. 
What? Why would you 
fake an olympic event? 
For ratings. 
We staged several events so that americans could win more medals. 
That's despicable. 
It took years of planning, and now Tyler Brody is threatening to go public and ruin everything. 
So, obviously, I have a lot on my plate and no time to babysit the sixth flo, so before you go gallivanting off to Chicago, make sure you get your people under control. 
 Be a manager. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
Liz, Tracy is countersuing me. 
 Good morning. 
 For defamation of character. 
Who's been arrested in three different Chuck E. Cheese's? 
Do y'all know who I am? 
Seriously. Please, tell me who I am. 
Jenna, I'm not taking sides in this lawsuit thing. 
It's ridiculous. 
Tracy's video game never would have worked without my voice acting. 
I deserve to get paid. 
Liz Lemon! Nemesis. 
Liz, will you tell Tracy I don't even want to speak with him. 
Okay, two can play at that game. 
Liz, could you please tell Kenneth that Liz wants him? 
That's not even okay, that's it. 
I am calling human resources and setting up a mediation for you. 
I told you. I don't 
drink that much at work. 
Mediation is a binding form of non-judicial dispute resolution. 
I watched Boston Legal nine times before I realized it wasn't a new Star Trek. 
Liz, you have to admit this is unfair. 
I got nothing. 
Meanwhile, Grizz and Dotcom bought a boat. 
Cape Hatteras is lovely this time of year. 
Oh, well, of course, Tracy takes care of his boys and not you. 
He thinks he can take advantage of you because you're a woman. 
Men think they can get away with anything. 
It's like when Adrien Brody kissed Halle Berry at the Oscars. 
No one has it harder in this country today than women. 
It turns out we can't be president, we can't be network news anchors, Madonna's arms look crazy. 
Tyler, I know you're upset we didn't pick you for the gold, and I'm going to make it up to you. 
How would you like to host Deal or No Deal  in the privacy of your own home? 
I think I'll hold a press conference instead, tell the world there's no such thing as olympic tetherball... 
or octuples tennis. 
It's all a lie. 
A white lie that did a lot of good for this country's morale. 
Did you know that President Bush's approval rating was almost as high as 15% following the olympics? 
Gasp. Olympic hero Tyler Brody. 
Olympic fraud. 
There is no such thing as olympic tetherball. 
They made it all up for the ratings. 
What are you saying? 
Tyler... 
You can be the voice of Knight Rider. 
The film. 
I'm listening.

������Ʒ ����Ļ����ѧϰ���� �Ͻ�������ҵ;�� =YTET����԰��Ļ��= ʱ����: ������ ����: uu�� ���� У��: ��ճ�� 30 Rock Season03 Episode02 Okay, I'm Jeffrey. I am a mediator. 
And you two are having a dispute. 
Now why is that? 
Because Tracy thinks he can treat me unfairly because I'm a woman. 
What? Please. 
We are here because white folks think they can do whatever they want to do to black folks. 
It's like when Adrien Brody kissed Halle Berry at the oscars. 
White people stole jazz, rock and roll, Will Smith, and heart disease. 
Now they think they can take my hard-earned money. 
Ay, well, if we look at how voice actors are normally compensated Liz says in this day's America, it's harder to be a woman than a black man. 
Liz Lemon? That chick is dumb. 
Okay. 
Tracy, do you know women still get paid less than men for doing the same job? 
Do you know it's still illegal to be black in Arizona? 
Do you have any idea how hard it is to be an overweight, transgender in this country? 
In preparation for landing at Chicago's O'Hare airport... 
No, grandma, no. 
"Believe in the stars." 
It's like that doesn't even mean anything anymore. 
Kenneth. 
I'm sure I can trust your discretion about what happened in my office today. 
What you overheard was some rather grown-up talk. 
Was any of it real, Mr. Donaghy? 
Beer pong, jazzercise, women's soccer. 
You're not in stone mountain anymore, Kenneth. 
This is the real world, and not everything is in black and white. 
There's always a right thing to do, Mr. Donaghy. 
Just sometimes, it's not the easy thing to do. 
Tyler Brody was not the only hero I lost today, sir. 
The other hero was you, in case that I got it, Kenneth. 
If it weren't for you people, I'd still be in Africa. 
Gorgeous, politically stable Africa. 
My people? 
Women are the oppressed ones. 
And it's even harder being a beautiful woman. 
Everyone assumes I don't try in bed. 
 It's discrimination. 
 Whatever. 
You couldn't last one day in my shoes, maroney. Right, Toof? 
No, thank you. 
I could totally be black. 
You should try being a white woman. 
Okay, I will. 
No, no, no, no. 
I don't like where this is heading. 
Freaky friday social experiment. 
Oh, it's on. 
Where is Liz Lemon? 
I don't really think it's fair for me to be on a jury because I can read thoughts. 
Dismissed. 
Welcome aboard flight 1876 to New York. 
 Hello? 
 Lemon, as part of our deal to keep him quiet, Tyler Brody is going to be on your show this week. 
But he won't do any tetherball stuff. 
Boy, Jack, it must be nice to dump your problems on other people. 
It is. Lemo do you think 
Kenneth admires you? 
Sure, that kid looks up to everybody. 
He calls Tracy's lizards "sir." 
So someone would have to be a complete monster to lose his respect. 
Yeah. 
I don't know what we're talking about. 
We're talking about nobody. 
A hillbilly nobody that doesn't know anything. 
 Hello? 
 Tracy is a white woman, Liz. 
What? 
He's trying to prove that being a white woman is easier than being a black man. 
Wait, no, what about the mediation? 
We are way past that. 
This is gonna be bigger than when tyra banks put on that fat suit. 
And n't worry, when I prove Tracy wrong, you'll get all the credit. 
What are you gonna do? Jenna? 
Hello? 
Liz, it's Becky, your college roommate. 
I'm sorry. Who? 
Hey, Liz Lemon, you're already treating me with more respect. 
Oh, god, Tracy. 
You wait till I test this noise out on society. 
Minds will be blown. 
No. No society. Do not go outside. 
Do not let Jack Donaghy see you. 
Tracis, listen to me-- oh, boy. 
This pill's damn strong. 
You can't fix this, Liz Lemon. 
It's about race. It's about 
being a woman. It's about money. 
It's about being on TV. And 
no one understands all that. 
Hello. 
I'm gonna call you back. 
I snitting next to Borpo. 
Whoa, Portland's got a fun little waterfront. 
Do you mind if I close this window shade? 
I'm trying to adopt a baby, but my job is making it impossible because my work self is suffocating my life me. 
I'm Liz Lemon, and I lost my virginity at 25. 
I saw the show about following your fear, and it inspired me to wear shorts to work. 
It didn't go great. 
Do you know Tracy Jordan? 
I took a pill earlier, but I didn't get my september issue of O Magazine. 
Do you have the number for subscriptions? 
Why would you? Blagh! 
I eat emotionally. 
And one time at summer camp, I kissed a girl on a dare, but then she drowned. 
And here comes some more stuff. 
I hate my feet. 
And once, I had a sex dream about Nate Berkus, but halfway through, he turned into Dr. Oz. 
Has that ever happened to you?  
A hug. This is happening. 
It's all right, Liz. It's all right. 
Uh, I'm okay. Please stay close. 
Uh, can you keep your hands outside my clothes? 
 Okay. 
 Good. 
Kenneth, I'm a good person. 
If you say so, sir. 
But sometimes life is complicated. 
There isn't always a right answer. 
Say you're in a life boat. 
You're on a life boat. 
The boat holds eight people, but you have nine on board. 
Either you will capsize and everyone will drown, or one person can be sacrificed to save the othe. 
Now how do you decide who should die? 
Oh, I don't believe in hypothetical situations, Mr. Donaghy. 
That's like lying to your brain. 
Kenneth, you've lived a sheltered life. 
Virtue never tested is no virtue at all. 
Oh, I have been tested, sir. 
There are only two things I love in this world: everybody and television. 
But up in my neighborhood, we can't even afford cable. 
So my neighbor the colonel and I just watch whatever the old rabbit ears pick up. 
A lot of folks have chosen to go ahead and steal cable from the poor, defenseless cable company. 
But not me. 
As bad as I want all those channels, I don't do it because stealing is wrong. 
Kenneth, I'm familiar with the ten commandments. 
Ten? 
A lot of us women eat otionally, Liz, and while we're not always in control of our feelings, we do control the decisions we make. 
I know. Of course. 
Now you say that you want a child. 
And yet, you let Jenna and Tracy fill that role in your life. 
Maybe you're afraid of taking that next step. 
Oh, my god. That's it. 
Now that we've leveled off, I think they're gonna serve us a little snack. 
So true. So wise. 
You know, when you say that to everything, it makes me feel like you're not listening. 
Sorry. 
Here. Try this. It's wonderful. 
Salt water taffy from Rhode Island. 
Wow, is this one of your favorite things? 
Oh, yes, and I have so many wonderful favorite things this year Sweater capes, calypso music, paisley tops, chinese checkers, High-heeled flip-flo that lift up your butt and give you a workout, and you, Liz Lemon. 
Too many women are wearing themselves too thin these days. 
And what suffers because of that? 
 Your bowel movements. 
 Your personal life. 
Personal life, yes. 
I want to help you. What can I do? 
Oh, my god, would you say, "please welcome Liz Lemon"? 
No, but here is what I will do. 
While I'm in New York, if you want, I can stop by, and I can talk to Tracy and Jenna. 
Solve that little problem for ya. 
So you can concentrate on Liz for once. 
Oh, you are the best person in the whole world. 
Good grief. 
Hi, strangers. Do you think I'm sexy? 
Giggle, giggle, giggle. 
Tracy, I know it's you, and, yeah, I do. 
I'm meeting my girlfriends for brunch. 
I hope we can sit outside. 
Lipstick! 
Jack, what are you doing down here? 
It's been a real crazy day, lemon. 
We're bidding to build a wind farm in Turkey, I'm trying to convince the board to sell the locomotive division, And Kenneth is being a real stick-in-the-mud. 
Well, there's nothing to see down here. 
Everything is under control in studio 6-H. 
Good morning. 
No! No. No. No, no, no. No, no, no. 
No, no, no, no. Wait, stop. 
Why do you have a monster claw? 
They ran out of white makeup because I insisted they do my buttocks. 
Good morning. 
What is going on here? 
Jenna and I are doing a social experiment. 
No, you're not. Wait. 
What is Jenna doing? 
You gotta ease on down ease on down the road right this minute. 
Stop that right now. 
This is worse than when you wore your shorts to work. 
You realize this is incredibly offensive. 
Yes. 
And you realize blackface makeup reignites racial stereotypes African-Americans have worked for hundreds of years to overcome? 
Here we go. 
Yeah, it's bad. I get it. 
Go get some baby wipes. 
We're trying to prove who has it hardest in America, women or black men. 
I'll tell you who has it the hardest. White men. 
We make the unpopular, difficult decisions, the tough choices. 
We land on the moon and Normandy Beach,  and yet they resent us. 
Well, sir, I'm sorry to disagree, but I am also a white man. 
Uh, no, you are not. 
Socioeconomically speaking you are more like an inner-city latina. 
The point is, men like me have to step in and clean up messes like this. 
No, you don't. 
I've got this under control. 
She's coming, Jack. 
Oprah is coming. 
And she's gonna fix everything. 
Oprah. 
Oh, my, what was that? 
We've tripped the emergency brake, Kenneth. 
Mr. Donaghy. 
And I've hermetically sealed this elevator car. 
No air can get in or out. 
Don't worry, folks. 
Help will be here soon. 
And we have enough oxygen for eight people. 
Unfortunately, there are nine of us in here now. 
One must die. 
Mr. Donaghy! 
In the panel where the elevator phone should be, I've placed a pistol loaded with one bullet. 
It's empty. 
Then you'll have to choke me with my belt. 
I will fight you. It's human nature. 
What's wrong with you? 
Oprah smells like rosewater and warm laundry. 
Did she tell you any of her new favorite things for this year? 
Calypso, paisley, Chinese checkers, and sweater capes. 
Let's go to the mall. 
Did she touch you? 
Well, Kenneth, I give up. 
I thought pure morality died with Chuck Heston, but you proved me wrong. 
You are better than all of us. 
You are one latina fantastica. 
Hola. 
Kenneth Ellen Parcell, you are my hero. 
You don't mean hero like sandwich, do you? 
No, Kenneth. Not like sandwich. 
You deserve this! 
Oh, no. 
Oprah's coming. 
I haven't seen Oprah since she did that episode about the worst celebrity dads. 
Um, Liz, your guest is here. 
Oprah! 
Hello, Liz Lemon! 
Uh, how you doing? 
What were you on? That's a kid. 
That does explain some of the stuff she said. 
I get to fly first class because my mom's a flight attendant. 
I lost my headgear at six flags. 
My boyfriend's in ninth grade. 
It's not Oprah. 
I thought it was Oprah. 
It's a spunky little tween. 
Now, as I'm sure Liz has told you, I am pam. 
Pam. 
I'm a middle school class vice president, a certified and trained baby sitter, And I recently got internet in my room. 
I think I gave her wine. 
I believe I can achieve anything. 
So let's get down to solving this problem: Which one of you is janna? 
Hello, Mr. Donaghy. 
Did you have a good night, Kenneth? 
Oh, yes, sir. 
Hardly any screaming from the colonel. 
Actually, I was thinking, we all try to be perfect, but the world maybe, well Uh, what I'm trying to say... 
There's a whole channel on the cable that just tells you what's on the other channels. 
I know, Kenneth. It's okay. 
I'm glad I'm not a white man, Mr. Donaghy. 
Is Spongebob Squarepants supposed to be terrifying? 
You're darn right he is, Kenneth. 
I knew it. 
Yesterday, Liz and I realized that she's probably wearing the wrong bra size. 
Yup. That one's definitely bigger. 
And that made me feel sad. 
Now show me your emotion drawings. 
Tracy, your emotion is upside-down. 
That's the way my world is right now. 
I guess I'm gonna have to clean up your mess after all. 
She's twelve. 
How did I It's okay. It happens to the best of us. 
In-flight medication is how I met M. Night 
Shyamalan, until it turned out to be That was the best day of my life. 
Liz, we worked it out. 
I've been hearing, but I haven't been listening. 
And I need to stop being a frenemy and be your real b.f.. 
Well, it looks like my work here is done. 
So I'll see you at my parents' house for dinner. 
My best friend Gail can't make it because she has some algebra test tomorrow. 
Oh, Gail. 
Good job, Lemon. 
Good job, Pam, really. 
Be a white man. Take credit. 
# Lean on me when you're not strong... 
We're not doing that now. 
Stop that. Do you hear me? 
I don't think I should be drinking this. 
Oh, come on. Like you never have a drink? 
Well, I did have some champagne at my cousin's wedding once. 
Yeah, you did. To Oprah. 
My name is Pam. 
Oh, Oprah! 
We're at a party,lemon, try to loosen up a little. 
How could i loosen up? 
I'm in connecticut, i haven't eaten, and i'm stressed about an "away toilet" situation. 
Do you know how luy we are? 
We are in gavin volure's home. 
He was the c.e.o.of sunstream. 
Yeah,i don't know what that is. 
Is this potpourri or chips? 
'Cause i'm gonna try to eat it. 
Volure is a god. 
He was the first man to be on the cover offortuneandjet magazine at the same time. 
Of course,that was back whenjetwas actually about jet ownership. 
That magazine took a weird turn. 
These are not chips. 
Then he fell off the face of the earth, sold sunstream, and shut himself off from the world. 
They say he hasn't left his home in almost three years. 
Well,i hope he shows up for dinner. 
He's already here. 
Thank you all for coming tonight. 
Because of my severe agoraphobia and my debilitating wealth... 
I am forced to bring the world to me, and host dinners for interesting people from all walks of life. 
The world of fashion, society, art collecting and yelling... 
Why isn't there any good art in here? 
Come on! 
Business and historical fiction. 
Really? 
What if the germans had won the war,lemon? 
And the arts. 
I'm glad jack was able to bring you,liz. 
I asked him about you after i saw your photo in the style section of thenew york times. 
Funny story,i was only wearing that because the fire alarm went off while i was getting a haircut. 
Well,you looked beautiful. 
and,as always, i keep one chair empty, to represent our unfulfilled hopes and dreams. 
I'm just kidding, eliot spitzer's hooker couldn't make it. 
Now,i want to send my driver into manhattan to pick up dessert. 
Anybody know a good place for cupcakes? 
I think there's a place mcenroe,give me a break.I'm on it. 
77th and amsterdam, 68th and columbus, 125th and president clinton boulevard, Also,don't over think it, sara lee,frozen, unbelievable.

30 Rock Season03 Episode04 Mr. Jordan,what are 
you still doing here? 
I don't want to go home, ken. 
You know my two sons, tracy,jr. And george foreman? 
They've been acting really weird lately. 
Where you going? 
Nowhere. 
Those two have never paid me any attention. 
And rightly so. 
I'm a strange man who can't be taken seriously. 
Now they won't let me out of their sight. 
Oh,maybe they love you. 
Nope. Look what the little one made me. 
Aw,that's cute. 
This is voodoo,ken! 
Those two are up to something. 
Sometimes,kids act out when there's a big change. 
I know i was a handful when my family moved from our farm house to that militia camp in the woods. 
Well,there is all this new money coming in. 
And it's not just from the video game. 
It's the tie-ins, the toys, the life-sized tracy jordan sex doll. 
They're selling like hotcakes in japan. 
Well,you know what they say, money is the root of all evil. 
I thought that was just a tagline for my movie,death bank. 
I can't believe you're out of the game. 
It's like picasso not painting, or bruce willis not combing action and rock harmonica. 
Don't you miss it? 
I do. 
That's why i'm forming a new company. 
Here's the pitch, wind power, bandwidth,chinese market. 
Oh,god. 
I'm funding the whole thing myself. 
Partners,oy. 
Jack... You're drooling. 
If you want in, i'll make a little room and pull some strings. 
This is the most exciting day of my life. 
And i was pulled onstage once to dance at a bruce springsteen concert. 
Welcome aboard. 
Just think, this time next year, you'll be so rich you can run for political office Without having to pretend to be a fundamentalist. 
Jack,the car is here. 
Liz... Thank you for coming. 
I really enjoyed yo cupcakes. 
And because my agoraphobia-related germ issues prevent direct human contact, I wonder if carl here might say good night to you for me? Carl? 
Good night,liz. I hope 
to see you again soon. 
Okay. good night. 
Guys,listen up...I just got a memo, 
saying that every floor in the building has to designate a floor emergency marshal for fires, Terrorist attacks, cloverfieldmonsters. 
I can't do it,because my head is too big for the helmet. 
So any volunteers? 
No,but you have a big head. 
 That's not a burn, i just said that. 
 Hey,guys. 
Cerie,is my phone ringing? 
It is. Wow,you have,like, dog ears. 
So are you going to... Okay. 
 Hello? 
 Hey,liz. It's gavin volure. 
Listen,i only took that napkin because i wrapped some chicken in it. 
That's not why i'm calling. 
I just had a good time with you the other night, And i wondered if you'd like to come out again this saturday? 
Are you having another party? 
No. 
Well... This must be what 
the kids call "a booty call." 
I haven't been out of the house since 2004, and even i know the kids don't call it that anymore. 
So,uh,what do you say? 
Um,yes. I guess. Right? 
Okay. I'll send a helicopter to 
take you to the train station. 
 Okay. 
 Bye. 
What the what? 
well,it's gonna be a beautiful sunny day, And we can expect much more of the same over the next few days. 
Authorities came to believe that the mendez brothers acted out of pure greed. 
The only thing standing between them and tremendous wealth was What? Say it! 
Their father. Jose mendez. 
My kids are going to kill me! 
Kenneth, what are you doing? 
Ah,hello,sir. 
I've been taking in laundry to make extra money. 
I just don't let myself read the t-shirts with off-color slogans. 
Laundry,kenneth? 
I know we pay you a living wage, i fought against it. 
Yes,sir... 
But i've had to send more money home lately. 
There are problems on the farm. 
After years of inbreeding, the pigs are getting violent. 
And the pig shield around the house has worn thin. 
Kenneth, how much money do you have in your savings? 
Well,let's see. 
 If you don't include confederate money? 
 4000 I'm going to invest that for you. 
A friend has presented me wi opportunity, and i want to include you. 
Oh,mr. Donaghy. Thank you,sir. 
After i invest this money, you'll be able to buy your folks a pig moat. 
Well,that would be great if pigs weren't excellent swimmers. 
Jack. 
Gavin volure just called and asked me out. 
I mean,in... For the weekend. 
I thought he might. 
He asked if we were involved, i said you used to have a thing for me, but you were getting over it. 
That is what's happening,right? 
Yeah. Listen... 
I kind of told him i'd go. 
You should, what's the problem? 
I don't know,i'm still tired from that dinner. 
And meeting someone new,ugh. 
All the nodding and smiling and sibling listing. 
And what's the upside? 
It works and you have to have a bunch of sex? 
Lemon,what do you want? 
Do you want to be alone for the rest of your life? 
No,i just wish i could start a relationship about 12 years in, When you really don't have to try anymore and you can just sit around together and goof on tv shows, And then go to bed without anybody trying any funny business. 
Lemon,don't overthink this. 
Gavin is a fabulous guy. 
If i were dating a man, he would be the top of my list with michael jordan, denzel washington,taye diggs... 
God,do i have a black thing? 
I do like him. 
Lemon,you're going to go to gavin's, and you're going to work this thing like a chinese gymnast. 
Wear something tight, force a smile, and lie about your age. 
Hey,guys. 
Daddy's home. 
Don't menendez me. 
We made the hockey team. 
And,uh,this is the study. 
This is interesting, uh,one of these benches is a priceless work of art, And the other is an ordinary bench from which to admire it. 
Which one's which? 
So you just never leave this house? 
I'm afraid not. And it does get lonely. 
I'd be lying if i told you i never danced with a broom. 
That's nothing,sometimes, to feel like i have company during dinner, I dispute credit card charges on speaker phone. 
Thanks for coming out. 
I know my situation is complicated, but i really enjoyed ur company the other night. 
I had a great time too. 
So with your agoraphobia, how does this work? 
Well,it's not easy. 
We can never leave the house, and we'd just probably sit around all weekend and watch tv. 
Go on. 
There's not much else to do up here but eat, and read celebrity gossip on the internet,  and nap the day away. 
 Really? 
And unfortunately, because of my phobias, we could never be physically intimate. I know. 
What wom would want all that? 
oh,hello,kenneth. Please,sit down. 
I'm sorry to bother you,mr. Donaghy. 
But i've got another $10. 
00 i'd like to invest. 
I did some street performing in my neighborhood this weekend. 
Kenneth,i'm very proud of you. 
Next stop,home ownership. 
I'm just kidding. The middle class 
is dying, you'll be renting forever. 
Um,let's just call my broker. 
Hey,jack. 
Hey,walter. I just want to check 
on that investment i made on friday. 
All right, let's pull it up. 
 Um,that account was closed out. 
 What? 
Yeah,zero balance as of this morning.I 
don't know what that hot tip was, but you'd have been better off putting that money in a coffee can. 
Hi,walter. This is kenneth 
parcell, nbc page program. 
Wh's the status ofmyinvestment? 
Gavin, this was wonderful. 
I really enjoyed watching mtv canada with you. 
Yeah. They can't seem to get 
anything right up there, can they? 
I hope y'll come back. 
Maybe next weekend? 
 I'd like that. 
 Me too. 
Well,i should go. 
Do you have everything? Do 
you have your cell phone? 
Nerds,where is it? 
Oh,uh, there it is in the other room. 
Carl... Could you get liz's cell phone 
for her so i can say a proper good bye? 
Thanks,buddy. 
Anyway,i just... 
 We don't have much time,liz. 
 What? 
Look,liz,i've decided i can trust you, so i'm going to tell you the truth. 
I'm not rely an eccentric agoraphobe, I just tell people that so they won't know i'm under house arrest for tax fraud. 
 And arson. 
 Volure. 
Ah,the wind must've blown it shut,carl. 
I'm searching for the key. 
Carl's a u.s.marshal. 
Come, before they shoot. 
I thought derek was upstairs. 
I miscounted the men,liz! 
I miscounted the men! 
Gavin,it's jack, please call me immediately. 
Also that joke answering machine message makes me really think you've picked up, So i start talking, and then it beeps, and,uh,i feel like a fool. 
Hey,your friend is a crook. 
He's under house arrest for tax fraud, embezzlement, and racketeering. 
What is racketeering? 
No one knows,lemon. 
And he's not a germaphobe! 
I thought i was helping him when i let him hold my boob while we watchedtop chef. 
Oh,i'm sorry. 
You should be. You made me go up there. 
Well,i'm going to fix this. I'm going to 
get kenneth his money back and for you, I'm going to hit gavin volure harder than a bottle of whiskey in an irish wake. 
Tracy, get out of the hallway. 
Or am i? 
Oh,god,this dream again? 
That's not me. 
That's the tracy jordan japanese sex doll. 
You can tell us apart because it's not suffering from a vitamin deficiency. 
Other than the natural inclination to make love to yourself, why did you get this? 
To use as a decoy. 
So my greedy children will murder it, and i'll be able to escape un-mendezed. 
This is insanity. 
Or is it? 
The parallels between the jordans and the menendi are uncanny. 
Both families are rich, both families have two sons, and both families are staples of court tv. 
Money does make people crazy, look at gavin. 
And he doesn't have the life-long scarring of an absentee father. 
Exactly! 
You want to get one? I can get you one. 
You've got ten seconds, volure. 
Sorry,jack,but i needed that money for my escape. 
And it's all gone. I 
spent it on disguises. 
What about your billions? 
What about sunstream? 
Sunstream is why i'm trped here. 
It's not a real company. 
You watch our commercials, we never actually say what we did. 
INNOVATION TOMORROW AMERICA SUNSTREAM You can't be broke, what about this house? 
The government owns this house. 
I share with three other white collar criminals. 
Hey,glenn, that's my peanut butter. 
God,you're pathetic. 
Creamy? This is-- this is not 
my peanut-- i'm sorry,glenn. 
I know,i'm pathetic. 
But i never meant to hurt liz. 
I miss her,jack. 
I miss her laughter, her voice, the sound of her scratching her dry elbow skin all the way up Damn it. 
I have got a serious case of the mondays. 
Gavin,you're going to have to make this thing right. 
I will,jack. I promise. 
We trusted you,gavin. 
I know,good point. 
And you betrayed us. 
Wow,that's wonderful news. 
Gavin? Gavin,what 
are you ing in the Yep. You and me both,pal. 
 I'll just be a minute. 
 Carl! 
God,these acoustics in here are fantastic. 
Tomorrow,tomorrow i love you tomorrow it's only a day uh,kenneth. 
I couldn't get your money back, and i'm sorry. 
I feel responsible, so i want you to have this. 
Mr. Donaghy, i can't take that. 
Well,what would this country be if our economy didn't allow wealthy people to take advantage of rubes? 
Well,yes,that's true. But 
what about your family? 
Ah,don't worry about us. 
We parcells have eaten our share of rock soup and squirrel tail. 
But we've also known lean times. 
We'll get by. 
Kenneth! 
I need someone to be our floor emergency marshal. 
And you came to me first? Thank you,sir! 
Uh,pete... 
Doesn't that responsibility come with a $4,000 signing bonus? 
Uh... Yes? 
Oh,right,i rember that meeting. 
Where you also said i would get a per diem for gas. 
Yes,yes,um... 
 12 cents a mile. 
 Yes! Hornberger! 
Yes,hornberger. 
Daddy? 
It begins. 
Daddy,are you awake? 
I keep having a scary dream. 
I dreamed that you would get so rich that you would leave us and get a new family. 
And never come back. And daddy... 
I don't want you to leave us. 'Cause i love you. 
I love you so much. 
I love you too,son! 
Stop it. Stop patriciding! 
It's me. 
There's nothing to be freaked out about. 
That's just some japanese sex doll in daddy's bed. 
Now,you listen. 
You don't have to ever worry about me leaving. 
'Cause i'll always be there to take care of you. 
And there's something else. 
If anything ever happens to me, you and your brother are going to go to jail. 
Liz lemon! Look! 
I'm not dead. 
 Good to know. 
 Yes,it is. 
 Also everything worked out with jenna's dad visiting. 
 What? 
Oh,you weren't really around for any of that. 
Cast to the stage for rehearsal. 
Hello,liz. 
Oh,my god! Gavin? 
We're supposed to be quiet during rehearsal. 
What are you doing here? 
I came back for you,liz. I was free. 
I was across the canadian border. 
No,you weren't. What-- what's 
the scam? Do you want money? 
No,i'm not lying. I can prove it,look. 
Cheap cholesterol medicine from canada. 
A paris hilton film released only in canada. 
Camp of approval? What 
does that even mean? 
Liz... What's the point of 
being free if you're alone? 
You get me. Come with me to canada. 
Toronto was just like new york, but without all the stuff. 
Absolutely not. 
Volure. 
I thought by now you'd be some place that u.s.law couldn't touch you, like bali or utah. 
What made you come back? 
The reason is standing right next to you. 
I came back for liz. 
 This isn't going anywhere, volure. 
 I already told him that. 
You've already done enough damage, taking advantage of her loneliness and her big ben-sized biological clock. 
 Oh,come on. 
 I'm stopping it. 
I can't believe i'm saying this to the great gavin volure, but liz lemon is too good for you. 
Oh,well, that is nice. 
It's over,volure. Give me the brush. 
You stay back. I swear i will paint you. 
I am not going torealprison. 
I've lost everything. 
I'm financially ruined, i've lost liz. 
That paint is drying weird, and now prison? 
Not prison. Not for gavin volure. 
What are you doing? 
Get down from there. 
Good god,volure, that's got to be 15, 16 feet! 
Everybody stand back. 
Gavin volure's going to jump. 
We need the floor emergency marshal! 
Gavin volure, everybody wanted to be gavin volure. 
 Volure,calm down. 
 Gavin,don't do this. 
All right,everyone, i'm in charge. 
Does anyone need water or saltines? 
I would feel safer with some saltines. 
I d the money, i had the yacht, i had the women. 
I had it all, and then i lost it. 
And now,i'm going to jump. 
Gavin,listen to me. 
I know you've had some setbacks lately. 
Glenn ate all my peanut butter. 
Gavin,i'm not going to lie to you, you'll probably be killed in the first six months of prison. 
but that's neither here nor there, The important thing is that you're alive now, which means there's hope. 
You know,you're making a lot of sense. 
Yes,you have to pay for the things you've done. 
You're not making sense anymore. 
In spite of everything, you still have friends who will stand by you. 
And more importantly... 
Perhaps most importantly of all... Now,tracy! 
what? But you're down there. 
Or am i? 
Good job,sex doll. 
he miscounted the men. 
You know, a lot of people look down on sex dolls. 
But as we saw tonight,they save lives and bring families together. 
How am i such an expert? 
I'm tracy jordan's sex doll. 
All right, Let's do this. 
=http://sfile.ydy.com= 
Thanks for coming out. 
Thanks for watching. 
Love,peace, and hair grease. 
Hey,liz me,lutz,toofer,and josh are gonna go to that bar where the waiters are dressed like ninjas. 
You in? 
No,I'm just gonna go to the 24-hour donut place and go home. 
All right. 
Donuts and then bed. 
What are you depressed about or celebrating? 
It's this endless adoption process.It took me three months 
liz. I am totally humiliated. 
How could you cut diaper chicken? 
Wait,i know. Because tracy's the star. 
Oh,brother, she's feeling neglected. 
How's she gonna act out th te? 
My ankle! 
Oh,imaginary injury. 
I would have said death of a voice coach. 
Her birthday's on tuesday. 
Maybe all that attention will make her ankle feel better. 
Hey,jack! What are you still doing here? 
It's friday night. I 
need something to do. 
Don't you have some gallery opening or a fundraiser to give bowties to inner city youths? 
Of course. But I'm committed to elisa. 
While she's away I'm trying to avoid temptation. 
I just need somewhere I can socialize where women aren't an issue. 
Finally! 
Hey,now.

30 Rock Season03 Episode13 Excuse me? 
Can we get a little service over here-- okay. 
Dude,i know you're getting these messages because I know how to check your voicemail. 
You are officially a d-bag,tim. 
I hope you lose your indoo sorry,what n I get you? 
A dozen assorted for me to take home to my family. 
And the lady will have... 
A dozen assorted. 
Adoption brochure. 
Should you be working the night shift alone like this? 
It's fine. They gave me a gun. 
That's $6.80 
I will have mine to stay, please. 
You want a dozen donuts to stay? 
And a skim milk. 
 What are you doing,liz? 
 Making a new friend. 
I don't like this. You have crazy eyes. 
You have shut-up mouth. 
 I don't want any part of this. 
 Enet out of here. 
Boy,that creative thing you guys do, writing jokes for a living, making the world laugh. 
What do your dads tell their friends you do? 
Surgeon. 
Optometrist. 
Died. 
I never really knew my dad. So I 
just lie to myself. Space assassin. 
I grew up without a father too,frank. 
Good ol' billy donaghy left when I was two. 
He'd show up every now and then to impregnate my mom, punch out umpires in my little league. 
Last time I saw my dad, he went out to get the candles for my fourth-birthday lasagna and never came back. 
My whole life I said I was gonna be something. 
Restore the glory of the rossitano name. 
In sicilian dialect, it means "well poisoner." 
In gaelic,donaghy means "dung basket." 
So I worked my ass off at s.u.n.y. Got into fordham law. 
No. You went to law school? 
Yeah. But I had to drop out after 
a semester 'cause my mom got sick. 
Mothers. 
So what are we doing next,fellas? Don't 
tell me we're calling it a night already. 
How lame do you think the night is young. 
We're going to lutz's to watch movies. 
Tonight,a classic. 
Harry and the hendersons. You in,jack? 
Uh,yes,but I don't wanna go to lutz's apartment. 
His contract is up and I don't wanna feel sorry for him. 
What do you say we go to my place? 
 I cado it. 
 Sounds good. 
And when I told tim I was pregnant, he just freaked out and didn't call me for a week. 
Then he texted me and he was like, "oh,i love you. 
No,I'm mad at you. You did 
this on purpose." As if. 
Meanwhile,his myface page horny." 
And I'm,like, if you ce out me at all, at least have the decency to skype me face to face. 
Man,there are just so many different devices for guys to not call you on now. 
When I was your age, you could just be like, "oh,he probably tried to call me but my line was busy." 
And then just watchfalcon crest and cry yourself to slee thanks for listening to me blab. 
So what's your plan when the baby comes? 
I don't know. 
I've been talking to an adoption lady, but I just don't feel comfortable with any of the people. 
They all just seem really old and wei. 
Not one of them even knew who neo is. 
* I need you * finally,thank you. 
Somebody cool for once. 
Geouof here! 
Can't you see we don't want you anymore? 
Why can't you go back where you came from? 
And leave us alone! 
Go. 
Go! 
Good-bye,my friend. 
He had to be mean to save him. 
Hay belonged in the woods. 
It gets me every time. 
This reminds me of my favorite movie. 
Shane. 
Aww,when joey wants to go with shane and shane makes him stay? 
Maybe it's because we didn't have fathers. 
Maybe at why we're drawn to movies where the father-figure pushes away the child/legendary north-american forest ape. 
Yeah,but in the movies, it's a good thing. 
Harry went back to the woods. 
It works out in real life too. 
We're both doing all right. 
Yeah. 
Excuse me,Mr. Jordan. 
I was just updating my staff birthday list and I discovered I don't have yours. 
That's because I don't have a birthday,ken. 
What? 
I don't have a birth certificate 'cause I was born inside of yankee stadium. 
I bound around foster families so much, no one ever bothered to throw me a party. 
Oh,but even prisoners have birthday parties. 
I saw one onoz. 
It was... Interesting. 
I don't need a birthday. 
'Cause I buy myself all the presents I need. 
And because of my drinking, they're often a surprise. 
Oh,but birthdays aren't about presents. 
They're about being surrounded by people who love you And eating a cake with your name on it and making a wish. 
I'm sad you never had that. 
My birthday's september 21st, not that anyone asked. 
Hi,frank. 
Oh,hey,jack. 
This morning it hit me in the shower why the hendersons named their guest harry. 
Yeah. 
That film has layers. 
I was also thinking about what you told me about your family and law school. 
Yeah,sorry. I was drunk. I 
shouldn't have told you that stuff. 
No,no,no. I'm glad you did. 
We have a lot in common. 
We both have recurring dreams about being overpowered by a female bodybuilder. 
Okay,we were both drunk. 
But I wanna help you. 
So I made some phone calls and if you want, you can resume your law studies at columbia, This semester,full schorsp, no strings attached. 
Are you serious? 
Make your mother proud, frank. 
Make your father hate any new children he might have. 
But... I've got a whole other life now. 
I guess. 
But we both know you shouldn't be wki at a desk with... 
Fake vomit on it. 
Right. Fake. 
Excuse me. 
Oh,god,please don't be a daughter I didn't know about. 
Becca! 
Congratulations. 
What is she doing here? 
She is the show's new youth consultant. 
It's a thing. The cw has them. 
Oh,my god. 
I can't believe you're in charge of all of this. 
It is challenging and satisfying but it can't fulfill all of me. 
I've got so much more to give. 
Welcome. 
Um,so do you want me to start youth consulting now? 
Because kids would not be into that. 
Oh,lutz? Yeah,that guy's the worst. 
Kenneth,this is the dress i'll be wearing to my birthday party. 
Please maksure no one else plans to wear the same thing. 
Yes,ma'am. 
Did you know Mr. Jordan has 
never had a birthday party? 
He was too poor growing up. 
Oh,that's horrible. 
My heart goes out to all the inner city kids. 
Especially those too fat to dance their way out. 
I'm glad you feel that way, 'cause we have ts g party planned for you. 
I know. 
Oc and we thought you could share it with Mr. Jordan. 
The party, the attention,everything. 
Isn't that a great idea? 
That's so great. 
I can't believe tim hasn't called. 
I guess I don't even care about us anymore. 
But this is his baby. 
I mean,him not even being there for the kid is totally washed. 
Typical tim. 
Anyway. I guess I have two choices. 
Go back home, try to get back with tim and keep the baby, Or give up the baby and focus on my music. 
So,tim,keep baby. 
Music,give up baby. 
Can I play you one of my songs? 
* Now we are joined in a cobweb of rainbows * stop.Stop right there. Tears. 
The world needs to hear your music. 
You have crossed a line, liz lemon. 
Becca's never gonna make it with those songs. 
Says who? Being terrible has never 
prevented success in the music business. 
Look at biz markie or the doors. 
Look,before we were happily married with five kids, paula and I were tim and becca. 
30an she is confused and he is terrified. 
 He ran away,pete. 
 So did i. 
Five times. But I came back. 
And when my caveman brain saw those babies with their little hornberger foreheads, it clicked. 
You gotta give tim and becca the same chance. 
Hey,what are you doing? 
My pregnant teen message board says the baby gets all its food from the mother, So you have to give it stuff it likes. 
No,the baby can't taste anythi it just gets nutrients from you. 
I'm gonna post a reply to juno32 and tell her she's a giant asswipe. 
I can't believe you don't have kids. 
What's that? 
Well,you'd make such a great mom. 
You're smart,succesul, grounded. 
Aw,go on. 
 You already dress like a mom. 
 And stop. 
It's not the right time for me to have a family. 
But is that something you'd want? 
Yeah,becca. It is. 
 Will you sing with me,liz?  Oh,i'd ra 
* mothers and fathers hm and jugglers and judges * * now we are joined in a cobweb of rainbows * he's coming! The plan is 
working! I bit my tongue! 
Surprise Oh,what a schmo, entering first. 
Now I'm the headliner and he's just the warm-up act. 
I'm Mr. Don rickles and he's just me. 
But I don't have a birthday! 
You do now 'cause we all love you and wanted you to feel isoy. 
I do feel it. 
You're all so amazing. 
And to think I was just calling y'all a bunch of racists. 
Stop. Jenna time. 
 Friends. 
 Frank? 
I am leaving tgs for columbia law school to pursue my dream of becoming a lawyer. 
Did you know that if you sing happy birthday on a tv show you have to pay for it? 
I did not know that. 
my dad got us all seats for opening day at the new yankee stadium! 
Cerie,cerie,cerie, cerie,cerie! 
No one ask me about my back brace. 
Make a wish,Mr. Jordan. 
Blow out the candles. 
Cerie,frank,and tracy! 
Cerie,frank,and tracy! 
No one ask me about my back brace! 
 Hey,jack. 
 Frank. 
Is that you? 
I decided to take you up on your offer. 
Good man,and you went to my tailor. 
That's the same cut reagan wore the day he got shot. 
My mom is going nuts. 
She's insisting you come over and let her cook you dinner. 
Home cooked italian? I'm there. 
Now let me hear you say the seven most important words in the american judicial system. 
My client has no memory of that. 
I also would have accepted, "you can't prove that's the governor's semen." 
 Okay. 
 Yes! 
What's the matter, Mr. Jordan? 
I know you only make cheese friends when something's bothering you. 
You were right,ken. 
Birthdays are special. 
And now mine's over. And who knows 
when february 24th will come again? 
Now that warm, happy feeling is gone, there's no cake in my mouth, and that birthday wish is malarkey. 
Malarkey! 
Come on,daniel. 
I am so proud of you. A lawyer. 
Someday you'll have and on the subway in english and spanish. 
Yeah. 
And this man. 
What you have done for my boy. 
Frankie,go open up some more wine. 
You got it,mom. 
What do you think you're doing to my boy? 
I'm trying to help him. 
I see myself in frank. 
I mean,we both have fathers that abandoned us. 
What do you know about his father? 
You want frank to be a lawyer so he won't be like his father? 
His father was a lawyer! 
And his father's father. 
All the rossitano men are lawyers. 
It's in their blood to be lawyers! 
 Then what's the-- - for the mob! 
What? 
Frankie's father didn't abandon him. 
He's in hiding in phoenix. 
Every rossitano man is either in hiding or six feet under. 
You want me to paint you a picture? 
'Cause I did! 
It's part of a therapy-through-painting thing. 
I had no idea. 
Well,you shoulda guessed. 
I don't think I should have. 
Whatever. 
I am not gonna take my kid's dream away from him. 
You made this mess, you clean it up. I don't care how. 
But francis rossitano cannot become a lawyer. 
Yeah,hold on a second. 
Liz. Do you know a tim? 
What? Why? 
Security says that there's a tim baker downstairs. 
Here? Heame here? That's 
becca's ex-boyfriend. 
Tell them to send him to 15. 
He's coming to steal my baby. 
 Don't even ask about the wheelchair. 
 Okay. 
Also, my old vocal coach died! 
Come on,come on, come on,come on. 
Lemon,are you okay? 
That pregnant girl, she was going to give me her baby. 
But now that dad is here, he's g what are you about to do? 
I'm the one who's been there for becca for almost two days. 
This tim guy is totally washed! 
Lemon,there was once a great american named george henderson. 
He met a woodland ape, or sasquatch, and despite its dangerous message of environmentalism, became his friend. 
When the time came to do the hard thing and send it back into the forest Where it belonged and birds could perch on its shoulder because it was gentle, George henderson summoned the strength and by god,he did it. 
Did it hurt? You bet 
it hurt. Like a bastard. 
But he did it because it was the right thing to do... 
For the woodland ape. 
You think about that. 
What? 
Is that harry and the hendersons? 
You've seen it? 
This is my life,jack. 
Oh,my! Miss maroney, are you okay? 
Well,i think i'll be okay in time for tomorrow's show. 
But then I have to go in forore tests. 
I'm so brave. 
Oh,i wish you felt better so you could help us figure out what Mr. Jordan's 
birthday wish coulda been. 
What? Why? 
So we can make it come true and his birthday can go on and on. 
We've narrowed it down to wn a robocop, "hunt that elephant that paints, or breakfast in bed." 
But it wasn't his birthday. 
It was my birthday. 
Oh,forget it. 
I'm tired of making you people try to care for me. 
You don't care for me, clearly. Nobody does. 
 My birthday wish came true! 
 What? 
I wished for you to get better. 
I was gonna wish for breakfast in bed with robocop while a elephant paints us. 
We were close. 
But then I saw you with that back brace on right before I blew out my candles. 
It's a birthday miracle! 
Tracy, that's the kindest thing anyone's ever done for me. 
Now let's make miss maroney's birthday wish come true. 
Oh,that's so sweet. 
But who would I celebrate with if y'all were in a car accident? 
Are you tim? Becca's tim? 
I'm her friend,jenna. And 
she does not wanna see you. 
She's very mad and she wants you to leave. 
Okay. That's,uh... 
That's for the best. Yeah. 
Excuse me. What floor 
is the sci-fi channel on? 
Fine,lithgow. I'll do 
the right thing. God! 
I guess someone's been watching the world according to garp. 
Damn it,tim,wait. Becca 
does wanna see you. 
She wants more than anything,okay? 
No,when you said she didn't wanna see me, it was such a relief. 
This baby thing is freaking me out. 
You know how many people want what just got dropped in your lap? 
"oh,now's not a good time. 
I wanna go to burning man." 
Shut up,tim! Do you love becca? 
She's,like,my soul mate. 
 I mean,in another life  you're not listening,dummy! 
Nut up right now, get a job, and help raise that kid. 
Love it because it has your goony face and get married And have disposable cameras at the wedding because it's fun and people like it. 
Where are we going? I 
already cleaned out my office. 
You've gotta go back where you belong. 
You've gotta go. 
No,I'm gonna be a lawyer. 
I'm going to be like you. 
Get outta here! Go to the writer's 
room! There is no scholarship! 
Can't you see we don't want you anymore? 
Think about it,tim. 
Do you really want your kid to grow up without a father? 
Jack,i don't understand. 
Why don't you go back where you came from? 
Leave me alone! 
Good-bye,my friend. 
Those two,they both grew up without fathers. 
Hey,baby. 
My god. Look at your boobs. 
Kiss or something. Go on. 
* Rainbows and the cobwebs and the cobwebs of the rainbows * and stop. 
I guess,in a way, we both lost children today. 
Yeah,but mine was real, jack. Yours was frank. 
Don't worry,lemon. 
I'm confident that someday you'll have everything you want. 
Can someone please tell me how to g out of this building? 
It-- it's like a maze! 
I keep walking past the same... Sbarro's! 
Yeah. 
I'm a celebrity! Please! 
Sad. 
Which of these pictures do you like better? 
Um,the one on the left? 
So the wacky one. 
Sure. What's the picture for? 
I'm giving the keynote address at the company's six sigma retreat to move forward in croton-on-hudson. 
Is that like a corporate retreat? 
I used to have to perform at those all the time back when jenna and i were in that improv troupe. 
The audience suggestion is sling blade and oprah on a date. 
I sure do like them french fried paters. 
no,you don't,oprah. 
Jenna is not a great improviser. 
To be honest,lemon,uh, i'm a little apprehensive about going to this thing. 
I haven't seen a lot of these people since the ceo debacle and my... 
Time in the... Bush administration. 
Yeah,jack,you never really told me what happened in washington. 
Please be gentle. 
The point is a lot has happened to me since the retreat last year. 
So i hope that when i return, they still think of me as the same guy. 
 You've got camp jitters. 
 What? 
You haven't seen your little business camp friends in a year, And now you're afraid everybody's gonna think you got weird. 
Uh,lemon,the retreat to move forward is a global meeting of ge's best and brightest. 
Careers are made there. 
It would be helpful to have someone with me who's got my back. 
Ugh,no. Don't make me 
be your camp friend. 
I hate those corporate things. 
Bunch of drunk people talking about synergy. 
First of all, never badmouth synergy. 
And i'm asking you to do this as a favor. 
Oh,fine! I'll go. For you. 
 As long as this place has a spa... 
 They do. 
Where you are allowed to eat in the sauna. 
Because at some places, they get mad.

Or depending on how some legal matters pan out, A janis joplin-type character named janet jopler or janie jimplin.

Because i will be employing the "method" method of acting. 
So for the next few weeks, i will only reon to "janis" or "miss joplin." 
If you're nasty. 
If anyone has anything to say to me,jenna, now would be your last chance. 
Oh,your hands are weird. 
I don't think you went to high school. 
I'm not busy friday. I just said i was. 
Okay. I am janis now. 
You are all saying those things to janis joplin. 
The veil is drawn. 
You should do your janis research on wikipedia. 
It's online, so anyone can update it. 
You know,'cause people are finding out new things about janis joplin every day. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
Oh,thank you,frank. Wikipedia. 
I'm gonna check that out. 
Okay,i'm on wikipedia. Edit page. 
Did you know that janis joplin speed walked everywhere and was afraid of toilets? 
I ve heard that. Yes. 
Was she really? 
So how am i lookin', dr. Spaceman? 
Well,tracy,i-i don't know how to say this. 
Dee-ay-buh-tees. 
 Diabetes? 
 That's it. 
Well,now we know what we're dealing with. 
Unless you make some serious lifestyle changes, You're in danger of becoming diabetic. 
So how bad is diabetes, really? 
It's quite serious. 
If left untreated, you could lose a foot. 
Could i replace it with a wheel, like rosie fromthe jetsons? 
I suppose. 
But then you'd have to register as a motor vehicle. 
Well,buddy,here we go. Bases 
loaded. Bottom of thninth. 
Are you gonna step up? Oh,yeah. 
Because it's winning time, you magnificent son of a bitch! 
You go in there and show them. 
Make mommy proud of her big boy because he's the best. 
Just do it. Is it in you? I'm loving it! 
Are you okay? 
Oh,i'm sorry, i was just,uh... 
Were you psyching yourself up in the mirror? 
I do that sometimes before i go to a party where i don't know a lot of people. 
Stop sweating,you idiot. 
What is wrong with you, you stupid bitch! 
I wish you hadn't sn that. 
It's okay. Now you're ready to 
get in there. You're psyched up. 
You got your camp buddy. Just do it. 
You are a lion. Take what's yours. 
There they are the six sigmas themselves. 
They're dudes? 
Each of them embodies a pillar of the six sigma business philosophy. 
Teamwork. 
Insight. 
Brutality. 
Male enhancement. 
Handshakefulness. 
And play hard. 
Wish me luck. 
Men,if i'd known your wives were alone, i would've stayed in new york. 
Jack donaghy. We've been waiting 
all day for you to show up. 
 Uh,this is my friend  guys over in war machines have been dying to see you. 
The finulus data sugst r ocwe should be leveraging disintermediation paradigms. 
Well,obviously, the finular analysis will concur with any synergized mindshare classifications. 
Bladorian frankles. 
I'm liz. 
I'm prashant. This is joan. 
We're m-7s. What level are you? 
Ohno i'm just here with my friend. Or i was. 
So you're like a g or an h? 
No,i'm not part of this. I'm not any letter. 
J? 
Morning,mr. Jordan. What's 
that on your foot,sir? 
It's a practice wheel for when i lose my foot to diabetes. 
You can't eat candy if you have diabetes. 
There's no link between diabetes and diet. 
That's a white myth,ken. 
Like larry bird or colorado. 
It's not a myth. 
Gentlemen, back me up here. 
I don't know. 
My dad had diabetes, and he ate whatever he wanted until he died on the day i was born. 
How do you not see the connection? 
You know, there's a conspiracy theory that after the civil war, the u.s.government spread false 
information about diabetes  Word.  To keep the newlyfreed 
slaves sluggish and docile. 
 And i heard that from yusef jackson. 
 Which is why to this day, most african americans don't understand that diabetes is caused by sleeping on your back. 
I don't think that's right. 
Diabetes and diet. 
Next you'll be telling me that leasi a sports car is a bad investment! 
Hey,nice suit, squaresville. 
Where's the bank? 
What can i do for you miss... Jimplin? 
Well,according to my wikipedia page, i'm gonna need some crrjuice, Buttermilk,and tequila to make my signature janis joplin cocktail, the frankschlong. 
Good grief. 
Hey,jack, where you been hiding? 
Oh,lemon,there you are. 
I'm sorry i got distracted. 
Yeah. Se your camp buddy. 
I know. It's going great. I'm actually 
joining the six sigmas for lunch. 
Oh,okay. I like lunch. 
Right. Yes. Well... Join us. 
Okay. 
What is this? 
It's l.u.n.c.h.lego utilization 
for negating cris hierarchies. 
It's a competive teambuilding exercise where one person directs his teammates in the construction of a lego model That only he can see. 
Lemon,why don't you join team donaghy? 
We'll win this thing, and then we'll go to c.l.a.s. 
I don't want to go to a class. 
No,lemon,c.l.a.s. It's an acronym for 
"consuming lunch and simple socializing." 
now that just seems intentionally confusing. 
K. 
What's up with this disgusting stuff? 
Mr. Jordan, i've seen too many folks back 
home die of diabetes and go-kart accidents to sit idly By while you ruin your health. 
You need teat better. 
N- o-e. 
No. E. 
Okay,mr. Jordan. Whatever you like. 
I just hope don't you get eaten by the hill witch. 
Hmm? What's that? 
I didn't say anything. 
Oh,you want to hear tell of the hill witch? 
My meemaw saw her once taking away a boy who wouldn't eat his vegetables. 
She's a shriveled crone, 1,000 years old. 
One look turns you to stone, and then she gorges your living brain. 
Through the stone? 
Really,ken? That was your plan. 
Doubt me if you dare. 
But beware the omens of her coming. 
Crops will fail. 
Animals will run wild. 
And my page desk will be turned sideways. 
frank,you have got to check out maroney. 
Ur wikipedia prank is inspired. 
Okay,janis did it. 
You can do it. 
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna eat this cat. 
Janis,don't! That's 
fromalf. Alf ate cats. 
What? 
I put all that stuff on wikipedia. 
None of it's true. 
W-- why would you do that? 
I'm sorry. I didn't know you 
were gonna take it so seriously. 
Well,of course i'm taking it seriously. 
This is my chance to win an oscar. 
The academy loves dead singers and the handicapped, and janis was both. 
No,she wasn't. Her 
legs bent the right way. 
What? 
I speed walked home on these. 
You pathetic load! 
You mess with me because your life is miserable. 
Because you're disgusting! 
What? 
Nothing. Just,you're 
yellin' at me. You're a mess. 
You're joplined out on tequila. 
It's kinda workin' for me. 
Are you turned on right now? What is wrong with you? 
I've got a thing for damaged goods. 
But if you can get this raw in the movie, you are gonna win really? 
Two minutes. 
Don't stop talking, jack. Always be talking! 
Hands in pockets,joan. 
Prashant,your job is to watch joan. 
Say something,haircut. 
Well,you can't have more wheels on one side than the other. 
Uh-doyee! 
It goes on top. It's a smokestack. 
Yeah! 
Suck it,nerds! 
 What happened to you, donaghy? 
 What do you mean? 
That woman is a subordinate of yours. 
Her behavior is totally inappropriate. 
Familiarity. Nicknameification. 
And you seem to encourage it. 
Well,lemon is unique. 
Okay. 
But the old jack donaghy wouldn't have stood for that. 
Sorry! I dropped it when i 
was pretending it was my penis! 
Robot penis. 
We won! 
Oh,hey,jenna. 
Um,about last night... 
Oh,god. 
I just want to make sure you haven't told anyone what happened. 
I have a lot of irons in the fire around he. 
You'll keep it to yourself, right? 
Oh,yes. Of course. Thank you. 
Yeah. 
Wait. I'm sorry. You don't 
want people to know about us? 
Oh,god,no. I mean, it's so embarrassing. 
Yeah,for me. You should 
want to brag about it. 
Don't worry about that. Last 
night was stupid. Stupid,frank! 
No,last night was the best thing that's ever happened to you. 
It was my mistake, not yours. 
I'm the one who had to take the silkwood shower this morning. 
Okay,fine. Whatever. But 
you'll be cool about this? 
You... The one... Who cool... Should be. 
Oh,all right. Cool. 
Wha-- what the hell was that? 
First of all, ere's an omelet bar downstairs. 
So you should probably go get yourself an omelet. 
Second,i want to see if your room is bigger than mine. 
Oh,you have a sitting area? You jag. 
Uh,please come in. 
Lemon,i give u a certain amount of leeway at work. 
But while we're here, i need you to behave appropriately. 
What are you talking about? 
Well,the,uh,nicknames, the arm punching, the familiarity. 
The way you were behaving at l.u.n.c.h. 
You can't say "uh-doyee" to me in mixed company. 
Okay. 
So when i helped you win that lego thing when i thought we were having fun together, I was actually embarrassing you, is that right,jack? 
While we're here,i need you to call me mr. Donaghy. 
I get it. 
You broughme here in case you need me. 
But now that you have your cool six sigma friends, I can go back to the lake with the fat kids and make bracelets. 
Lemon,you know how important this is to me. I've got my speech tonight. 
Yeah,don't worry. I get boundaries. 
Ooh,sorry,liz,my parent's basement only has room for five sleeping bags. 
Or,no,i'll come over after prom and we'll make nachos together. 
Lemon,this is a part of our problem. 
I give you a simple managerial suggestion in a professional context, And i get back the second half of a judy blume novel. 
Whatever. This place is dumb. 
We're gonna be back at work tomorrow. 
Let's not make this bigger than it is. 
Too late. Friendship over. 
Good lor like a waitress. 
Mr. Jordan,i am begging you, 
as a friend,to eat better. 
I just don't want to see anything bad happen to you. 
I'm fine,ken. 
I have so much energy, my hand keeps dancin'.

I need to put a microphone on you for your speech. 
I can't believe you don't want to sit with jack donaghy. 
He's not that great. 
You guys are my friends. 
We should start calling ourselves the three musketeers. 
Not. 
That's a good one, prashant. 
So i heard about you and frank. 
Ugh,i know. It's hard to believe. 
Now dog the bounty hunter's the second grossest guy i've been with. 
You shouldn't have done that with frank,jenna.

And i think it actually worked. 
A lot of people from the conference emailed me to ask if i was there when the bra lady went crazy. 
They completely forgot about me, so thank you. 
Sure. 
And i think it goes without saying that you are banned from any future retreats i can't believe you did that for me. 
That's what friends do, jack. 
Uh-doyee! 
Hello,pussycat! 
Oh,really? 
Lot of ladies get right in the car after that line, you creepy piece of jack! 
 What are you  oh,i'm sorry.

How did you get out of your government job? 
Um,i'm not at liberty to discuss that. 
That information is classified. 
At least until cheney dies, which is gonna be a long time from now. 
That man is mostly metal. 
The important thing is that i'm here, and i'm gonna get my old job back. 
Yes,please come back,jack! 
Devin is the worst. 
It's like he doesn't he even care when we should have cake for people's whose birthdays are on the weekend. 
The friday before. At lunch. 
So what's with the outfit,lemon? 
Did the people from that makeover show finally respond to your letter? 
No,i am dressed up because the adoption agency is doing my home evaluation today. 
Just be yourself,lemon. 
I'm gonna be better than myself. 
My apartment is spotless. 
I have practiced all my answers. 
I got rid of all my colin firth movies in case they consider them erotica. 
That man can wear a sweater. 
There is no chance that i'm blowing this.

Devin,i know we've had our battles in the past, But i want to offer my assistance to you and kathy. 
Oh,that's funny,jack. 
You see,the only thing that kathy and i need assistance with is deciding which john mayer song to do it to. 
Oh,come on,banks. 
You sold off small appliances. 
Sheinhardt wigs missed projections for last quarter. 
I hear that that theme park fire di't destroy any of the stuff it was supposed to. 
Rumor has it you're in over your head. 
Well,you know what they say about rumors,jack. 
They make a "ru" out of "mor" and "s." 
Yes,we've had some setback. 
But kathy and i have everything under control. 
No! 
Don't even think about talking to her when her soaps are on! 
Seriously, she will bite you. 
You owe me a job,banks. 
You know her father wanted me to takeover before he slipped into that coma. 
If there's one thing i learned from you,jack, it's keep your friends close... 
And your enemies so close that you're almost kissing. 
So-- ahem-- that's why i'm gonna offer you a job. 
In the mailroom.

I don't know. I think i did it alone. 
And this check is the prizznoof. 
Now that one was just him being obnoxious. 
Thank you. 
Jack? 
I'm back,lemon. 
Devin thought he could humiliate me, But he doesn't understand that i worked my way up from the bottom before, And i can do it again. 
The last time took me 22 years, but i know so much more now this time. 
I think i can do it in nine. 
So you're gonna be a mailroom guy. 
I'm the head mailroom guy. 
I've already been promoted once since this morning. 
That's pretty fast. 
With a little hard work, i think i'll be back to vp status before i'm 60. 
And if my home evaluation goes well, i will be a mother by 50. 
 We really can have it all. 
 Yeah. 
What was your reason for wanting to adopt? 
Thank you for that question,bev. 
The world is a troubled place, and with so many children in need of adoption worldwide  so... 
"infertility" or "other?" 
Other. 
 How old are you,liz? 
 37 I should tell you right now it's important that you don't lie. 
How often do you entertain gentlemen sex guests? 
Oh,boy,that's once a year,maybe. 
But i'd be open to cutting that down. 
Is that a safety thing? 
Because i can fix that. 
You ever run a webcam ring out of here,liz? 
Gentlemen tell you what to do,you do it? 
At first with some feigned hesitation? 
No! Is that on the form? 
Haveou ever been convicted of a crime? 
I was arrested once in germany for public nudity. 
I thought it was a topless beach. It was a shipyard. 
You're a tv writer,liz. 
How many hours per week do you work? 
Between 60 and 80. 
 Is that a work call? 
 Could be. 
Or it could be my annual sex guest. 
Your work life seems very demanding. 
Maybe i should pop by there tomorrow. 
Uh,ms. Geiss,i have 
yoursoap opera digest. 
Kathy,this can't be easy for you. 
Your father, such a great leader, trapped in a coma. 
All this responsibility heaped on your... 
Young shoulders. 
With all due respect to devin, he's a party boy with a grown man's job. 
He can't handle it. 
I want to be of service. 
Let me help you. 
can i have everyone's attention,please? 
Hi,there's-- there is a woman coming by the office today... 
No,stop it. Uh,her name is bev, and 
she is evaluating me for an adoption. 
Morons. 
I need everyone to be on their best behavior. 
No cursing. Please take down any 
pornography that you have in your office. 
Nothing weird. 
Oh,come on. It's movie party thursday. 
I brought in my tape of circus accidents. 
No,no. 
Please,a lion eats a sad clown. 
Tomorrow. 
Please just be normal-sauce for one day. 
And change that hat. 
Pete,i need you to call the set design guys and have them make the green room into a nursery. 
I may have lied about some stuff. 
Liz. 
I have a serious issue. 
Oh,i told you not to write back to your stalker. 
Oh,no,this is not about yolanda. 
Listen,tracy keeps bragging about all the money he's making off of his stupid video game. 
Meanwhile,those of us who did the voice acting weren't even compensated. 
I mean,i don't do anything for yolanda,and she sends me those headless dolls. 
Well,i was not supposed to say anything, but he has something very special planned. 
Oh,i'll believe that when i see it. 
Well,you will see, and then you are gonna be embarrassed that we had this conversation. 
Can i hide this box of penis pasta in your dressing room? 
Lemon. 
 She touched me. 
 Who? 
Kathy geiss. She touched 
me in my swimsuit area. 
No! Kathy? 
It made me very uncomfortable. 
It's not all erotic and fun, like when men do it to women. 
Have you ever been sexually harassed? 
 Of course not. 
 Of course not. 
i mean,how far would i have to let her go to get my old job back? 
Are we talking over the shirt? Frontsies,backsies? 
Or would i really have to give her my gift? 
Oh,what am i talking about? 
I can't go through this. 
If i pleasure kathy to get my old job, i'm no better than devin. 
The only path is the virtuous path. 
Even if it takes five years. 
I thought you said nine years. 
I was promoted again this morning. 
I'm now director of mail systems. 
Nice work,hornberger. Are these dolls? 
Are they? 
Mommy! 
They're called little creepers. 
Oh,is it so wrong that i just want to have one of these to grow up and resent me? 
Oh,you will. 
Hey,tracy,did you see that thing in the paper today about how lil wayne that's a person,ight? 
Anyway,lil wayne, every time one of his albumsdrops, He buys diamond watches for everybody that worked on it. 
I know what you're hinting at,liz lemon. 
I should get my rap career going again. 
All in due time. 
No,i want you to get presents for everyone who helped you with your video game. 
Especially jenna. 
Noblesse oblige,yes. 
Let's go shopping. To the batmobile! 
Don't worry. He's just leasing it. 
Oh,good. 
What i'm saying is don't dress for the job you have. 
Dress for the job you want to have.So now,manny 
tomorrow i'll show up for work dressed as a mexican wrestler. 
Well Banks? 
Good god,what are you dog here? Where are your shoes? 
Oh,damn it. 
Must've left them in my business meeting. 
Banks,you've gotta get a hold of yourself. You've got a company to run. 
Oh,i'm running it. 
I have a plan to quadruple profits by the year 2015. 
How are you possibly going to do that? 
The old-fashioned way,jack. 
I'm gonna shut it down. 
I'm gonna shut the whole thing down for two years. 
I mean,imagine how badly people'll want light bulbs then. 
Are you insane? 
Think about the jobs, the economy. This is ge! 
It's just "g" now,jack. I sold the 
"e" to samsung. They're samesung now. 
I was supposed to be at a board mting five hours ago. 
Which way's connecticut-- oh! 
May i help you. 
Ah,i'm bev. 
I'm here to do liz's adoption evaluation. 
Oh,of course. 
I think adoption is a wonderful thing. 
Three of my nine siblings were adopted. 
And someday i'm gonna find them. 
Bev,hi! Thank you,kenneth. 
So this our studio. 
It would be a really fun place for a kid to grow up. 
Lots of costumes and  watch out,idiot! 
 Nice job,jackass! 
We're like a big family here. Hey,rick! 
I'm fred. Rick is the other black guy. 
Happens to everyone, right,bev? 
Yeah,happens all the time to my black husband. 
Well,i first met liz in 1993. 
She was fresh out of college,and i had just broken up with o.j.simpson. 
And can i just say something? 
Total gentleman. 
Liz is a really,really mature person. 
And she totally deserves to get custody of her kids. 
It's not a custody case.Liz 
is trying to adopt a child. 
Then who were those kids that you were yelling at the other day? 
Those were some child actors who had lied about being able to break-dance. 
Actually,i lived with liz while i was separated from my wife. 
In a platonic way. 
Um,but i haven't lived there for a couple months now Because i've been in an anger management treatment center 'Cause i shot one of my coworkers with an arrow. 
I think it's a circus in the philippines. 
The lion goes nuts and attacks this older clown. 
How did we get started talking about this? 
Did you bring it up? 
I'm so sorry.Would you 
excuse us for a moment,please? 
How is your thing going? 
Not terrific. 
I'm not sure that she's lemon,i don't have five years. 
What? 
Devin's lost it. 
I've gotta stop him before this whole thing implodes. 
He wants to shut down the entire company. 
What are you talking about? 
I've gotta go now while devin's in connecticut. 
I'm doing this for the greater good. 
What are you saying? 
I'm going upstairs... 
Todoinkkathy geiss. 
tracy jordan's not here right now. 
But he's great.It's a shame 
you won't get toeet him. 
Attention,everyone! 
Hey,great. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved in making my video game The most profitable thing since the war on terror. 
Yes,i am provocative. 
Frank,for all your hard work,please accept this set of solid gold nunchackus. 
I will use these only for good. 
Petey pete,for letting us use the sound booth, please accept this chinchilla coat. 
You're gonna get so much nice-nice in that you're gonnaave to grow an another ding Tracy,this is bev. 
The lady from the adoption thing. 
Bev... 
Now you look out for my girl,liz lemon, 'Cause me and her go way back like spinal cords and car seats. 
That's not really an expression. 
Mr. Banks? 
I thought you were going to connecticut today. 
I blew it off. 
Nice to see you,liz.Let's 
chitchat.What's that? 
Man trouble,boot-cut jeans?Fun,bye! 
Kenneth,it is imperative that you keep mr. 
Banks down here until i can get to jack. 
Do you know what "imperative" means? 
Tell me,tell me! 
Rock important.It means important. 
I'll just be a minute,bev! 
Mr. Banks,look how 
many pushups i can do. 
Devin'here! 
Cover yourself. 
You smell like strawberries. 
That's the lip gloss she put on me so i could be her fancy boy. 
Is this the way my life was supposed to play out? 
The kid who walked four miles every saturday to caddy Because mother said that golf was a game for businessmen? 
Paid his way through princeton by working the day shift at that graveyard And the graveyard shift at the days inn? 
22 years of single-mindedly fighting my way to the top of this company. 
Thank god i don't have your biological need for children. 
That would make success impossible. 
Thanks. 
This job was all i've ever wanted,lemon. 
And now it hinges on how far i'm willing to go with a woman in dora the explorer panties that were clearly made for an obese child. 
Are you sure she wants sex?Maybe 
she's just looking for attention. 
I mean,her whole world is stuffed unicorns and soap operas. 
Aren't soap operas all about sex? 
No,no way. 
No,the best part of a soap opera is when someone's twin interrupts a wedding Or somebody pulls a gun at the fitness center. 
Hold on a second. 
Kathy's texting me now. 
She's wondering where my strawberry mouth is. 
Oh,nerds,it's bev. 
Please be charming. 
Hello,bev.I'm jack donaghy. 
Have you had a tour of our magnificent studio? 
I have not. 
Right this way. 
This is what you're giving me as a "thk you" gift--Some coupons for free hugs? 
I'm suing you for my share of your video game profits,tracy. 
You're gonna sue me? 
Would you like to see the green room? 
Who do you think you are,the san diego zoo? 
You mean the nursery! 
We gotta get this stuff back to the rental place by 5:00. 
I love you!Mommy,i love you! 
Rock dear god. 
Ms.lemon,did you lie to me 
about their being a nursery here? 
No! 
Rick,what are you doing? 
Bitch,my name is fred. 
This is very disturbing,liz. 
This is a very serious breach of trust. 
Bev,allow me to explain. 
I've been mentoring lemon for some time now. 
Are you her boss? 
No,i work in the mail room. 
Kathy,bev and i are just friends! 
Kathy's the new ceo of our company. 
Bev,you better run! 
She's surprisingly strong! 
Frank,i told you to change that hat! 
Oh,god,how can i have a kid here? 
I can't even keep a grown woman safe in this place. 
"unsatisfactory"? 
Are you okay,bev? 
You had quite a fall there. 
Ah,i'm bev. 
I'm here to do liz's adoption evaluation. 
Why,yes,hello,bev. 
Did you just get here? 
Yes,i'm here to do liz's adoption evaluation. 
Where's my clicky pen? 
I get a do-over. 
No,we have to take her to a hospital. 
No,20 minutes. 
Just give me 20 minutes. 
Do-over,do-over! 
She doesn't remember anything. 
You heard what the lady said.We're taking a mulligan. 
Let's make this one count now. 
It's time,lemon. 
Kathy's texting me that devin's gone.I have to go upstairs. 
What are you gonna do? 
I'm gonna give kathy the full soap opera while you try to trick a lady with a head injury. 
We might not be the best people. 
But we're not the worst. 
Graduate students are the worst. 
Hi,i'm bev.Let's get stard. 
Right this way! 
I know liz would be a wonderful mother... 
Because she's intelligent and kind. 
She reminds me of my own mom. 
Tough love,consistency,a little mustache in a certain light. 
And other kids really like her. 
What? 
Hey,fred! 
Well,i think i've seen everything i need to see. 
Man,do i have a headache. 
Let's get down to brass tacks. 
Liz,as a single woman with a demanding job working in such a,well, Nontraditional environment, i'm sorry,but you're not an ideal candidate. 
But we did everything perfectly this time. 
Bev,listen to me. 
Yes,i work very hard. 
Almost all the time. 
But i feel like my life will open up and make room, Just the same way that my heart will open up and make room when i meet this baby. 
And,yes,this place is not ideal,but these weirdoes are family to me. 
And so if this job is a deal-breaker, Then you tear up my application and i will start over someplace else. 
I wish there were a box on these forms where i could check off "passion." 
Because that is exactly the kind of warmth and assertiveness that we are looking for. 
I am going to reconsider your recommendation. 
Oh,bev,thank you! 
Rock thank you,bev! 
I'm bev. 
I'm here to do liz's adoption evaluation. 
Gargh! 
All right,take her to the hospital. 
Let's get started. 
What are you doing?Get upstairs. 
Jonathan,not now. 
Yes now!Jack kicked 
me out of the office. 
He's about to debase himself to save the company. 
Don't do this!If you do,you'll 
be just as bad as devin. 
Liz,what are you doing here? 
I thought you were at the fitness center with your twin. 
What? 
Liz,it's not what you think. 
Kathy and i are just working together. 
Kathy,you know my lover,liz. 
That better be true,jack,or i'll make both of you disappr, Just like i did with vivienne and patch. 
Don't be ridiculous,liz. 
You know you're the only woman i've ever really loved. 
Kathy's my partner. 
She's hiring me to advise her in all her business matters. 
Isn't that true,kathy? 
I'm sorry,darling. 
I've just been paranoid ever since that incident with the weather machine. 
Kiss!Kiss!Kiss! 
No,that's No,i don't think so. 
No thank you. 
Got any mail for me,donaghy? 
It's all over,banks. 
Kathy has hired me privately to advise her on all business matters. 
My god.That's her signature. 
Yeah. 
Well,i'm t stupid,jack. 
I saw this day coming. 
But i've already made provisions for my financial future. 
Check this out. 
I'm gonna sue you! 
I've gonna sue the entire city of new york! 
I'm gonna sue you. 
You can't sue me! 
I'm already being sued! 
Double indemnity! 
No,no,no! 
Lemon,h's your friend bev? 
Unfortunately,bev has made a full recovery. 
So i have to start over with another agency. 
This might take a long time,actually. 
The semi-virtuous path. 
You won't regret it. 
Did you need something else,lemon? 
No. 
I just like seeing you in there.

merry almost christmas, everybody. 
i have some great news.we are all getting 
 frozen steaks. 
 ipod nothings? 
 colorful sweaters? 
 nope,better. 
we are getting to participate in a charity program called "letters to santa." 
no,this is great. 
the post office collects letters that poor kids write to santa, and then we go and buy them wha look,we already did our christmas charity work. 
everybody here chipped in to get sue a bra. 
 that's much better. 
 sweet! 
come on,nobody but me is gonna do this? 
well,i,for one, think it's a great idea, because christmas is a time of giving. 
are you drunk? 
on the spirit of christmas. 
it's this cheap, high-proof brandy i found. 
i hope it's not seasonal. 
i'll take one, ms. lemon. 
i love helping people less fortute than me. 
where do you find them? 
there are these nigerians on the internet that help me. 
listen to this: "dear santa, my name is chanel jenkins. 
"i would like some new shoes "so i can walk to school. 
my dream is to be a doctor some day-- " that kid's never gonna be a doctor. 
better buy it a jet ski. 
 this is what the holidays are all about. 
 okay. 
merry christmas, everyone. 
hello? 
i'm ee,lemon. 
where are you? i hear sunshine. 
i ducked down to florida for a surprise early christmas. 
i showed up three days early, showered my mom with gifts. 
she called them all "adequate." 
it's a christmas miracle. 
well,i'm glad to hear it went well. tell colleen i said hi. 
i wish i could,but she's out for her morning walk. 
ani'm off to have a real christmas.

well,have a good flight. 
i could fly there without a plane.

30 Rock Season03 Episode06 Christmas Special hey,toofer, can i buy a kid fubu? is that a swear wo? 
okay,while fubu is not itself profane,  i do think that-- - thank you. 
lemon. 
what are you doing here? 
why aren't you in rio? 
i hit her. colleen. 
i hit her with my car. 
what? oh,my 
god.is she 
she's fine. she's better than fine. 
they're giving her a titanium hip. like the terminator. 
it's only gonna make her more powerful. 
well,are you okay? 
how can i be? she's 
here,now, in my home. 
some quack doctor strongly recommended she be around faly. 
oh-ho-ho,and colleen didn't miss that one. 
yes,mother? 
well, why don't you try taking one of the many blankets off you if you're feeling hot? 
yes,i know. it is hard. life is hard. 
no,i wasn't. i was 
just scratching my head. 
if you need something, just call down to the doorman. 
yes,he does speak english,mother. 
jamaican people speak eng she hung up. 
i had to cancel my trip, there's nothing going on at work, everyone i know is away for the holidays. 
it's just me and colleen,all alone. lemon... 
one of her suitcases was just wigs. 
look,i'm not doing my usual thing either this year. 
do you want me to come by later, and say hi to your mom? 
would you please? 
yeah,sure. i'll entertain her. 
you know,i was just thinking in the shower this morning, what if saint nick was nic cage? 
'cause it might go a little something like this toofer!toofer,my man. how's tricks? 
ho ho ho! 
no,that sounds more like joan rivers. 
hey,are you almost done? we 
need to get out of here... 
before someone recognizes me. 
yeah,yeah,yeah,i just have to get stocking stuffers. and stockings. 
wait,what is all of this? 
you have video games in here. 
and sports equipment. a tv? 
well,i just want to make sure that deshante,age nine, and marcus,age five, have a wonderful christmas. 
are you really gonna wrap all of these presents? 
of course i'm gonna wrap them, because that's what you do on christmas. 
what you don't do is call your daughter on december 22, and tell her that you don't really feel up to hosting christmas this year, because she's 38, and you thought that she'd have "her own family by now." 
and that instead, you're going to a couples-only retreat in arizona, the theme of which is "sexy at 70." 
oh,no. 
liz,you've never missed christmas with your family. 
i know. 
but i have a new family, the glovers. 
and i am gonna get them all these rapping santas. 
oh,well,i kind of assumed they would rap, which is racist on my part. 
but still, best christmas ever. you're welcome,glovers. 
mother,what is so urgent that you could not wait until i came back from the front door? 
i need my other bell. 
we agreed, one by the bed, and one by the toilet. 
hello. 
oh,liz. 
hello there. 
so good of you to come see me. 
merry christmas, mrs. donaghy. 
oh,liz, i'm so glad you're here. 
i want you to know, and believe, that what happened to me in florida was an accident. 
my son jackie did not run me over on purpose. 
case closed. 
and i don't want to hear another word about it. 
mother,of course it was an accident. 
no one is saying otrwise. 
the real tragedy is that the accident broke,of course, the cartier watch that jackie gave me early this year for christmas. 
ho,ho,ho. 
it's not cartier. it's chopard. 
yes,of course. chopard. 
not the cartier watch, that i wanted. 
uh,liz,uh,could i speak with you for a second,please? 
i can't do this. 
i know,it's stressful. the 
holidays are always stressful. 
it's not just that. 
well,your mother's hurt,and you love her. 
do i? do i,lemon? 
 i waited eight minutes. 
 what after i hit her, before i called 911, i sat in my car for eight minutes. 
what kind of son does that to his mother? 
jack,you were in shock. 
you froze. it happens. 
it was a it was an accident,right? 
what are you two girls whispering about? 
what are you all still do lutz looked it up, and if we stay until noon, it counts as a work week. 
and nbc has to pay for our cabs to the airport. 
tracey,you made $300 million this year. 
and i'm not going anywhere for christmas. 
miss lemon, you really outdid yourself. 
those are gonna be the happiest poor kids since my brother and i went to neverland ranch. 
she went overboard because her family is not exchanging gifts this year. 
holy buddha, who likes christmas? 
it's gonna cost you a fortune to ship all of this. 
oh,no,i'm taking it up there personally. 
i wanna see deshante and marcus's faces light up when they get it. 
anyway, i gotta take this up to 245th street and lawrence taylor boulevard. 
no,no,no,no,no, no,no,no,no,no,no. 
i will not let you go into that neighbo  in the spirit of christmas and kwanzo. 
 kwanzaa. 
and shalam-shizzam to you too,my sister. 
we'll go with you uptown. 
and remember, dotcom, you are there to protect me, and not liz lemon. 
guys,we are out of here in 5,4...3,2 
exciting news,everyone. 
we are going to put on a live christmas eve special this year. 
this year, as in "tomorrow," this year? 
yes,that's right. 
sadly,it will mean working a lot of hours over the next couple of ys, being away from our loved ones. our mothers. 
but we will be part of giving america the perfect christmas eve. 
it's going to be so worth it. now,brainstorming session. 
go! 
i don't want to do this. 
mr. donaghy,as leader of this 
group, i have to put my foot down. 
christmas is a sacred time for me and my surrogate family. 
so if you are willing to look four 25-year-old gay guys in the eyes and tell them that we're not going to see new kids on the block at the borgata,be my guest. 
you are all contractually obligated to participate. 
yes,sir. i never liked 
that group. sorry. 
jack,this isn't fair. 
don't take your mommy issues out on us. 
i'm sorry,lemon, i'm just trying to get through christmas. 
and then what? 
i found a nursing home off the coast of maine run by the same french company that oversaw napoleon's exile. 
she will be treated humanely, but there will be no escape. 
merry christmas. 
thank you so much for carrying that. 
i will buy you guys dinner later. 
liz,we both have girlfriends. 
this is it. 4d. 
tracey,i am gonna need you to take a picture. 
you just push the little button on top. 
thanks a lot. i never 
operated a camera before. 
i'm serious. th was very helpful. 
oh,okay. make sure you get the hug. 
oh,hi. 
i brought these presents as part of the letters to santa program. 
what just happened? 
what's the past tense for "scam?" 
is it "scrumped?" 
liz lemon,i think you just got scrumped. 
donaghy wants a santa costume and a mrs. claus. 
1,2,3,4,5. 
jingle bell all the way in a one-horse open sleigh no. alfonso,i'm on the 
six, you're on the four. 
come on, 1,2,3,4,5. 
ah,my little elves at work. 
looking good,gang. looking good. 
you do realize we're going into quadruple overtime. 
so what? 
we're giving america the perfect christmas,pete. 
there are some kids out there who never get that. 
i know i didn't. 
not with colleen around. 
my dad was long gone. 
so every christmas, colleen would bring her friend mr. schwartz over for dinner, 
and she's make me play songs on the piano, and she would sing to him. 
my parents divorced when i was nine and every year, the dreadful moment arrived, when i would catch mr. schwartz 
caressing my mother's bony thigh. 
and i'd say "eyes on the keys,jackie boy, keep your eyes on the keys." 
and they'd ask me to playwhite christmas, and it would turn into some boozy burlesque travesty. 
every time i hear that song, i get aroused. 
what is wrong with me? 
i have to... go to the prop meeting now. 
she's the reason. she's why it happened. 
so the overtime? 
approved,yeah. 
it's christmas. 
 next. 
 yes,finally. 
hi,i would like to speak to whoever screens the letters to santa. 
then you better talk to that box. 
uh,maybe you could help me,trene. 
 irene. 
 irene. 
i believe that i was the victim of a scam ock perpetrated through the mails, so there's nothing we can do about that. 
i disagree. i think there are 
a lot of things we could do. 
i would like to access any census information you have for this address. 
no. 
in addition,i would like to speak to the letter carrier... 
you know we're closing in five minutes,right? 
 who services zipplusfour. 
 never gonna happen. 
can you help me out with her? 
oh,really? 
we're both black, so we must know each other? 
 hey,irene! 
 hey,tracey. 
 did vicky hook you up with this job? 
 yeah. 
girl,you better stop. 
hey,you don't know the postmaster i do,but we had a falling out over the jerry garcia stamp. 
i mean,if i want to lick a hippie, i would just return joan baez's phone calls. 
are you wearing the same clothes as yesterday? 
i have no choice. i can't go home. 
oh,come on. you can go home. 
no,i n't. last night, 
we had... an incident. 
jackie,sweetheart. 
can you get this heavy wool blanket out from underneath me? 
i'm sweating like a grape picker. 
come on, put me back into it... jacqueline. 
my other hip! 
i think it was subconscious. 
i've had enough. 
50 years of criticism and feelings of inadequacy. 
50 ruined christmases. 
i want to be free. 
what are you saying? 
i can't be alone with her. 
you see,lemon, my mother is like a virus, and my body is trying to get rid of her. 
good god,she can't know i'm having these thoughts. 
she can't know about the eight minutes. 
if she knew, she would have me arrested. she's done it before. 
hey,the candy canes are for the show. 
oh,so how'd it go uptown,ms. lemon? 
i'll tell you how it went. 
i filed a report with the better business bureau. 
i'm not gonna rest until the letters to santa program is shut down. 
what is wrong with you? 
you are being a real scrooge. 
it was just two dudes,kenneth. 
they scammed me,and now they're selling that stuff on ebay. 
k there were no kids up there, and there definitely weren't any hugs around here. 
well,if all you want is a hug from a black person... 
maybe you should just hostthe price is right. 
i don't believe people would do that, ms. lemon. 
this is a religious holiday. 
when has religion ever caused any trouble? 
kenneth,you're naive. 
and you're acting like a real c-word right now. 
that's right, a cranky sue. 
i know in my heart that children got those presents. 
they didn't,kenneth. i'll prove 
it to you. it's dinner break. 
trac, we're going uptown. 
all right, i'll call grizz and dotcom. 
i'm sure they're not doing anything. 
no. doctor williams said "boundaries." 
mother,you shouldn't be exerting yourself like that. 
i'm sorry that work has kept me from... 
spending more time with you. 
what kind of time,jackie? 
eight minutes,maybe? 
john francis donaghy. 
how could you? how could you? 
waiting eight minutes to call 911. 
i can't believe it. 
i don't know what you're talking about,mother. 
i've got to get back to work now. 
exhibit a! 
your cell phone bi you made a call to 911 at 8:16 a.m. 
exhibit b. the watch that 
my son gave me for christmas. 
not the one i wanted, by the way. 
you had just set it before it broke,of course, when your car rammed into me down in florida. 
and it stopped at 8:08. 
exhibit c. 16 minus eight is eight. 
numbers, unlike children, don't lie. what kind of son 
what kind of mother tes her son that john kennedy died because he talked in church? 
or tells her son when he was voted caption of the diving team, "what a great way to meet guys." 
or invite strange men over on christmas eve! 
don't turn this around,jackie! 
don't make this about me! 
it's always about you. 
i am 50 years old. 
you have ruined every christmas i've ever had, and i'm not letting you take this one down too. 
you're walking away from me! 
more snow machines! 
see,kenneth, those drawings are a clue that children live here. 
or basquiat. 
and this bare door is a scam door. 
no,children live here. i know it. 
get ready to have your little bubble burst. 
come on,christmas. come on,christmas. 
hello? 
oh,my gosh. are you deshante and marcus? 
and you got the presents? there 
are presents under the tree? 
i did that. i got that stuff for you. 
i'm the one who made christmas happen. 
what about santa? 
daddy,she said there's no santa claus. 
what is wrong with you? 
no,i'm-- i did a good thing.i got a letter from 
yeah,the letter that said "dear santa," not "dear lonely white lady." 
i'm sorry. 
could i offer you tickets to a live christmas special in the tradition of andy williams? 
okay,you were right. 
so yeah,you were right. 
 do you know your mother is here? 
 i don't care. 
i'm trying to produce a christmas special that makes it's a wonderful life look likepulp fiction. 
where the hell is mrs. claus? 
you can't do christmas eve without her. 
what is wrong with you people? 
we're on in 30 seconds. 
how couldn't you have mrs. claus? 
i didn't realize you were serious about that,so i cut it. 
you can't cut mrs. claus. 
everyone knows that on christmas eve, mrs.claus hangs your stockings, 
then puts out food for santa. 
then you sings songs around the piano until she tucks you in. 
did your mother not do tt? 
that's not a thing,jack. 
yes,it is. no. 
mrs.claus must have been 
something special that colleen did. 
probably to make up for the fact that your dad wasn't around. 
no,christmas in the donaghy house was awful. 
have i not told you about my mom's yuletide boyfriend? 
good old frederick august otto schwartz e third? 
f.a.o.schwartz? like the toy store? 
his family owned some toy stores,yes. so what? 
jack,i think your mother put out on christmas to get you kids presents. 
she did it for you. 
not possible. she didn't 
do anything for us. 
well,i know you guys were pretty poor. 
did you have a lot of presents? 
you couldn't even see the tree. 
in 5,4,3... 
our first guest has sung with everyone from paul anka to crocodile dundee. 
cross to piano. 
ladies and gentlemen, jenna maroney! 
* chestnuts roasting on an open fire * * jack frost nipping ayour nose * * yuletide carols being sung by the choir * * and folks dressed up like eskimos * * everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe * liz lemon, i know you're gonna be all alone on christmas day. 
so if you like, you can spend it with the jordans. 
i'd love to,tracey. 
good,we'll be over at 2:00. 
my kids have a peanut allergy, but dogs only eat steak. 
okay. 
* they know that santa's on his way...* 
what on earth is the matter with you? 
i love you,mother, and i don't want you to die. 
i'm never going to,jackie. 
miss lemon, You have several messages. 
Let's see, that company running the bike tour In south carolina says,  "no singles." 
 Okay. 
your credit card called. 
They wanna make sure you're the one Buying cream soda in bulk. 
I sure am. 
And your landlord called. 
And he said it is not the toilet, it's you. 
That's his opinion. 
and jean From your high school reunion committee called. 
They want to know if you're coming this weekend. 
No. No way. 
Oh, you have to go. 
My high school reunion was so much fun. 
Hey there, michael. 
Oh, my god, phil barror. 
Hello, teniqua. 
You gotta go to your reunion. 
You get to get back at everybody Who ever messed with you. 
You said i'd never amount to anything! 
Look at me now! 
Look at this necklace! 
Sir, this is a school for deaf girls. 
And i definitely would have gone to my reunion. 
But the boat i was educated on sank. 
Well, i wouldn't have fun, so i'm not going. 
Kathy... 
over here. 
Kathy. 
We shouldn't have to go through this, sir. 
You are doing the job of the ceo. 
It should be you On the cover of the quarterly report. 
It will be. 
If kathy's father ever comes out of his coma. 
Until then, the board has put her in charge, And we need to respect that. 
What if something happened to her? 
Something bad! 
Then we would have a secret that bound us together. 
What is she doing? 
I don't know. 
Either a weather event is approaching, Or... 
Get me jack donaghy. 
Capture:FRM@�ķ� 30 rock S03 ep05 How come there ain't no puerto ricans on star trek?! 
They got every race and life-Form in the galaxy, Except for puerto ricans. 
What's up with that? 
What is this, the local? 
He woke up! 
Geiss woke up. 
What?! 
??Yes! 
What's that flavor? 
It's dove age-Fighting acne cream. 
Geiss is awake? 
 You're gonna be ceo. 
 Yes! 
I was the first person he called. 
Well, his french-Canadian mistress, and then me. 
I'm meeting him in one hour on the edison terrace. 
I did it, lemon. 
I got the brass ring. 
And i couldn't have done it without... 
my lucky coin. 
Well... I'm happy for you. 
You're having your reunion this weekend? 
I wish i had a princeton reunion right now. 
Wipe that smug smile off michelle obama's face. 
Am i the only person around here That doesn't like reunions? 
Don't tell me you're not gonna go. 
This may come as some surprise to you, jack, But i was kind of a lonely nerd in high school. 
And if i remember correctly, You were a good deal more... 
Yeah, it was hell for me. 
I just wanted to be left alone, But i guess every high school has people like kelsey winthrop. 
Hey, liz, how's the telescope? 
?? 
Ugh, the only people that are gonna go to this thing Are people like her and her stupid friends. 
The cool, pretty crowd. 
Well, that's you now, lemon. 
You run a hit tv show, You have very impressive friends. 
You found a hairstyle that works for you, So long as it's not too humid. 
And you're telling me that you don't have the confidence To face a bunch of whittling, jug-Blowing, Ihop monkeys? 
Jack, it's a suburb of philadelphia. 
Lemon, you will go and show that kelsey winthrop That the ugly duckling has turned into A vaguely ethnic swan. 
No, i'm not going. I'd never 
get a rental car now anyway. 
Well, then, take the ge jet. 
The ceo insists. 
They have popcorn on the plane. 
I want to go to there. 
Mr. Geiss, it is very good 
to see you Up and about, sir. 
Yes, jackie boy, I think you know why you're here. 
Congratulations. 
You are the first to know, officially, That i'm staying on as ceo. 
I'm sorry, what did you say? 
A beam of energy came and spoke to me During my coma. 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 I don't know what it was. 
It could have been an alien. 
Maybe it was god. 
Maybe it was an unborn aztec king. 
But it told me my work here is not yet done. 
Oh, it's done. I think it's done. 
You're still my choice to take over when i die, If that ever even happens. 
Tray, why are you in your angry chair? 
Because kenneth got a bigger laugh In the elevator than me today. 
And where were you two?! 
Your job is to protect me from embarrassment. 
 Grizz had to go to the optometrist. 
 Making up words won't save you. 
Okay, we're getting on the elevator with kenneth, And you're going to laugh at my jokes. 
Hey, hey. 
I'm so glad i found you. 
There's been a change of plans. 
Geiss is staying on as ceo. 
 What?! 
 A beam of energy told him to. 
That's fun, right? 
And instead of running everything, I'm going back to my old job. 
So the standards department is telling me You can only say "cat anus" twice During the show, but i'm gonna fight for you. 
You can say it three times. 
Cat anus, cat anus, cat anus! 
 Are you okay? 
 I have to be. 
What are my other options? 
Cry? Wallow? 
If i do that, Geiss and the beam win. 
If i control my feelings, i win. 
Jeez, jack, tough year. 
First william f. Buckley dies, now this. 
Next stop impotence, right? 
So since we don't have the jet, i guess No, no, you're still going to your reunion. 
Nothing changes, i rented a jet, And i'll drop you off on my way to miami. 
Why are you going to miami? 
Why does anybody go to miami? 
Ass and the burgeoning art scene. 
I gotta blow off some steam. 
Come on, let's go have some fun. 
I'm sorry you're stuck in white haven. 
Boy, it was something landing in this storm, huh? 
Listen, about some of the stuff that i said... 
One time i laughed at a blind guy eating spaghetti! 
Sometimes i pee in the shower if i'm really tired! 
I saw my grandparents making love once, And i didn't leave right away! 
He didn't give it to me. 
All that work, all that sacrifice. 
Why did i bother? 
I know, but remember, don't let him win. 
 Cat anus. 
 I don't know who i am. 
 Jack... 
 i don't know where i am. 
I know it's not miami, But you can blow off steam here. 
We have a lovely n.C. Wyeth museum. 
Actually, some meth addicts burned that place down Last august. 
Well, there are excellent restaurants Down on cabot street. 
the vietnamese immigrants took over All of those places. 
I wouldn't recommend going to little hanoi after dark Unless you're wearing a khan dong. 
Why don't you just direct me To the bar? 
I'm sorry, sir, no bars here. 
We've been a dry county since 1880. 
It's the one tradition that remains. 
But do you like methodist churches Full of vietnamese? 
Give me the key. 
Hey, elevator, what's this? 
A ghetto mating call. 
i didn't get the memo. 
Jeesh, buy a guy a drink first. 
This place is bigger than my apartment. 
A manhattan, please. 
Sure. What kind of bourbon? 
??Ne spritzer, please. 
Kelsey winthrop. 
I think danvers has a bar. 
To get there, you just go Straight down ngo dinh diem boulevard Until you see a sign that says "detour." 
Now ignore that. It's a trap. 
And then you want to get on route nine going west About 30 miles. 
Does the reunion have a bar? 
Kelsey? It's liz lemon. 
 Oh, my god! 
 Yeah. Surprising. 
But cocoon, and then flap, flap, flap--Butterfly. 
i did not think you'd come. 
Well, i almost didn't. 
I was in manhattan, working in the fast lane You made life a living hell for everyone here! 
You would have to come to the reunion And make us go through it all again. 
 What? 
 You know, i tried to befriend you Just so you'd leave me alone. 
Hey, liz, how's the telescope? 
I don't know, kelsey. 
How's your mom's pill addiction? 
What are you talking about? 
I was a nerd. 
You were a bully! 
We were all afraid of you. 
We called you the white haven witch. 
 Lemon?! 
 Oh, erin, no! 
Don't sink to her level. 
This is a beauty mark. 
But you thought it was funny to say that god pooped on me. 
I didn't think anybody was listening to me. 
I was a nobody. 
You were homecoming queen. 
I have had years of therapy Kel--Kels, Your facial tic. 
You brought it back! 
You happy? 
And i still got the mulch business. 
It's hard work, but i'm outside all day, And i don't answer to anyone. 
Excuse me,  can i ask you a question? 
 Sure. 
Are you happy? 
Well, i got a boat, good friends, and a trampoline. 
You tell me. 
That's the life, right? 
What are you doing here? 
I'm getting drunk. 
Lemon, would you buy my mulch? 
I don't know, jack. 
I just found out that i was a jerk In high school. 
Yeah, turns out i'm not the lovable nerd. I was the bully you hate. 
This is mostly spit. 
Hello, elizabeth. 
It's rob sussman. 
Still think i am "gayer than the volleyball scene In top gun"? 
No, we-- We were friends. 
No, i just said that stuff To try to make it okay for you to come out. 
Come out of what?! 
I'd like you to meet my wife, With whom i've raised three beautiful dogs. 
 Oh, boy. 
 I cannot deal right now. 
I'm so mad, all i can do is dance. 
even rob sussman hated me? 
He was the first gay guy i ever kissed. 
What is wrong with these people? 
Nothing. They're good americans. 
Hey, lemon, check this out. 
I just made it up. 
??Beers, boats, and buds. 
Doesn't that sound great? 
 Are you having a stroke? 
 No. 
No, all my life i thought i made good choices, But am i happy? 
These people are happy. I envy them. 
I wish i was one of them. 
Larry? 
Larry braverman? 
Yes. 
I am larry braverman. 
Larry braverman. 
No one has seen you Since what...graduation. 
Man, you are still, like, the coolest guy ever. 
Hey, you still got that old camaro? 
No, no, it finally broke down. 
 Oh, man... 
 Yeah, from having too much sex in it!

That's awesome. 
Hey, let's go out in the parking lot And do donuts! 
You know, just like in the old days. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Let's do it. Come on. 
Come on. 
Let's do some donuts. 
How is this working? You are 12 years 
older than everybody here. 
Lemon, rich 50 is middle-Class 38, okay? 
Jack... 
no, no, i don't want to be jack donaghy anymore. 
I'm larry now. That's one thing that 
don geiss can't take away from me. 
Now, are you gonna be leaving soon? 
'Cause you're kinda harshin' everybody's buzz Around here. 
No, i'm not gonna leave. 
Sure, i said some dumb things in high school, But i have changed. 
I'm gonna turn this thing around, jack. 
Show everybody the good, kind person i've become. 
Go home, lemon! 
No way, new friend. 
Jenna, we're the most important people here, right? 
Well, of course, tracy. We're actors. 
If we didn't exist, how would people know who to vote for? 
And people around here shouldn't take attention From us, should they? 
No. Never. 
Attention is what gives us power. 
If someone threatens that, you have to put a stop to it. 
Wait, who are you worried about? 
Is it allison from wardrobe's baby? 
What is up with that thing? 
So she can put her feet in her mouth. So can i. 
It's not the baby. It's kenneth. 
Kenneth?! 
Are you crazy? 
Come on. He knows his place. 
 And he worships us. 
 Yeah... He does. 
Come on, you know we're the big dogs around here. 
Hey, let's go throw a tantrum about the air-Conditioning. 
That sounds really nice. 
Lemon! 
Larry? 
Larry... 
It's me, jessica. 
I can't believe you're here. 
You never answered my letters. 
I--I didn't know what to say... 
Because of, you know... 
 The things. 
 I hate the way we ended, larry. 
I am so, so sorry for what happened. 
I forgive you... 
jessica. 
Really? 
 Even for  Especially for that. 
Say what you said to me that night at the lake. 
No. 
Guys? 
I just want to say i'm so, so sorry If i ever made you Really, liz? 20 years 
too late and way too little. 
Ooh, hello. 
Would you please leave us alone. 
'Cause you know what, We're trying to have fun tonight. 
That's my point. I've changed. 
New liz is fun. 
I don't ruin parties. I get 'em going. 
Look, let's all do the diane. 
What is wrong with you?! 
Diane? 
Hi. 
Could you hit four, please? 
Next stop, kansas city. 
you are so funny. 
They should put you on the show. 
* did you ever know that you're my hero * * and everything i would like to be-E-E * Singing in the elevator. 
It's like a road trip to the sky! 
* 99 bottles of beer on the wall * * 99 bottles of beer * * you take one down, pass it around * * 98 bottles of beer on the wall * Kenneth is a monster! 
We have to stop him! 
I want you all to know how happy i am right now. 
Being here with you people has helped me more Than you can know. 
To us! 
Oh, man, look at us! 
It's just like we're back in high school, right? 
You know what was always my favorite thing? 
Seven minutes in heaven. 
You always got the bottle to land on me. 
Think you still have the touch? 
Oh, yeah. 
Do it! Come on! 
Come on, braverman! 
Do it, do it, do it... 
What are we all doing? 
Boo! 
Just to be clear, we're not making out. 
That would be social suicide. 
Like i even want to be here in this closet at this reunion. 
 It's a nightmare. 
 A nightmare for whom, lemon? 
If these jagweeds don't want to get to know the nice new me, Then screw them and their rapidly yellowing teeth. 
lemon, you really haven't changed, have you? 
Excuse me? 
What happened when i told you geiss had screwed me over For the ceo job? 
Did you offer your help as a friend? 
Or did you make some joke about me being impotent? 
Jeez, that was, like, eight hours ago. 
I was just, i don't know, cutting the tension. 
Or, as always, were you hiding behind your sense of humor Instead of engaging in a real way? 
Really, i'm the one that's hiding, larry braverman? 
There it is, right there. 
When you feel threatened, you attack. 
That's why you're almost 40 and you're still alone. 
At least i'm not 50, alone, And sitting on 2,000 business cards For a job i'm never gonna get. 
 What did you say? 
 Yeah. 
Your bags were delivered to my room by accident. 
Look what i found. 
You went to a printer, didn't you? 
You picked out a font. 
You paid extra for a rush order. 
It was your happy, little secret. 
What are you doing? 
Why is she so mean? 
What'd you do to braverman?! 
 She's awful. 
 She's the gay one! 
Here's your lunch, mr. Parcell. 
Just the way you like it. 
Ham sandwich with the works, hold the bread. 
But that's my job. 
This studio hosted The kraft television theater in the 1950s, Where young writers like paddy chayefsky and rod serling First rose to prominence. 
Mr. Jordan, why are you giving a tour? 
It doesn't feel good when someone does your job, does it? 
I don't understand. 
I don't like it when you do jokes in the elevator. That's my job. 
Oh, lord, i didn't know. 
I would never do anything to hurt you. 
You're my best friend. 
We're not really best friends. 
We're just good friends. 
I just want you to stop. 
I will. I will. 
i'm so sorry, miss morone. 
No, keep crying. 
I want you to feel this So you never make this mistake again. 
And for traveling the farthest distance, It's david messinger! 
Hey, larry, We've got this plan to get back at liz, And we wanna know if you're in  We're gonna carrie her. 
 Like the movie. 
It will be delicious. 
And now, for best school spirit, It's liz lemon! 
Come up on stage, liz! 
no, thanks. I don't want it. 
It comes with a $50 gift certificate To * outback steak house * I want to go to there. 
Wait... 
Wait! 
Wait, we cannot do this. 
We cannot carrie liz lemon. 
Oh, not okay, guys! 
We all know That liz lemon has her faults, But no one's perfect. 
I mean, i'm certainly not perfect. 
Don't say that, braverman! 
You're more than perfect. 
No, no, no, it's true. 
I've made mistakes. 
Sacrificed happiness for a job I don't think i'm ever going to get. 
We all have ways of coping. 
I use sex and awesomeness. 
Lemon here hides behind her insults, But that's not who she is. 
She's a good person... 
Whom i'm honored to call my friend. 
Thank you, larry. 
And i'm sorry i lashed out at you. 
You will need those cards someday. 
Larry, We're all so happy to have you back in our lives. 
But me especially. 
Because there's someone i want you to meet. 
Larry... 
This is your son. 
I am not larry braverman. 
I repeat, i am not larry braverman! 
I am liz lemon's Platonic friend, jack donaghy. 
Lemon, come on, let's go. 
Once and for all, i want to say i'm sorry. 
You know what, suck it, you whittling ihop monkeys! 
Lemon, the jet's waiting. 
That's right, a jet, to new york city! 
Lemon, out! 
Braverman! 
Oh,good morning, dr. Baird. 
Good morning, regular person lemon.

Okay. Uh,how 'bout... Friday?

 Okay then. 
 Okay. 
Valentine's day it is. 
Saturday is valentine's day? 
Norts! 
You sound so sexy when you say that. 
Say it again. 
Your mother's gone back to florrrida. 
These mcflurries are amazing. 
I know. 
The soft swirl of vanilla, And the hard crunch of candy and cookies. 
You'd think they fight each other, But no,together they are perfecto. 
Some would say that describes us. 
Who would say such a crazy thing? 
We are us. 
Let a mcflurry be what it is The world's greatest dessert. 
Actually,the world's greatest dessert Is served in a restaurant right here in new york Called plunder. 
It costs $1,000. 
Lucky for you,your boyfriend got reservations For valentine's day. 
But I have to go to church. 
On valentine's day? Is that a thing? 
It is the feast of the martyrdom oft. Valentine. 
Please,jack,don't tell me you're one of those Convenient catholics That only goes to church every sunday.

30 Rock Season03 Episode11 Oh,kennet h ey,you know how the company makes an effort To hire the disabled? 
Do i! 
I wouldn't have this job If it weren't for the mouth on my back. 
Yeah,i'm supposed to supervise some blind chick They hired to edit the reruns. 
But three of the dancers just found out They're all dating the same guy, So i'm gonna go watch that. 
So if you see a blind chick, I don't know. 
Um,give her one of yr ring tours. 
Yes,sir. Yes,sir. 
I was just funnin'. It's all sewed up. 
I'll help you,miss. 
Oh,thank you so much. 
All my friends warned me about the big city, But look,right away I meet a gentleman. 
Is everything okay? Because 
now I smell burnt plastic. 
Hello? E you there? 
Hello? 
I can't make this guy go on a first date On valentine's. 
Why are you so nervous about this? 
Because it's a delicate situation,jack. 
There is handsomeness involved. 
How much? 
Oh,come on,lemon. 
 What is this,a green card thing? 
 No. 
 Closet case? 
 I don't think so. 
 Slump buster? 
 No,not a ballplayer. 
Bundy-esque serial killer? 
That wasmyfirst thought, but no. 
This is actually happening, and i'm blowing it. 
Who pushes for a first date on valentine's day? 
Lemon,here's how you correc this misstep. 
Instead of going to a restaurant, Where it'll be nothing but people in love And rings hidden in pastries... 
Cook him a nice meal at home. 
Nice... You mean, like,stew? 
I certainly do not mean stew. 
I mean,try to forget it's valentine's day. 
I'm into. I'll be in church. 
What? Why? 
Elisa is deeply religious. 
If I had those knockers, i'd be thanking god too. 
All I want for valentine's day is to go to plunder And eat the lovers' delight. 
That sounds filthy,jack. 
It is. 
Imagine a dessert for two Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream in a pool ofogc, Drizzled in the world's most expensive chocolate, Amadei porcelana, Covered with shaved white, black,and clear truffles, And topped with edible 25-karat gold leaf. 
Can you imagine anything better? 
I don't know,you ever put a doughnut in the microwave? 
Come on,church won't be so bad. Aren't you catholic? 
I was catholic. 
But I haven't set foot inside a church Since I was 13 years old. 
So listen,so you go sit through a night of church, And then you go to plunder. 
Elisa's worth it. 
You're right. Elisa is worth it. 
And I can fake enthusiasm when I need to. 
Hey,that scarf is fun! 
Thanks. I found it at 
dunkin-- Wait a minute. 
Nbc. Blah blah blah. Thank you. 
Ken,you need to snap out of it And ask out that sexy miss magoo. 
I have no idea what you're talking about. 
I know love at first sight when I see it. 
I saw it when I met angie, I saw it the first time dotcom laid eyes On grizz's fiancee. 
Okay,there is something about jennifer That just makes me all car sick inside. 
Now is the time for gallantry. 
It's you again. I can tell. 
Well,cotton and fiddles! 
I enjoy your smile. 
Oh,my. 
I'm jennifer rogers. 
You may ll me kenneth the page. 
Because that is who I am. 
Would you like to go out with me tomorrow night, Yes-indeedy corncobs? 
Well,i'm gonna say yes. 
Because this just feels right, And my instincts have never let me down. 
Except for looking at that eclipse. 
It's a valentine's datelie-doo! 
That was really good stew. 
Thank you. It's my own recipe, Where 
I use cheddar cheese instead of water. 
You know,i'm glad we stayed in tonight. 
It's good to take things slow. 
Well,please know that when invited you over, I didn't realize it was valentine's day. 
Yeah,you still have that rotting jack-o'- lantern In the hallway, So I feel like you don't have a great sense Of what month it is. 
Well,it's just gotten so small That I kinda want to see if it disappears. 
So,uh,first date stuff. 
Where are you from? 
Well,um,there's a really interesting answer To that question,actually. 
I was born on the border of maryland and pennsylvania. 
Okay,i feel like I should do the right thing here And tell you that Your breast is falling out of your blouse, And I can see all of it. 
Okay,well,i guess we just jumped ahead to date four. 
It's not the good one,either. 
 Jack donaghy's office. 
 Jonathan! 
Our jonathan, who art in the office, Hallowed be my reservation. 
If you are able, hold my table, At plunder, As we will not be there by 7:00. 
Have them delay our heavenly dessert, And forgive us our lateness, As we forgive those who cause lateness against us... 
Well,thank you for explaining that. 
I always wanted to know how a universal remote works. 
Well,that's how idoes. 
Would you excuse me just one second? 
I'll be right back. 
Oh,cheese stew! What was I thinking? 
I think your brownies are burning. 
You want me to take 'em out? 
Yes,please. 
But whatever you do, Don't open that kitchen window... 
 No! 
 Oh,too soon! 
The draft made the door fly open! 
I know. It's not a big deal. 
So we skipped from date four to date... 
No,date never. I would 
never let that happen. 
Liz,it's okay,i'm a doctor. 
 I've seen much worse. 
 Really? 
I'm just kidding. That was pretty bad. 
Hold on. Sorry. I have to get this. 
Hello,mandy. 
Yeah,no,i'm downstairs in 3-b. Why? 
No,mandy,you can't just drop her off without calling. 
Mandy? Is that like a guy 
friend? Like mandy patinkin? 
No,i can't. 
Because I am on a date right now. 
No,mandy, do u Sorry. That was my ex-wife. My 
daughter bethany is on her way up. 
You have a daughter? 
You will see her. You 
will say she's cute. 
But let me just say that she is... Complicated. 
My mother usually watches her when I can't, But my mother has been in the hospital recently, And she's not doing very well. And that has been... 
Hard f me to handle. 
I'm sorry that all this keeps falling apart. 
I was really looking forward to tonight. 
Well,we can try again some other time. 
 Or... 
 I'm listening. 
Maybe tonight is a gift. 
Maybe we embrace the toilet thing, And the bra incident, and my ex-wife, And my daughter, And we just get it all out in one night. 
And if by the end of it we still like each other, Then maybe it's the real thing. 
That would be bethany. 
Well,this is it. The express 
train is leaving the station. 
 I'm on the train. 
 Okay. 
Mom's keying your car. 
Bethany,this is liz. 
 Hi,it's so nice to mee  Why does it smell in here? 
 Cheese stew. 
 I got sick. 
Okay,be nice. 
I will be right back After I go talk to your mother. 
And... Give me your purse. 
Why don't you ever trust me? 
Because,honey,you keep setting fire to things. 
And now a prayer For the pregnant members of our congregation. 
Anita alvarez... 
Anna alvarez... 
Anabel alvarez... 
Honey,this is a catholic church. 
We'll be here until morning. 
All right, you've been good. 
Let's go. 
We just have to go to confession before we leave. 
Benita alveroz. 
Okay,here's how this is gonna go. 
We're gonna sit here in silence For about three minutes, Then i'm going to take my girlfriend to plunder, Where the pope himself could not get a table. 
 You sound troubled,my son. 
 Can it,ther. 
That was a nice try,though. 
That limo ride was weird. 
It felt like we just circled the block 50 times. 
That's how you get to manhattan's fanciest restaurant. 
Ah,monsieur parcell. 
Votre table est pret. 
I didn't know itas french restaurant. 
Yes,i found it on my favorite web site Stopshowingoff.com. 
It's busy tonight. 
It's the best darn-tootenest restaurant In all of new york. 
This is thbe thank you,kenneth. 
You're one in a million. 
Man,can you believe we're working on valentine's night? 
My fiancee's gonna be upset. 
Not to worry. I sent her 
flowers and a beautiful card. 
You're the best. 
Don't you have faith? 
I have faith in things I can see, And buy,anderegulate. 
Capitalism is my religion. Now,you want 
to have an intellectual argument? Fine. 
But I should warn you, I went to princeton. 
I went to harvard divinity school. 
You crimson guys never miss a chance,do you? 
You want a confession? 
Let's get this done so I can go eat. 
I am divorced. 
I take the lord's name in vain often and with great relish. 
I hit my mother with a car, possibly by accident. 
I almost let him choke to death Right there on the football field. 
I looked the other way when my wig-based parent company Turned a bunch of children orange. 
I once claimed, "i am god" during a position. 
And I may have sodomized our former vice president While under the influence of some weapons-grade narcotics. 
It feels good to say that out loud,actually. 
That one was weiinon me. 
Wow,i,uh... 
I don't know what to say. 
I don't want you to say anything. 
I already made that clear. 
Then what... Brought you here tonight? 
What brought me here? 
What brings anyone anywhere? 
Why do men build bridges? 
Why are there jets? 
I was hoping to have sex tonight. 
Have you ever made love to a woman,father? 
Come on,man. 
Imagine cradling your face into the curve Of a velvety-soft neck. 
Your hands cupping the warm heft Of the greatest pair of... 
I need backup! Harvard 
did not preparme for this. 
Father? 
I like your bracelets. 
Girls at my school get them For doing different things on the bus. 
Blue is for showing your boobs. 
Purple's for doing stuff over your clothes. 
 Black is for doing stuff-- - okay,uh... 
Your mom left. How are 
you two getting along? 
She had some more stew while you were outside. 
 Wow,liz, did u kill the whole bottle? 
 What? 
Sorry... Hello. 
Yes,gloria. Why are you crying? 
Gloria? How many ex-wives does he have? 
That's my aunt. She'snotgonna like you. 
No,of course. I'll be 
there as soon as I can. 
Yeah. Good-bye. 
Mom has taken a turn. 
Oh,i'm so sorry. 
Look,i know we said that we would take this In fast motion tonight, but... 
No,no,i know. 
I really am glad we did, Because I don't think I could handle this by myself. 
Okay. 
What? Liz knew. 
Entertainment? 
Not just any entertainment. 
The best singer in the world-- Michael mcdonald. 
Wow,he does not sound good live. 
********** ***** ******** *********** ***** ********* ****** ********** Okay,in english. In english. 
You tortured that poor priest. 
Let me ask you somhing. 
Do you even believe in the teachings Of the catholic church? 
No. 
But I saw your photo with the pope. 
That's just good business. I 
have photos with a lot of people. 
The dalai lama,rabbi yosef, Toby keith. 
I see. 
You have no faith, only business. 
You kn wt your problem is,jack? 
You intellectualize everything with your big head. 
Well,you have big boobs! 
Which you'll never touch again! 
This conversation has taken an unfortunate turn. 
Maybe this is god trying to tell me That we do not belong together. 
Maybe this is a sign. 
Look,my driver just pulled up. That's a sign. 
God wants us to leave here, get a good meal, And go to town on each other. 
How dare you say something like that So close to the statue of santa lucia, The patron saint of judgmental statues? 
Go to your stupid restaurant. 
Eat your gold ice cream. 
Please come with me. 
No. You blew it,jack. 
And now you will never see the crazy underwears I have on! 
Elisa! 
What kind of god would let that happen? 
Oh,drew,finally. 
 Who's this? 
 This is liz. This is our first date. 
On valentine's day? 
Funny story.He saw 
me on the toilet liz? 
Dr. Baird,your mother's asked 
to speak to you... Privately. 
I'm sorry. 
Is this,like, asixth sensething? 
Should I bring a place setting for your friend? 
 Mom... 
 Who is that? 
That's my friend liz. 
Hi,mrs. Baird. 
It's too soon,andrew. 
I know. We tried to take it slow... 
Life! 
I have more I want to do. 
Oh,right,you. Of course. 
I'm gonna grab her chart. I'll be right back. 
Mandy,you look terrible. 
Oh,,i'm not mandy. I'm liz. 
Mandy,you have to tell drew something for me. 
The woman he thinks is his sister Is really his mother. 
What? 
I'm his grandmother. 
You have to tell him, or I won't get into heaven. 
Thank you for a truly unbelievable evening. 
It doesn't have to end here,y'allsies. 
Wait. This isn't right. 
Kenneth,why do you suddenly sound white? 
I lied to you,jennifer. 
I was too scared to talk to you, So my sophisticated friend tracy Said the things that I couldn't. 
I'm very,very sorry. 
Well,if you could've talked to me, Whatould you have said? 
That you're the sweetest, prettiest, Blindest girl i've ever met. 
And when i'm with you, my heart jumps Like a frog on july asphalt, right before it dies. 
You're so beautiful on the inside,kenneth parcell. 
Can I feel your face? 
Yeah. 
Oh,look at the time. I 
forgot,i have a-- a thing. 
That is cold, blind lady! 
Oh,and by the way, You're not so attractive yourself! 
No,i'm-- i'm pretty sure i'm hot. 
Yes,you are. I tried. 
****** I'm so sorry. 
Listen, thank you so much For being so great during all this. 
Let's do this again sometime. 
Except have it not be anything like this at all. 
Yeah. 
 Good night. 
 Good night. 
Uh,liz,you my mom did just die. 
Funny story... Hear me out. 
I'll have a,uh... 
 A mcflurry,please. 
 A mcflurry,please. 
And I have a coupon. You 
know where I found it? 
In the collection plate. 
It was a sign. 
I followed it,and it brought us back together. 
Now do you believe? 
I believe. 
I believe that we were reunited By the most successful capitalist enterprise Of the last hundred years, Despite the mclean deluxe, or the mcemu. 
Whatever. 
Someone's trying to tell us that we belong together. 
 Maybe it's god. 
 Maybe it's ray kroc. 
Maybe it's the hamburglar. 
Happy valentine's day, querida. 
Happysaintvalentine's day, mi amor. 
Boy,he that guy's not planning To kill her and eat her. 
Jack,you're such a romantic. 
Are you sure you don't wanna go to a real restaurant? 
No, this food car is great! 
Look at this guy, used to be a man once. 
What is that supposed to mean? 
Don't you want what he has some day? 
Family, wife, children. 
Lemon, you're a woman. 
Of course I am! 
That doctor was a quack, I don't even know why my parents listened to him. 
I need advice. Elisa is coming by 
this afternoon to, uh,  talk about us. 
 Ach, ladies are such a bummer. 
Where is this going, how serious are we, why don't you listen to my story about my friend? 
Well, where is it going? Ladies like 
to know what that next step is, they we can't help ourselves. 
Oh, believe me Lemon, I want to take that next step. 
 You mean, like, marriage? 
 No, the one before that. 
 Moving in together? 
That's huge! - No, 
the thing you do before that. 
 think "you in the midnineties." 
 You haven't had sex? 
Elisa had a very strict, very religious upbringing. 
She does not take that step lightly. 
We have, of course,  pleasured one another  No, stop, I believe. 
But she wants me to make some kind of commitment before we go forward. 
Obviously I care about her a lot, but she keeps confusing me  with this ridiculous notion that "sex" and "love" are somehow connected. 
OK, two things: one, be honest, if this is a big deal to her do not take that next step unless you are sure, and second, and more importantly, in 2009 I have done it two more times than you. 
Give it up what, what. 
Whoo, do not leave a brother hanging. 
You're ready for Larry King Live tonight? 
You know it occurs for two hours straight just to get it out of my system you dumb bitch. 
 Oh, no.  Listen, we have a request, 
can you, please, try to remember to talk about TGS tonight? 
You only have to plug it once: "TGS, Fridays at 10:30 on NBC." 
You got it! "NGS Fridays 
at c-thirty on TB-10." 
Thank you. 
What's that, you're calling me, how's that possible? Hello!   
This phone was left in my cab by a woman wearing  the shirt of a man. 
 Ah, you left your phone in his car. 
 Hi, I'm Liz, you have my phone? 
 Yes. This is Asseef, 
I'm in Green's Taxi dispatch in Long Island City, you come? 
Yes, I will, thank you. 
Hey, why do you have Tracy Jordan's phone number in your address book? 
I work with him, if you want I could bring a signed photo. 
You bring 800 dollars, rich lady, or I throw the phone away. 
What? Oh, yeah, I'll definitely 
do that, on Opposite Day. 
I'm new to this country, is that a real thing? 
Hi baby, I got you something to remember me while I'm in Puerto Rico. 
It's a caricature of me on a skateboard. 
So I guess you're still planning on taking your trip? 
Well, I've been going home every winter for the last 15 years. 
I guess I could consider staying, if I knew where this was going. 
And the woman talk begins. 
Well played. Look, you know 
I'm serious about us, we're great together. 
We're Jack and Elisa -- Jalisa. 
That's really lame, Jack. 
Yeah that was just a joke. 
I don't wanna go all "Marc Anthony" on you, but I need to know how you feel. 
I love you. 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too, Jack Donaghy. 
Then you'll stay? 
OK, I'll stay. 
But if I have to give up my trip, then I want us to spend that time together. 
Just us, "Jalisa." 
Jonathan, clear my schedule for next week, starting with tonight. 
You won't be coming in at all? 
But what about "Jackonathon?" 
I think tonight is going to be a very special night. 
 If you know what I mean... 
 I think I do. 
Don't forget your skateboard. 
But then he scores a basket, even though he's not a wolf anymore. 
We're here with Tracy Jordan, who just recounted, by the way, the entire plot of the movie Teen Wolf. 
What? Oh, hold on, Tracy. 
My producers are telling me there is breaking news. 
The Asian financial markets have just opened to a huge sell-off,  and we're gonna switch to that story right now. 
 Good. I'm glad I'm here. 
Your thoughts, Tracy Jordan, on how this is gonna impact Wall Street. 
Larry, I'm not an expert, but I do have a strong opinion. 
New York as we know it will no longer exist tomorrow. 
 Expand on that! 
 Look, I grew up here, Larry,  in the days before Starbuck. 
and if Wall Street crashes, it will be the 1970s all over again. 
People will get mean, the streets won't be safe, it will be graffiti everywhere, and the movies are only cost three dollars. 
Tracy Jordan, saying three serious things, and then a joke. 
Oh, Jack, have you taken a gander at the Asian markets? 
The ??? index is off the charts! 
Well, good luck with that, Jorgensen but I'm on vacation now. 
But, I have these papers. 
 Hey, Jack, how are you doing? 
 Like a lion, ready to take its mate. 
How are you calling me? 
Ach, I lost my phone and this jagweed cabby has it. 
Hey, stop harassing my friends, Asseef. 
Hey, Liz, I just wanted to let you know that I found that special picture  that you took with your phone. 
 What picture? Oh my god! 
 Yes.  That one. 
 There's a picture on my phone. 
 An adult picture, of me. 
 What? 
Drew took it as a joke, I'm making a face like Why am I telling you this? 
Top-end bottom, may I speak with Asseef? 
 OK, what do you want? 
 2,000 cash or I email the picture to everyone in your address book. 
Have you been to Asia, Tracy? 
Oh, my work has taken me there, I was supposed to be in that movie Rush Hour but two weeks into shooting I was replaced by Jackie Chan. 
 OK, I'm going to get my phone. 
 You're gonna pay that guy? 
Well, it's, you know I need my address book and stuff. 
But I'm not going alone to meet some creep at a taxi garage. 
Will one of your guys go with me? 
 No ma'am. 
 Good luck. 
 I would, but I don't want to. 
 I will escort you, Miss Lemon. 
We pages are accustomed to danger. 
Thank you Kenneth, can you leave now, this place is in Queens. 
Oh, Miss Lemon, I can't leave Manhattan on page business. 
NBC's interns doesn't cover it. 
I'll have to do this as a friend. 
OK, fine. 
Say it. Say I'm your friend. 
Fine. You're my friend, 
Kenneth. Let's go. 
The Mumbay stock exchange is now down in early trading. 
Is this panic becoming global? 
Tracy Jordan, talk us through this. 
Larry, what everyone needs to do, is to take a deep breath, calm down, and start preparing their bodies for the Thunderdome. 
That is the new law. 
That's my TV! 
This is as far as we can get by subway. 
We need to find a cab. 
Hold, Miss Lemon, this is a pretty bad neighborhood. 
Aww, I just got tagged. 
Mr. Jordan and Mr. Larry King are right, 
New York is not safe anymore. 
And I'm not risking your life for a cell phone. 
It's not just a phone, Kenneth, it's what's on it. 
I don't understand, what could be so important? 
It wasn't something of sentimental value, was it? 
Yes, very sentimental. 
It's a song, a lullaby that my nana Lemon used to sing to me every night Oh, was it "The Day is Done My Sweet, For the Lambs Have Been Decapitated?" 
No, it was... a German song, 
she was German. 
And my nana got very sick recently, and I went to visit her and I had her singing it for me one final time and I recorded that on my phone and I'm glad that I did because she died a few hours later. 
It was my birthday. 
Miss Lemon, I am so sorry, would you sing it for me? 
* Hast du etwas Zeit für mich * * dann singe ich ein Lied für dich * Stop. Now that I know, 
the reason we are doing this is not only moral, but beautiful then I will not rest until I get my friend her phone. 
OK, come on. 
 That was amazing. 
 Thank you. 
I watched an American Masters last night about Baryshnikov. 
I picked up a couple of ideas. 
Our sushi. No, no, no, no, no, 
I'll get it. You'll need your rest, 
we're going again in 15. 
 Jack, you've got company. 
 Jack, why aren't you answering your phone? 
What are you doing here? 
People are freaking out about this Asia thing, and we can't find Geiss. 
He's AWOL, now everyone's looking to you, Jack. 
I don't care what's going on out there. 
I'm staying here. 
There are some things more important than a stock quote crawling across a screen. 
I'm in love with this magnificent woman, and there is no amount of money this company could lose that would cause me to yes, that's the amount, I'll get dressed right now. 
Bill Hewitt, Undersecretary of the Treasury, what advice can you give our viewers in these uncertain times? 
The worst thing you could do in a time like this is to pull out your investments, don't panic, because I think that Devil's avocado here, Larry, I think people should freak the geek out. 
 Withdraw all your money and hide it! 
 Interesting strategy. 
It's what I've always done. 
I hide cash everywhere. 
At home, at church, even at work. 
In fact, I've hidden so much money that if some of it was gone I'd probably wouldn't even notice. 
 Now why would you say that? 
 I don't know. 
Don't worry Miss Lemon, I'll protect you. 
Ah, it's just kids. 
What is going on with people? 
They took my wallet. 
 Was this your nana Lemon? 
 Yeah, she's the one we're doing this for. 
 She's dead, come on. 
 Wait, why is she wearing these glasses? 
This is from New Year's, but you said she died on your birthday, and that's in November. 
No, that's not a New Year's thing, that's the year she wanted to live to,  and she didn't make it. 
 Sing that lullaby again! 
* Hast du etwas Zeit für mich * * dann singe ich ein Lied für dich * Keep going. 
* von 99 Luftballons * I knew it! That's "99 Red Balloons," 
Nena's famous anti-balloon protest song. 
 You lied to me. 
 Yeah, alright, I lied, so what? 
You want the truth Kenneth, you want the truth? 
I can't handle the truth! 
There's an adult picture of me on that phone! 
Adult? You mean like you're 
driving a car or wearing a suit? 
It's a boobies picture, Kenneth,  and I only kept it because for once they were both pointing in the same direction. 
I knew you wouldn't help me if I told you the truth. 
So you lied to me? 
That's not something that friends do to each other. 
Then maybe we're not friends. 
 But we are! You said so before we left. 
 You made me say that! 
Well I guess then I'm here as a page in violation of NBC's interns policy. 
I should probably head back to Manhattan. 
Good. 
I don't need you! 
Co-worker! 
 Did you get hold of Geiss? 
 No. 
 Did you try his mistress? 
 Not there. 
 How about his manstress? 
 Nothing. I think we should listen 
 to Tracy Jordan and panic, sir. 
 What? 
I'm saying the disneyfication of New York is over, everyone. 
At the stroke of midnight, your Lexus is gonna turn back into a high-powered rats, fighting over a human finger. 
Joining us on the phone is GE Vice President Jack Donaghy, Jack, what's your outlook on all of this? 
I just wanna preach caution, Larry if there was anything to worry about I would be at my office. 
Instead of at home, right now, with my beautiful girlfriend. 
 She's Latin. 
 Expand on that. 
Look, my point is that some of the things that Tracy is saying are just fanning the flames. 
Hang on. I know Jack Donaghy, 
and that is an impostor. 
 Hang up! Hang up on him Larry! 
 I'm going to, but not because you told me. 
Lincoln, Nebraska, you are on the air. 
So is this what you'd rather be doing than spending time with me? 
 It smells like dude in here. 
 I tried to call you why didn't you pick up? 
Because I'm sick of listening to you. 
"Oh, I love you, Elisa." 
This was all just another Jack Donaghy lie. 
Like when you said you could dunk a basketball? 
I can, on a regulation hoop. 
Look, this is an emergency, if I'm not here, tonight What? What's gonna happen? 
People are gonna die? 
No. You'll all just get poor like the rest of us. 
You'll eat cereal that comes in a bag, and you'll keep the free hand wipes from the casino. 
You might even have to spend some time with your children. 
Who is this woman, why isn't someone shutting her up? 
Now why don't you just go back to my apartment and I will meet you there, eventually. 
Don't worry about it. 
I'm going to Puerto Rico! 
Elisa, don't do that, you don't understand. 
What's happening here is a once in a lifetime thing. 
So am I. 
Well, that was kind of neato, she just, whoop, flipped your words around on you. 
Sorry. 
 Forget it, we're never gonna find Tracy's money. 
 There's something under here! 
 It's nothing but a bunch of tarantula food. 
 What? I didn't even know Tracy had a tarantula. 
You know what? There's 
an easier way to do this. 
Our next caller is Pete from Manhattan,  Pete, was is your question? 
 Hey Larry, first time caller, I adore the show Hey, I'd recognize that voice anywhere Larry, that's my friend Peter Frampton on the phone. 
Ah, sure. 
Uh, sure, listen, Tracy I love the idea of hiding cash at work, could you be more specific about where you hid your money? 
Of course Pete, I hid my money in the safest place at 30 Rock. 
Without giving it away: the place I picked is very dry and warm. 
Its top is hard, but its bottom is soft. 
And although the location changes all the time, the money stays in the same place. 
If you're just joining us, we're with Tracy Jordan who is giving guitar icon Peter Frampton enigmatic clues about a secret treasure. Stay with us. 
Mr. Donaghy, this just arrived. 
It's from Mr. Geiss. 
Everything is gonna be alright. Geiss is back. 
 Jonathan, can we even play this thing? 
 Oh yes, I keep a VCR so I can watch your old football tapes. 
 Jonathan, what is that camcorder for? 
 Nothing. I don't know. 
Hello. If you're watching this, you're an executive 
of the General Electric Corporation and the unthinkable is happening. 
Capitalism is ending, either because of the Soviets or of something ridiculous,  like a woman president. 
 God, he looks so young. 
I'm speaking to you in the year 1987, but my message is timeless. 
Avoid... 
the night. 
We've all worked hard, but now it's over. 
There's only one thing for you to do. 
Go to your loved ones. 
Hold them close. 
Because in the end and if you're watching this it is the end, love is all that matters. 
How the hell am I gonna turn this damn thing off? 
What's that gizmo? 
Elisa? 
I was about to do the whole run-to-the-airport thing like Ross did on Friends and Liz Lemon did in real life. 
What are you doing here? 
The taxis want 500 bucks to go to J.F.K. 
and the buses are worse. 
Everything's gone cocoa for cuckoo poops! 
 Is that right? 
 Elisa, listen to me. 
I meant everything I said but I know that that's just words, you want commitment. 
Here it is: Let's get married. 
 Jack! 
 I love you, Elisa and I don't wanna be with anyone else. 
Okay. 
But I want a ring so big,  that it gives me back problems. 
 That's my phone, I'm Liz Lemon. 
 Where is the 2,000 dollars? 
I don't have it, I lost all my money and my bank card's in my retainer. Geez. 
Please, Asseef, give me my phone. 
Maybe you could call a friend to get the money or, wait! 
Every number in this address book is a work number. 
Work number, work number, work number. 
You have no friends. 
Yes. I. Am. 
OK, you have 2,000 dollars? 
No. 
I'm gonna watch TV until you come up with my money. 
Maybe you get it through sex trade. 
You're a pretty young thing. 
 You're disgusting. 
 I'm not talking to you. 
 Frank, calm down. 
 It's not in here. 
This isn't about the money, this is about my own issues  with Liz. 
 Stop it! 
We have Peter Frampton on the phone again. 
Come on, Tracy, just tell us where the money is, where's the safest place in 30 Rock? 
 Is that Pete? 
 I already told you, it's dry and warm, its top is hard but its bottom is soft, and although the location changes,  it's always in the same place. 
There's nothing like that in 30 Rock, nothing. 
I never said it was a "thing." 
It's me. 
I am the safest place in 30 Rock. 
I would thank you to give the lady its cell phone back. 
Thank you for coming back, Kenneth, you're a good friend. 
 You mean it? 
 Yes! 
Because I'm having an asbestos removal party in my apartment on Sunday, Yeah, I'm in. 
Now that the US markets have opened unaffected by the Asian melt-down, many people are blaming the panic in New York last night on one man, Tracy Jordan. 
He is here with me now. Tracy, a lot of of people 
are calling you a "fear monger," and, I'm quoting here, "an idiot." 
What do you have to say for yourself? 
Watch TGS Fridays at 10:30 on NBC! 
Word. 
 Morning Jonathan. 
 Good morning sir, crazy night last night. 
Lots of emotions, people getting carried away. 
Yes, it was a crazy night. Is Elisa here? 
We're having a couples spa day. 
She came by earlier, she asked me to give you this, she said to just press "play." 
Hi Jack, I'm on my way to Puerto Rico. 
I'm sorry. 
Yesterday was crazy, lots of emotion. 
I think maybe you asked me what you asked me out of panic. 
So, I'm gonna go see my family and give us both a chance to think about everything. 
OK, I'll call you. 
Adiós mi amor. 
Aww, how do you turn this damn thing off? 
No! 
That's personal. 
﻿1 Hi. 
I'm looking for an engagement ring. 
Are you sure? 
Maybe you should have had a ring The first time you proposed  then Elisa wouldn't have said no. 
 She didn't say no. 
 She said we should think about it. 
 Yeah, that does not mean yes. 
In my experience, "let's think about it" usually ends up with me watching solid gold in my basement on prom night. 
The point is I have thought about it, and I haven't changed my mind. 
In fact, I've coined a new term to describe what Elisa is to me:  The one. 
 The one? 
As in the only one for me. 
The one I'm meant to be with. 
Get it? The one. 
Yeah, you should be a writer. 
Whoa, check out the bling! 
Or whatever it's called now. 
 Aah! 
 Huh! 
 Good god. 
 I got it! 
Oh, god, there's a vent! 
She's very... Spirited. 
Like a show horse. 
 You're a lucky man. 
 Oh, no, no. She's not the bride. 
 This is the one I am marrying. 
 Oh, my apologies, sir. 
Please follow me to the real showroom. 
 Yes. 
 My finger is caught in the vent. 
Hey, where are my snow balls? 
I was gonna go to the gym later, so I deserve a treat. 
Oh, Miss Lemon, we can't have coconut products out anymore because of staff allergies. 
What? No, allergies are psychosomatic. 
The only reason I'm allergic to dogs is because one bit me  the first time I got my period. 
 No, allergies are real. 
If I have a strawberry, my throat shuts up  Faster than a girl in math class. 
 I didn't know you had allergies. 
You know if my cousin Stephanie eats a walnut, Her throat shuts up faster than a Filipino at a... 
Guys! Come on. Not okay. 
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Rossitano, 
no unauthorized food. 
Don't worry, no food in here, Kenneth. 
Just a doughnut box with a mouse in it. 
Oh, are the pranks-men going after Lutz again? 
Someone say my name? 
 Hey, look. 
 Awesome! Doughnuts! 
Aah! Aah! 
Oh! 
Hey, we've narrowed it down, Liz Lemon. 
Oh, great. 
What are we talking about? 
Tracy has to get a present for his wife. 
This Saturday is the 20th anniversary of the night that me and Angie met. 
She was working at the Dyker Heights Arthur Treacher's, and I was residing there. 
She slipped me a free shrimp combo, and we've been together ever since. 
So this present has to be special. 
It's either gonna be a denim jacket that says "hot bitch" in diamonds... 
 Uhhuh. 
 Or a slanket. 
Yeah, Angie doesn't want that. 
Why don't you just ask Angie what she wants instead of spending all this money on junk? 
You are wise, Liz Lemon. 
Like a genetically manipulated shark. 
So as a token of my gratitude, I got something specially for you. 
Wow. 
I'll take that slanket too if you're not gonna use it. 
 Puerto Rican! 
 That's interesting. 
I mean Puerto Rico, where you're supposed to be. 
 When did you get back? 
 Actually, Lemon, three weeks ago. 
 What? Why doesn't Jack know that? 
 Because I don't know what to do. 
I'm afraid he's gonna want to go through with his proposings of marriage. 
Sorry, I haven't spoken English in two menses. 
Are you saying that you don't want to go through with his proposings of marriage? 
I don't understand, Elisa. 
You love him. 
 I do. That's why I call him "El Uno. " 
 Yeah. 
But I cannot marry him because of a terrible secret. 
 Please don't ask me what it is. 
 I won't. I don't want to know. 
 Are you a man? 
 Really? 
That's your guess, a man? 
 You want to see me naked? 
 Sort of. 
I love Jack so much. 
I don't think I have the strength to tell it to his head. 
 That's why I was hoping that you... 
 Oh, no, no, no! 
Oh, thank you for doing what I cannot. 
Good-bye forever, Liz Lemon. 
Well, I see why he likes it. 
I hope you guys have learned a lesson. 
Because of what you did, we almost lost a monitor. 
I'm sorry. 
You're a big fan of mine, and you're not gay? 
 Not even bicurious? 
 I don't know what to tell you. 
I love your show. 
I read your blog. 
I've got all your albums. 
Even the one you did with Phil Spector. 
I still think that would have sold much better If he had shot me in the face. 
Well, I'm glad you didn't get shot in the face. 
 Thank you. 
 But if you had... 
I would have liked to have gotten that call. 
That would have been nice. 
Jenna, Us Weekly is calling to confirm a story that your animal rescue shelter is supplying quesadilla meat to amusement parks. 
What?! 
I need to call my lawyer. 
I'll be right back. 
Don't go anywhere. 
Dude, we have got to go man. 
I stole some pens. 
Mr. Lutz, this is my telephone number. 
Please give it to Jenna Maroney. 
You okay? 
Good! 
Hey Jack, do you have a sec? 
It's over Lemon. 
It's over before it started. 
 Drink with me. 
 I'm Sorry, but I'm glad it didn't have to come from me. 
 What are you talking about? 
 What are you talking about? 
Wigo.com, Sheinhart's Wigs 
user generated video content site. 
All anybody posted on it were penises. 
 What did you want to talk to me about? 
 Hey, Jack... Right... Okay... 
I've been trying to figure out how to  not tell you this... 
 Oh mi amor. 
 Querida! 
 I'm Back. Let's Get married. 
I'll call Pablo to have them hold the table. 
So we can celebrate in style. 
And carbo-load for the reunion sex. 
Lemon, isn't it wonderful? 
Don't dare say anything about what I told you about my secret. 
I'm not going to, because you have to. 
 baby cried the day the circus came to town.  
 Uh... You okay? 
 Oh, I didn't see you there. 
I'm fine. 
 Don't cry out loud!  
You sure you don't want to talk about something? 
Well, it's kinda none of your business. 
But all right. 
I met this cute paramedic yesterday. 
He thinks I'm incredible, we're perfect for each other. 
But he left before I could get his name. 
Well, I'm sure there's a way to find out. 
I called 911, they wouldn't even connect me to their celebrity service. 
I don't know what to do! 
You know, your dilemma reminds me of a book I read once. 
 See ya later Pete. 
 No, no, listen, listen. 
There's this question psychiatrists use to identify sociopaths. 
A woman goes to her mother's funeral, where she meets the perfect man, it's love at first sight. 
But he leaves before she finds out who he is. So... 
What does she do to see him again? 
She kills her father hoping that the guy will come to that funeral too. 
That's correct! 
Oh boy... 
 Thanks for the advice. 
 No, no, no. That wasn't advice. 
But of course she'd also have to kill her father's doorman, and anyone else who might have seen her and you for giving her the idea in the first place. 
 Liz Lemon, you dummy! 
 I'm Wearing it as a joke. 
I asked Angie what she wanted for our anniversary and she wants me to get a tattoo of her name Oh, okay, you like tattoos. 
And above it she wants this picture of her face. 
I can't have this on my chest scaring off beautiful women in the clubs. 
 Tracy... 
 You know I like to socialize Liz Lemon. 
and you know my signature move with the ladies. 
 is taking off my shirt! 
 Is taking off your shirt! 
Now it's a Sophie's choice. 
I can't get this tattoo, and I can't tell Angie no. 
What do you want me to say Tracy? 
I'm sorry I made it harder for you to cheat on your wife? 
That's a start Liz Lemon. 
That's a start! 
Strawberries! 
My real name is Diplin! 
Oh, somebody call the cute guy at 911! 
Lemon I need to ask you something about Elisa. 
Did she say anything to you, anything at all, about a secret... 
 Desire to keep her maiden name? 
 Oh, no, sorry. 
Because I'd like her to be Elisa Donaghy, but if she wants to be Elisa Padriera Donaghy... 
Elisa Padriera? 
Ah! 
 Viuva negra! 
 What? 
 What does that mean? 
 The black widow! 
Elisa has a terrible secret, my current theory is she's the mother of those Michael Jackson's kids. 
Okay, I searched Elisa Padriera and the black widow, But all the web sites are in Spanish. 
 Blue writing on green. Why?! 
 Call that cleaning lady back. 
 We need somebody who speaks Spanish. 
 I speak Spanish. 
 Puerto Rican! 
 La viuva negra! 
Really, Lemon? 
 Jack, let me explain. 
 Elisa, there is nothing you can say That will change the way I feel. 
I'm so sorry to tell you such a dark tale while wearing such a silly T-shirt. 
I was married once, and I killed my husband. 
It was a crime of passion. 
He cheated on me. 
And in a rage I took my revenge. 
You know me, Jack. 
I'm a Catholic. 
I take the bonds of marriage very seriously. 
 Why aren't you in jail? 
 They threw my case out. 
I couldn't get an impartial jury after that song about me came out. 
 Elisa, Elisa   La viuda negra   Elisa  I guess I'm glad you know. 
I understand if this changes everything. 
It's up to you. 
My god, I already put my wedding announcement in cigar aficionado. 
How about this? 
You get the tattoo, but when you hit the clubs, you draw a mane around the face with a marker, and make it look like a lion named "Tangiers". 
Dotcom, that is a great idea! 
If you want everyone to think I own a gay lion! 
 Tangiers?! 
 No judgment in brainstorming. 
Look, this is my reputation we're talking about here! 
Use your heads! 
The Moroccan national soccer team is the lions. 
Tangiers is in Morocco. 
So, yeah, I guess I'm an idiot. 
Have you ever met anyone that's killed somebody? 
I think my grandpa may have. 
But he never really liked to talk about what happened at Kent State. 
I still want to marry Elisa. 
 Wow, you do? Really? 
 So she had one bad day. 
Being in a relationship means overlooking certain flaws. 
I mean, somewhere right now, a guy is on a j-date with Monica Lewinsky. 
Nobody's perfect. 
 Jack! 
 I'm 50. 
To put it in perspective, that's like 32 for ladies. 
How many more Elisas am I going to meet? 
Okay, well, God bless. 
I guess I just really don't understand men. 
Nobody ever said you did, Lemon. 
Nyah... 
Pardon me. 
Excuse me. 
I'm sorry, what are you two doing here? 
Where's the hot guy? 
Ma'am, are you taking any medication? 
Yes. Where's the cute paramedic 
who was here last night? 
He was wearing a uniform. 
He was totally into me. 
If he was here at night, he must work the evening shift. 
So there are different shifts? 
Like on a Sheik's pleasure yacht. 
Thank you. 
Lemon. 
It's not product placement. 
I just like it. 
 What? 
 What? 
What if I marry Elisa and I accidentally cheat? 
She could snap again. 
She's very passionate, and she doesn't react well to betrayal. 
Why won't you open?! 
Yes. What a quandary. 
Oh, wait, I have a suggestion... 
 Don't cheat. 
 But you never know, Lemon. 
What if I find myself stranded in a snow cave with a stern but comely lady geologist, both of us knowing that our only chance for survival is the heat from our naked bodies? 
 Sorry, I just do not get you guys. 
 Again, that is not being disputed. 
But my options for male advice around here are limited. 
So I think the pranks-men should all wear fedoras. 
 Could the hats have feathers? 
 Yes! Yes! 
Face it, you are the closest thing to a man working here right now. 
Well, dude, I guess you gotta find a comely geologist and a snow cave and see what happens. 
Tracy, I need your help. 
My fiancee murdered her ex-husband when he cheated on her. 
 Continue. 
 I love her. 
But the only way I can make sure that I won't stray... 
is for me to arrange a test of erotic temptation. 
 Yes. 
 Exactly. 
We're going out tonight, Jackie D, and you're gonna be tempted like Jesus in the wilderness. 
Jesus is my stereo guy, and the Wilderness is a club I took him to once. 
Jenna, come quick. 
Kenneth's passed out again. 
Oh, no, I can't believe this is happening during night shift! 
Oh, for god sakes! 
What is this, third watch? 
Somehow Kenneth ate strawberries again, and now he's gone into acute strawberry shock. 
 Is that a thing? 
 Just ask this real EMT. 
We're gonna have to cut off his hands to get the sickness out. 
He's gonna have to learn how to urinate with his feet. 
 How could this have happened again?! 
 It's my fault. I did it. 
I just wanted that hot EMT to come back. 
I didn't mean for it to go this far. 
Oh Kenneth, I'm so sorry. 
But I am not a monster. 
I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy she poisoned So this other boy would go to town on her. 
 I think she's had enough, sirs. 
 Aw, Kenneth! 
What's happening? 
Is this a trick? I knew it! 
I was just playing along. 
No, seriously, what's happening? 
Jenna, do you feel genuine remorse? 
Thank god. 
Sociopath downgraded to extreme narcissist. 
Now quit it with the strawberry stuff. 
Or you might once again feel the righteous lash of the pranks-men. 
Is that a thing? 
Hey, Tray. 
 You and your friend wanna party later? 
 Sure thing, baby. 
Give the kid a call. 
 Holla. 
 This is decadent? 
And I once went to Miami with Darryl Strawberry. 
Tip of the iceberg, Jackie D. 
You can have all of this whenever you want. 
Or you can marry that nice lady that you're in love with. 
 It's up to you. 
 Look, I love Elisa. 
 But you love Angie, right? 
 Of course I do. Angie's the one. 
The one? 
Where did you hear that? 
It's a thing I made up after seeing the Matrix. 
Well, Elisa is my one. 
But Tracy, sometimes I think men like us aren't built for marriage. 
Okay, this is something I've never told anyone. 
This is my terrible secret. 
In the 20 years that I've known her... 
I've never cheated on my wife. 
There. 
I said it. 
Don't look at me. 
Wait a minute. 
That can't be the truth. 
The partying is just for show. 
And because I'm a high-functioning alcoholic. 
All the phone numbers you see me hand out, They're not even mine. 
Hello? 
No, this isn't Tracy Jordan. 
Really? 
I've not heard of that term before. 
Do you know how to get to Connecticut? 
Oh, my god. 
That's an inspiration. 
 I mean, if you can do it... 
 So can you. 
Because I'm a ridiculous, unstable human being. 
What is wrong with me? 
I mean, if Elisa's only flaw is that she demands I be faithful, Then I will be faithful! 
And if Angie wants me to get a tattoo of her to prove my love,  then I'm getting that tattoo! 
Grizz, get the car. 
Dotcom, get the coats. 
And which one of you ladies wants to pick up the tab? 
Oh, me! Me! 
I put strawberry juice in your chickpeas. 
And in your water. 
 And on your harmonica. 
 My what? 
Oh, you mean my mouth radio? 
I am so sorry, Kenneth. 
I just want you to know that I would not do this to you for just any guy. 
He was special. 
I really thought that he was... 
 The one. 
 Oh, Miss Maroney, it's horrible to think you might have found your true love,  but only to lose him. 
 It hurts more than my foot botox to know that he's out there, and I have no way to find him. 
When you call 911, tell them they have to send everyone. 
 Earn... This! 
 Oh... 
You remarkable son of a bitch! 
We have an emergency! 
 workin' on my night cheese  Oh! 
Jack? 
Do you know what time it is? 
I was sound asleep. 
I heard you singing "night cheese". 
Lemon, I've had a crazy night. 
We all can learn a lot from Tracy Jordan. 
We went out clubbing. 
His life is like Enron, 1999. 
 It's wild. 
 I'm sure it was. 
How are you so quiet when your parades are so loud? 
You were supposed to be thinking about us. 
And you spent the whole night partying with that black guy! 
 Did she not come here with you? 
 Have you been following me? 
And then you come here at 4:00 in the morning?! 
I knew your relationship was too weird not to be sexual! 
Okay, everybody be cool. 
Wait a minute, you're jealous of Lemon? 
That's insane. 
Yeah,come on, look at me. 
 Ooh. 
 Elisa, I proved to myself tonight that I would never cheat on you. 
That's why I went out with Tracy. 
And I came to Liz's because... 
 Because she's your bro. 
 Exactly. 
 Oh... 
 Elisa, this is troubling. 
And how do you think I feel? 
I get a ring on my finger for one day and I start acting like Glenn Close  in "Atraccion Fatal". 
 Oh, that has a whole different title here. 
Lemon, isn't there a slanket somewhere you should be filling with your farts? 
Shoo. 
Baby, this is my curse. 
I love too deeply. 
And eventually it makes me loco for choco-puffs. 
Querida, if you ever find yourself less in love with me, I hope you'll give me a call. 
But if tonight is what it's going to be like, obviously, engagement-wise, we are not going to forge ahead. 
Is it my English? Or was that 
not a great breaking-up speech? 
It was your English. 
That was quite moving. 
Boy, you look happy. What, did you settle 
that lawsuit over your exercise tape? 
Even better. 
I had an amazing date last night. 
 And it's all thanks to Kenneth. 
 Oh, it was nothing. 
Sure, I was legally dead for five minutes,  But I did it for true love. 
 Well actually,  it turns out Roger has sole custody Of his five-year-old son,  So pffft! 
 Wait a minute, you were dead? 
 Oh, I'm fine. 
But I think I brought something back with me. 
Tracy, did you even go home last night? 
And where is your shirt? 
No, and at large. 
I might've went out and had a little too much to drink last night, but you'll be proud of me, Liz Lemon "Cool J". 
'cause I went out and got that tattoo Angie wanted me to get. 
Pow! 
How you like me now? 
Wow, that is one gay lion. 
Hey,guys! Four days till vacation 
week. Where are we all going? 
Nowhere. We don't get next week off. 
We gotta load out thse, take 'em to storage. 
Then at night,i gotta drive around newark lookin' for my runaway daughter. 
Oh,what happened to your hand? 
Oh,i was trying out my spray tan for my trip to st. Bartleby's next week. 
Oh,miss lemon, how could you do that to your beautiful hands? 
With your flat, manly milking thumbs and your long, graceful knuckle hair Thank you,kenneth. 
Are you sick? 'Cause i am not 
getting sick before my trip. 
The place i go to has private beaches, soft serve ice cream machines, And,after the french custom, people wear dark socks to the beach. 
It's the one thing i do for myself every year, and i am going. 
Look,i even bought a new swimsuit. 
What is that? 
It's called a tankoort,cerie. 
You may have seen it inus weekly, being worn by dame judi dench... 'S mother. 
Kenneth... 
Don't worry,miss lemon. I never get sick. 
I have the constitution of an ox. 
Oh,no. I must have ox fever! 
When did i walk barefoot near an ox? 
You have the flu. Go home. 
You are not ruing my vacation! 
 Liz,wait. Did you get that swim... Thing for your vacation? 
 Yeah. 
 You know it's canceled,right? 
 No! What? What are you talking about? 
The hotel was overbooked. I texted you. 
No,you no,you didn't. 
Oh,i forgot to hit send. 
Just hold on a second. There ya go. 
I got a great reservation to celebrate our first real date. 
Now,have you ever had sushi? 
I once had a very undercooked fish sandwich at a parade. 
I guess that counts. 
Oh,no,but... 
I can only stay for five minut. 
I have to go back to work. 
I thought today was your day off. 
I have another patient on my off days. 
He's a sweet old man with advanced dementia. 
Totally disconnected from reality. 
Well,that reminds me. 
I owe lou dobbs a call. 
Elisa,are you telling me that you work seven days a week? 
Yes,i have two jobs. 
That's what regular people do,you know? 
Especially those whose grandmothers are addicted to online poker. 
Don't let that keep us apart. 
When are you back with my mother? 
 I'll cook you dinner. 
 Jack... 
Your house is my workplace. 
Plus,colleen doesn't seem to like that we're together. 
I hope you know she acts like that because she hates every woman i like. 
It's not because you're a... 
I'm sorry, what do you call yourself? 
A puerto rican. 
No,i know you can say that, but what do i call you? 
A puerto rican. 
That does not sound right.

 30 Rock Season03 Episode08 Oh,miss lemon. 
Mr. Donaghy wants to see 
you in the green room. 
Kenneth, why are you still here? 
Ohdon't worry about me. I'm a-oh-boy. 
I should be going to the caribbean. 
Instead,i'm stuck here with you and a bunch of guys named sully. 
 Miss lemon? 
 Sully! 
Brett favre,right? 
Jack,i ne task you to drop your pants. 
That's it. 
Have a sucker. 
Lemon,there you are. 
Leo's giving out flu shots. 
Not my favorite part of the medical profession. 
My favorite part is attending executions. 
Can i ask you a question as a woman? 
You may,jack. Are you going to alter 
your voice or dress up in any way? 
 Liz. 
 Sorry. 
I don't know what to do about elisa. 
She works all the time. 
You know she's second generation puerto rican. 
Jack,you can't call her that! 
That's what i thought. 
With work and everything, it's just turning out to be complicated. 
You said the same thing about c. 
Count yourself lucky you're getting one of these. 
He only has five left. 
Lemon,i need you to tell me who on your staff is important enou to get one. 
Hold on. You're rationing 
health care? That's not okay. 
Yes,lemon. 
Important people get better health care. 
They also get better restaurant reservations, bigger seats in planes. 
A more refined class of prostitute. 
For me,it's really about the companionship. 
Like it or not, you're one of us now, one of the elite. 
No,i'm not. I am from white haven, 
P.a.my grandfather dug 
out the white haven quarry, And my other gndfather filled it back in with the sludge from the eraser factory. 
I am still way more like those people than you. 
And i don't want anything they don't get. 
Lemon,you don't wanna get sick. 
It's not about that. It's about 
fairness. I don't want the shot. 
When is modern science gonna find a cure for a woman's mouth? 
Jack! What are you doing here? 
Making this work. 
Look,i brought some dinner and monopoly. 
We can have a fun, low-key night... Unless i lose. 
That is sweet. But very inappropriate. 
Get in before somebody sees you. 
The agency would fire me if they knew i was having guests! 
Well... Who's going to tell them? Him? 
Hey,it's me, matlock. I need your help. 
Okay,very funny, jack. 
Elisa... 
You work so hard. 
Don't you think you deserve some time for yourself? 
Of course i do. 
I've been living in new york for 15 years, And i've never seen a broadway play or been in a restaurant that didn't have a tv in it Or had a romantic dinner with a man in a suit. 
Okay,you can stay. 
But it's not all gonna be fun and games. 
Mr. Templeton's foot is still healing. 
Of course...You do 
your job,and i'll just what is wrong with it? Is that a beak? 
 Yes! 
 No. 
Yes! 
Liz... Tracy says kauai is more 
beautiful than maui and keeps shouting When i try to give my opinion, which is that... 
 Blahblahblah! Blahblahblah! 
 Kauai is too rustic. 
 Maui is the windsurfing capital of the world! - Blah-blah-blah! 
Guys,come on,we have to shoot these promos. 
Oh,my god,jack gave you two flu shots? 
He said it was a flu shot. 
But know it's really a truth serum. 
It's not a truth serum. 
Them why ayou you look like tootsie today? 
You two should be ashamed of yourselves. 
The crew is on death's door, and you're arguing about hawaii? 
If i were you, i'd be doi something special to thank them. 
 That would make us look pretty great. 
 Yeah. 
Kenneth,i'm considering giving you one of the remaining flu shots. 
No need,sir. 
It would be an honor to die at my post and be given the traditional burial of a parcell man Wrapped in a confederate flag, fried,and fed to dogs. 
Are you ready for your shot? 
Never. Two-tiered 
health care is a crime. 
You know,in cuba,everybody gets equal health care. 
What a surprise-- you've seen the michael moore movie. 
Think again,jack. 
I saw the trailer when i went to seealvin and the chipmunks. 
But this flu shot rationing is baloney. 
If my crew can't get a shot, i'm not getting a shot. 
Hey,you tell him,liz! 
God bless you... Crewman. 
 We gotta fight the power. 
 Yeah! 
Oh,boy. 
 Fight the powers that be! 
 Yeah! 
That's right just makes me wanna shoop! 
Shoop,shoop,shoop,shoop! 
Mr. Jordan,miss moroney, 
you wanted to see me? 
Kenneth,tracy and i wanna do something for the crew... 
You know,to thank them for being sick. 
We didn't know what to get them. 
But then i had a brainstorm! 
It was a bad one. 
Jenna had to put my tongue guard in. 
But after he stabilized, we decided we'd get them all hot soup. 
So... Go do that. 
All the other pages have gone home sick. 
I can't make any runs right now. 
Maybe... The two of you 
could go get the soup? 
I don't understand. 
Well,i'm saying you could get your wallet... 
 My what?  And go 
downstairs to the basement  no! 
 Then you go to the soup place and bring the soup back up here. 
 With what,my arms? 
 Make sure to take your ids with you. 
That'd be the worst part! 
Wait. Tracy, we have to do this. 
Without the crew, we'd just be two amazing people succeeding in a vacuum. 
Come on,do it for them. 
Yeah. For the crew. 
'Cause it's their birthday. 
I had a woerful time last night. 
Yeah,i did too. 
Are you with mr. Templeton now? 
How i envy him. 
I wish you would exercise my muscles so they don't atrophy. 
Well,are you coming over tonight? 
We can finish our game of monopoly. 
Of course i am. I'm just 
gonna be a little late. 
I have tickets to a special ary performance ofthe lion king. 
I wish i could convince you to go with me. 
You know i can't,jack. 
Are you kidding me? 
I'd love to go out, get all dressed up, tip maitre d's and be all like... 
"thank you,roger. 
This table was super-duper." 
I live in the big apple, but i spend all my time with the big vegetable. 
Why can't i have fun like an upper middle class person? 
Why can't you? 
You sound just like lemon. Come with 
me tonight. Be a member of the elite. 
hey,liz. 
Just wanna let you know we appreciate what you said before. 
So in order to thank you, we got you a meat plate. 
Thanks,guys! I am 
really... Going to eat this. 
Enjoy. 
******** Hey,cerie,what is this text you sent me supposed to mean? 
Your vacation is back on. 
Well,how is that any easier wait. My vacation's back on? 
Yeah. I guess since this flu, 
there's been a bunch of cancellatns. 
I'm so happy the number 4,the letter u. 
Thank you,banyani. 
Thank you,oscar. 
Oh,god,they're all sick! 
You're all diseased! 
I can't get sick. I can't get sick! 
Stay away,sick lutz! 
Miss lemon I have revision pages for you! 
Oh,my god,pete! Thank god it's you! 
Liz,what's wrong? 
Why? 
Gimme the shot. I 
wanna go on my vacation. 
I take back all the stuff i said! 
If you want a shot... 
You're going to have to dance for it. 
Very nice. 
i'm such a hypocrite. 
You have to promise me you won't tell anyone i'm getting this shot. 
Liz,i believe doctor/patient confidentiality is a two-way street. 
I'm cheating on my wife. 
Hey,where have you guys been? 
We were supposed to shoot promos like an hour ago. 
Okay,we forgot about that. 
But we have a good reason. 
Yeah,we were out tting soup for the crew. 
No. We forgot about that too. 
We were out shoppin' together. We had fun,though. 
Every girl crazy 'bout a sharp i get it,you went shopping. 
I don't need the montage. 
Yeah. I tried on a lotta outfits. 
And some of them, i was like-- no. 
But them some of them, i was like,yeah! 
So we' running behind because you guys forgot to get soup. 
Is there anything you do that doesn't make my life harder? 
I can't believe we forgot the soup. 
We have to think of something else. 
I know. 
I also wanna thank you for controlling yourself sexually while we spent time together on this adnture. 
Hey,liz, how you feeling? 
You got this bug yet? 
I'm a little achy. 
Probably 'cause i didn't get the shot. 
You should go home, sweetheart. You don't want this. 
No way,dude. If you're 
workin',i'm workin'. 
Hey,that liz lemon's okay. 
Why do we hate her guts so much? 
Lemon, we actually went on a date last night, elisa and i, and it was magical. 
Oh,my purse! 
You took the old man with you? 
I admit it's an ethical gray area. 
No! It's just wrong. 
Yes,well,we all can't be as noble as you, turning down a flu shot on moral grounds, Coming into work and risking your health despite your special vacation. 
It's called principles,jack. 
I think i'm probably getting it. 
Oh,that reminds me.About 24 hours 
after receiving the flu shot, you develop a distinctive rash at the injection site. 
So please let makeup know for tracy and jenna. 
I wasn't resting. 
A parcell man never lies down on the job. 
Unless that job involves milking pig teats. 
Miss lemon,what is that? 
Did you... Did you get the shot? 
No,no,no. This is a dream. 
You're having a fever dream. 
We're speaking french, and i'm your mother. 
Oh,ma cherie man, pourquoi? 
Pourquoi m'as tu laisse? 
What are we doing tonight? 
It's a surprise. 
But he's gonna need a helmet. Come here. 
It's mr. Templeton's son! 
I thought you said he didn't have any family. 
Not here. He lives in london. 
But now god has sent him to punish me for being so bad. 
Or maybe it's a business trip. 
You need to hide. I 
cannot lose this job. 
I'd have to go back to work in the late shift at dunkin' donuts. 
The customers are so sad. 
 Can i help you? 
 Yes. 
What time do you start throwing out donuts? 
He's coming in! 
 There ya are. 
 Of course. I'm here. Always. 
Sorry to surprise you. I just wanted 
to... Check on dad. How's he doin'? 
Well,he's stable but vegetative. 
Totally unaware of his surroundings. 
A man comes at night. 
 He comes to the house and takes me. 
 Dad! 
Okayth's surprising. 
He wears a suit. 
His hair is thick, like a bolshevik commissar. 
He made me watch a giraffe with the legs of a man! 
Dad,it's me,michael. 
He gave money to a silver man. 
 He ate a plate of fire! 
 D... 
There's no man. 
Yes! He was in prison. 
But now he owns a railroad. 
What is going on? 
Why is he all worked up? 
You know,sometimes they watch cartoons, and they think it's real. It's very common. 
Tracy,i got it! 
Give it to me! It's mine! 
No. I know what we can get the crew. 
They don't need soup. 
They need medicine, and what's the best medicine? 
Medicine? 
Laughter. 
Do you see where i'm going with this? 
No! 
Well,he's finally asleep. 
You must be exhausted. 
Why don't you go to bed? 
No,thanks. I'm not tired. 
Oh,good. 
Because there is something in the other room that i need to show you, And i won't remember what it is until i see it. 
The dark man is here! 
He's come to take me! 
No,shh,sir,no! 
I did things during the war-- terrible things. 
Mr. Templeton, my name is jack, and 
i'm just a guy dating your nurse, And i took advantage of your condition so i could be with her. 
Do you understand what i'm saying? 
What we did was wrong, but weid it for the greatest reason of all. 
You see,i've lost too many good things because i couldn't make time for them, And i can't let that happen with elisa. 
Is elisa the puerto rican? 
Wow,that really doesn't sound okay. 
But yes,and i beg you... 
 Please don't tell your son. 
 All right. 
But the next time we go out, i wanna go to washington square park. 
It's where i proposed to my wife. 
And then... I wanna go to a negro bar. 
I'll see what i can do. 
 Attention,ladies and germs and gentlemen! 
 Hey,liz! 
Are you ready to feel better? 
'Cause we have just the thing! 
 Soup? 
 No! 
Now,in the grand tradition of patch adams, Prepare yourself for the comic stylings of tracy the amazing and jenna! 
Really? Do you really 
think this is helping? 
 Leave her alone! 
 Yeah! 
What? Why aren't you laughing? 
This is happening to liz! 
Noth love liz now. Everybody likes me. 
 It's you two idiots  hey,what's that on your arm? 
She got a flu shot! 
She-- she lied to us! 
Give us back our meat plate! 
No,guys,listen! You don't understand! 
 This vacation  you sold us out for a vacation? 
No! Not just a vation. 
This one has beach socks and ice cream and sandwich turtles. 
I work so hard,guys. Don't 
i deserve to sit on a ach? 
 Je vous deteste! 
 Yeah! 
It's not what you think. 
There is a gentleman involved. 
A filipino gentleman. 
Is name is banyani. 
I want to take him as my island lover. 
Last year, he was totally sending signals, and this time, i was gonna go for it. 
There. I said it! Are you happy? 
It kinda peters out after that. 
I just... Suck pie off my 
sweatshirt for the next half hour. 
I'm so embarrassed. 
Well,that goes without saying. 
But the good news is is that your relationship with the crew is back where it should be, And now you can go on your vacation guilt-free. 
No,i can't. I feel like a jerk. 
Oh,come on,lemon. Embrace your elitism. 
What do we elites do when we screw up? 
We pretend it never happened and ve ourselves a giant bonus. 
That you don't deserve. I 
don't deserve to go anywhere. 
Says who? 
What elisa and i did wasn't right, but we're happier now. 
And you're going to be happier when you go to st.Bartleby's 
and get whatever's left of your groove back. 
Face it,lemon, not everyone gets a shot. 
Not everyone gets to go to the caribbean. But you're special. 
You're better. 
So go. Go to your... Island lover. 
Yeah. All right,yes. I'm gonna. 
Did that come out of you or me? 
I don't know. 
It's really hot in here. 
You know,the flu vaccine is actually a small dose of the virus itself. 
So there's always the risk that both ends.Both ends! 
I'm not gonna make it! 
 Hello? 
 Lemon. Good morning. 
What... what is that sound? 
Are you frying bacon? 
No,it's my new running shoes. 
Come on. Lemon,I'm going over the guest 
list for my fiftieth birthday party. 
and you haven't gotten RSVPed. 
Oh,right. Sorry. My 
mail's been piling up. 
And I keep forgetting to buy toilet paper. So. 
What is that supposed to mean? 
Nothing,i'm coming. 
Good. And don't wear 
that thing with a belt. 
What thing with a belt? Don't hang 
up. I have a lot of belts that... 
Ugh,what is this idiot doing? 
I will be brief. I have decided to 
fulfill my dream of going into space. 
If you have a spaceship and are looking for a hillarious astronaut with an irregular heartbeat and thirty million dollars. 
I'm prepared to leave as soon as tomorrow. 
I wrote that yesterday. I 
will not be taking questions. 
 Hello,dummy. 
 No! 
Nope,not interested. Have a good life. 
It's important. It's about my mom. 
That was a lie. 
But listen,Elizabeth. I recently 
discovered that I'm a sex addict. 
 No,you're not. 
 Yeah,yeah. 
I'd be an even worse sex addict if I wasn't so consumed by my latest business adventure. 
I don't wanna hear about your job,Dennis. 
One word. Coffee. One 
problem. What do you get it? 
Anywhere,you get it anywhere. 
Wrong. You get it at my 
coffee vending machine. 
38 and 6th in the basement at K-mart. 
You just go downstairs. 
You get the key from David. 
 And boom,you plug into a machine. 
 You're done. 
But the point is I'm Dennis. And I'm a sex addict. 
And one of my steps towards recovery is atonement. 
Please,stop talking. 
Or my sex partner. 
I'm sorry that my disease has made you my victim of my sexual chrisma. 
I'm sorry that I've ruined you for other men. 
Apology accepted. Now 
get out of my apartment. 
You know,my sponsor said you were gonna try to pick a fight to lure me in and hit sex. 
It's not gonna work,Elizabeth. My 
support group is lousy with infos.

I am aware of it. 
I have a google news alert for the phrase "tracy jordan ridiculous disaster." 
Have you spoken to him? 
We're on the phone with his assistant Setting up a time for us to talk. 
Well,when do you expect him? 
I think he has stuff all morning. 
You think or you know? 
Hang on. I'm going into a tunnel. 
What is this? 
My mother sent me a box of old donaghy home movies. 
For your birthday? That's sweet. 
No,not really. 
This is the card that came with it. 
"jackie,here is some of your junk. 
"it was taking up the space "my new boyfriend needed for his golf bags. 
His name is paul and he doesn't want to meet you." 
 mm. 
 at any rate, I had jonathan convert the movies to dvd, Preserve these memories forever. 
Oh,my god.is that you? 
I like your little sweater vest. 
Oh! Hi-yo! 
 you threw up? 
 what? 
As a kid you never got so excited you vomited? 
No. No one does that. 
I mean,i've peed a little. 
Help me! 
His tie caught in the shredder! 
I'm lizzing! I'm lizzing! 
"lizzing" is a combination of laughing and whizzing. 
Uh,well if you want a good lizz,read this. 
 What is it? 
 A list i made in the fifth grade... 
Of the things i wanted to have done By the time i turned 50. 
Oh,my god. This is adorable. 
"go to disneyland. Ride in an airplane. 
Kiss peggy fleming." 
Done,done,and oh,boy. Done. 
"live in a house with stairs. 
"beat up a russian. 
Hit mom with a car." 
I wonder what that ten year old would think If he could see himself now. 
"fly on a plane." i've 
flown on air force one. 
"go to disneyland." 
Lemon,i've held walt disney's frozen head in my hands. 
That's awesome. 
I've danced with queen noor. 
I've hunted the world's most dangerous game. 
Man. 
Excuse me. Manatee. 
I once shot a manatee. 
Well,if that kid could see himself today, He would throw up. 
Thank you,lemon. 
There's only one left. 
"be friends with batman." 
There's still a couple of hours. 
Jonathan. 
Could you get adam west's agent on the phone please. 
Griswald talent management. 
Representing excellence. 
It's funny. 
I actually played peter pan on broadway. 
Did you know there's a broadway street in tampa? 
Now this is important. 
This needs to be threaded all the way up In order to lock. 
Otherwise you could fall. 
 in bed. 
 pay attention. 
Also,you can't have anything in your pockets. 
Oh,my phone. 
Will you hold that? Thanks. 
Ready. 
I'm flying! 
Oh,my god.why are there 
so many dead doves up here? 
Jenna's phone. 
Hey,jenna. This is dennis duffy. 
Yes,hello,this is jenna. 
I bet you never thought You'd be hearing from me again now,huh? 
Yes,really.why so ever 
would you be phoning me? 
With the help of webmd I was recently self-diagnosed as a sex addict. 
So former sex partner,i'm sorry that my disease Made you a victim of my sexual charisma. 
I'm sorry that i ruined you for other men. 
Look,i would've come down there and done this in person But it's complicated because of the whole liz thing you know. 
Naturally.liz. Always. 
If she found out about this she couldn't handle it. 
And it would ruin your friendship. 
You know,i was the love of liz's life. 
I'm not sure you were but apology accepted. 
Oh,no. i totally was. 
Peace. 
Forget it,tracy. 
Tracy,listen. You cannot go into space. 
Your contract expressly prohibits dangerous activities Like extreme sports or riding the subway on st. Patrick's day. 
What is this? Horseville? 
'Cause i am surrounded by naysayers! 
 wordplay. 
 that is solid. 
Look,when i was a kid growing up in the projects, I would look up at the stars And dream of going into space. Of escaping the slums. 
Of killing an ewok! 
Now the man that that kid has become Can make those dreams come true. 
Do you know what that's like? 
I do,tracy. 
Then you know why i have to do this. 
As robert browning once wrote, "oh,but a man's reach should exceed his grasp. 
Or what is a heaven for?" 
I was prepared for the possibility of this meeting. 
Tracy,i'll call up my friends at nasa And i'll set up a flight for you. 
Thank you,jackie d. 
Jack,what the hell? 
I'm not taking his childhood dream away from him. 
Not on my birthday. 
So you're just gonna let him do this? 
Of course not. 
I don't have friends at nasa. 
Bunch of nerds. 
You're gonna have to use your tv magic And fake a space launch for tracy. 
Aw,i was gonna go for a run today! 
Oh.ha ha. 
You missed a call. 
Was it my doctor/trainer? 
No,it was dennis. Dennis duffy. 
Calling me? Why? 
Well jenna,dennis has been going around Calling all the women he's ever had sex with. 
 did you speak to him? 
 yes. 
 did you pretend to be me? 
 i did. 
Did you do an impression of me? 
 of course. 
 was it british? 
 it was. 
 oh,my god,liz. 
First of all,the reason i have some english inflection In my speech is because i lost my virginity  to the my fair lady soundtrack.  jenna 
Second,you guys had broken up And dennis and i were in a very emotional place  because of hurricane katrina. 
 jenna,stop. 
Yes,what you did was disgusting. 
But how long have we known each other? 
15 years. 
We met at that car dealership audition in chicago. 
You were trying to be an actress then,  despite your neck  right. Yes. 
Well we have both seen this happen too many times. 
A strong female friendship torn apart by some guy. 
But that's not what's gonna happen this time. 
Dennis duffy said he didn't want this To hurt our friendship. 
As if someone like him ever could. 
Oh,thank you,liz. 
I mean,the idea that that guy is walking around Thinking he means anything to meto either of us It's ridiculous. 
It's unacceptable. 
We shouldn't let him get away with it. 
Are you thinking what i'm thinking? 
 yeah,let's stab him. 
 let's give him a piece of our mind. 
Yeah,your thing. 
More gifts,mr. Donaghy. 
Oh,you got a new tuxedo for your party. 
You know i wore nothing but hand-me-downs Until i was 12 years old. 
But i thought you were the oldest,sir. 
Oldest boy. 
 now look at me. 
 i already did. 
Wow. That's a lot of loot. 
My last birthday,i cleaned up. 
Look at this keychain i got. 
Every time you move his head,his head moves! 
Look! 
Kenneth,i wonder what it's like Seeing the world through your eyes. 
I don't know,mr. Donaghy. 
I think i see the world pretty much the same As everyone else. 
Really? 
* 'cause i think you're very special,kenneth * Pardon me. 
* to be able to get so much joy *  * from simple things *  * simple things * * simple * things. 
But most of us grow up And lose our sense of wonder. 
 oh,that's sad. 
 not really. No. 
I've surpassed my wildest dreams. 
I'm--i'm happier than i've ever been. 
Of course you are. 
You've got all these fancy presents From business associates And this big empty house to store them in. 
Happy birthday,mr. Donaghy. 
Hello,dummy. 
Hey. 
What's up? 
I know about you and jenna,dennis. 
Oh. 
I--i get why you're here. 
You want me to rank you. 
 apples and oranges,ladies. 
 no. Stop. Shut up. 
I'm here because i want you to know That i am not mad at jenna about this. 
Well,you can't be mad at me either,liz. 
I mean,i went to your apartment that night looking for you. 
To be with you. 
Wait a minute,hang on. My apartment? 
Okay,i can explain that. 
You had gone on that over 30 outward bound trip to arizona. 
And you had asked me to housesit. 
Well,dennis came over. 
And as i mentioned, We were both pretty torn up about hurricane katrina. 
What those people were doing to the superdome. 
Fine. All right. 
You know what,it happened. 
What do you want from me? 
This is what i want from you. 
I want you to understand exactly how unimportant you are. 
You are not the love of my life. 
You are not capable of hurting me. 
And you could never do anything to damage this friendship. 
It was in your bed. 
Aw,guys,come on! i eat in there. 
No,i'm gonna take the high road. 
So good luck with your fake addiction And your inconveniently-located vending machine. 
No,not okay,liz. 
Not okay. 
All right,fine. You know what? 
I'm ranking you now. 
Hey,blondie. You're number one. 
 thank you,dennis. 
 i don't care. 
You got it. 
Ladies and gentlemen,i can't stay long. 
I'm on a case.

The man of the hour.

Jack,am i the first one here? 
Ugh! i waited. This always happens. 
Lemon,what's inside that box? 
I don't know. A toy? 
Tonight was supposed to be special. 
And all i could think about was that kid. 
So happy,he threw up. 
The closest i came to vomiting tonight Was when i saw ann coulter's shoulder blades. 
What happens to us? 
We grow up. 
I have a good life, But i'll never be that happy again. 
I want that back. 
Well,there's nothing you can do about that. 
I disagree. 
I'm going to find out what was inside that box. 
I'm going to buy it with money. 
And it's going to make me happy. 
If that doesn't work, I'm going to benjamin button myself. 
We're not meeting in the middle. 
Oh,hey. 
I just wanted to get you to approve The other astronauts we hired. 
Looks good. Where's tracy? 
In cape canaveral. 
By which i mean through that door. 
We told him he had to be blindfolded before launch  to prevent space madness. 
 sure. 
And then we put him on the channel four Traffic copter for a couple hours. 
And now he's landed here in sunny florida. 
 well done,hornberger. 
 yeah. 
As a child,i dreamed of being a congressman Like my father. 
Now i do this. 
One dui in high school. 
At least it's dry heat here in florida. 
Good work astronaut jordan. 
Now do 20 space sit-ups. 
Computer,when do i get some tang? 
Also,i'm thirsty. 
Wordplay. 
Morning,jenna. 
Hey,you. 
God,telling dennis off together was so empowering. 
I felt so jacked up on the way home That i threw a brick through the window Of a banana republic. 
Yeah,it was something. 
I can't believe dennis tried to do that to us. 
But he got his,right? Sisterhood. 
Sure. Sisterhood! 
 oh.

Nothing. 
Ah! Ah! 
Be careful,'cause that thing is open. 
I'll go get the emergency floor marshall. 
Floor marshall! 
Hey,you called tech support? 
I need to see what's inside that box. 
If i learned anything from watching 24, You're gonna want to zoom in and enhance. 
Why don't you ask jimmy what's in there? 
It says "from jimmy" on it. 
Jimmy flaherty. 
Jimmy,what did you get me for my tenth birthday? 
Uh,i thought this was a job interview. 
I flew down from boston. 
I have to know,jimmy. 
I need to know what you got me that made that happy. 
I don't remember,jack. 
Doesn't this thing have any sound on it? 
You're clearly saying something. 
Jonathan,get me a deaf person. 
I was told this was a job interview. 
Tell me,wendy. What am i saying? 
You're saying, "apollo,apollo,apollo--" Oh,my god! You puked! 
Why wouldn't you warn me? 
I'm staring at your mouth!

Oh,what is that,sir? 
This is an apollo command and lunar module That i just paid $7,000 for at a vintage toy store Where a morbidly obese gentleman called me "pal." 
Whoa. 
Tracy to earth. Come in,earth! 
Mr. Jordan. 
How is space? 
Great wink,kenneth. 
Space is very cold but very beautiful. 
And sometimes it sounds like jenna yelling in the distance. 
I think i oh,my god. 
Where did you get that rocket? 
Mr. Donaghy's letting me hold it. 
It's awesome. 
You know,i actually envy you two. 
Sometimes i wish i could see the world Through your eyes instead of mine. 
Hey,jackie d. 
If everyone could see the world the way i see it, It would be a better place to live. 
I bet that's true,tracy. 
But that part of me is gone forever. 
I guess i just see the world the way i see it. 
Is he letting me keep this? 
I think so. 
I wish i was there so i could play with it. 
Hi,miss lemon. 
What do you want? 
I want to make it up to you,jenna. 
What can i do? 
How about on the next show you could do that song That they wouldn't let you sing at the inauguration? 
No. 
Chocolate rainbow is too good for tgs. 
You can tell them. 
You can tell the writers. 
Tell them what? 
About my commercial. 
The one i was in back in chicago. Ugh 
Everyone,listen to me. 
No,it's a real thing this time. 
When we were both living back in chicago And liz was still trying to be an actress, The only job she ever booke  was for a local phone sex line. 
 what? 
It was a chat line for urban singles. 
And they only hired her Because their first choice was deported. 
Okay,we're even. 
So you will not find it I found it. It's on youtube. 
What? 
No I have a cable to hook the computer up to the tv. 
Then shut your wet mouth and get that cable.

She cried all day.

Oh,lord! Oh,lord! Ah! 
Hey,are you feeling okay? 
I feel great. i feel like a kid. 
Lemon,i honestly don't know what i would do without you. 
I'll see you tomorrow,jack. 
See you tomorrow... Bijou. 
Ms.Lemon, here's the research you 
wanted for that white house skit. 
Oh,okay,thanks. 
You know it, lady broseph! 
 What! 
 Those are your new interns. 
Aren't they a little old, and over-dressed? 
They're all former investment bankers who were laid off after that economic crash that nancy pelosi caused. 
They've had zero real-world skills, but god, they work hard. 
Gentlemen, I need you to run out and pick up some flowers, A collection of bath soaps, and some spanish-language gossip magazines. 
Soap and spanish magazines? 
What,are you expecting a visit from the,uh um  Oh,lemon,don't start unless you've got something. 
 Okay. 
Elisa's grandmother's coming to visit. 
I don't think she likes me. 
******* ********* I don't understand it. 
Well,as long as elisa likes you, that's all that matters,right? 
Oh,no. I need concepcion on board. 
She's the matriarch of this family. 
And in puerto rico, elderly women are held in very high esteem. 
You should go there,lemon. 
They'd love you. 
None of this is mine. 
I live in 3-b, this is 13-b. 
You know what, i'm gonnsay it. 
Women should not deliver the mail. 
Dr. Andrew baird? Do you know this guy? 
I don't think so. 
Well,he's a pediatrician, so you know he likes kids. 
Or feet. No,no,kids. 
He has a bill from a divorce lawyer, so you know he's single. 
And he has a golf magazine,so you know he's not gay or poor. 
Jenna,come on. 
Now let's see what kind of movies he likes. 
What are you doing? 
That's a federal offense. 
And you already have two strikes. 
I do not support this! 
Muppets take manhattan. 
Caddyshack. 
And a documentary about how pies are made. 
Hello,dr. Baird. 
Wasn't that a treat? 
Only the special tours get to see conan without his wig. 
Mi programa esta empezando ahora. 
Oh,i'm sorr but her show's on now. 
Do you think we could uh,yes,yes.Jonathan,would you 
come and help mrs. Padriera? 
I think your grandmother hates me. 
I don't understand. 
She's usually a very loving person. 
 Is it because i'm white? 
 No. 
I've had white boyfriends. Black,cuban... 
 Brazilian guys with german heritage-- - I get it. 
You've been with other men. Congratulations. 
 Thank you. 
 What is she watching? 
Los amantes clandestinos. 
It's a mexicantelenovela. 
But who is that? 
That isel generalissimo. He's 
the villain of los amantes. 
Pa! 
The name of the actor is hector moreda. 
Dime donde estan los diamantes. 
Nunca! 
Dime. 
He looks exactly like me. 
He does look like you.

Don't be weird-looking, don't be weird-looking. 
Ah,girl! 
Oh,god! 
Dr. Baird,tre's someone at your door. 
Oh,thanks,oswald. 
Oswald was just helping me hang some pictures. 
I live in the basement, so I have all the nails. 
I'm drew. Sorry I smell like 
frosting. I just love to bake. 
I want to go to there. 
So will I see you before saturday? 
Jack,about this weekend... 
I don't think you should come to my cousin's police academy graduation, or my other cousin's parole party. 
Boy,i hope those two n' rtoc k eventually have a showdown that pits family against justice. 
Hang on,you mean you don't want me to come? 
It's not me. 
Abuelathought it should just be family. 
Is this about the generalissimo? 
Jack. 
As a child,my grandmother worked in a silver mine without proper ventilation. 
Now her mi is squishy like a hacky sack. 
But no matter what, she's still myabuelita. 
Even though sometimes she comes at me with a knife because of a silver frenzy. 
I'll call you tomorrow,okay? 
Okay,good night, querida. 
Generalissimo. 
Look at dr. Baird. How did 
you get a picture of him? 
I told him his haircut was exactly what i've been trying to describe to my barber. 
Yeah,smooth,i know. I'm 
way out of my league here. 
Okay,don't get intimidad. 
You know he can't be perfect. 
No,he might be. 
I got some more of his mail. 
And I opened it. 
Uh-huh,yeah, i'm the worst. 
It just proves that I don't deserve this guy. 
He went to medical school at columbia, all kinds of charity baloney. 
He gets l of the movie channels, including starz. 
And he trains seeing eye dogs at home. 
Oh,well, that's no good for you. You're allergic to dogs. 
 I guess i'll have to step in then. 
 Shut up. Just let me think! 
Please keep your voices down. 
Mr. Jordan is a little hung over. 
He pulled an uncle harland parcell last night. 
Minus the wistful jug blowing. 
I went out with the interns. 
Those white boys are not kidding around. 
Have you ever tasted scotch? 
It's terrible! 
And this thing they call "box seats at the rangers game," it's so cold! 
And what is rohypnol? 
Tracy,those are roofies! 
So I shouldn't have taken two of them for my headache? 
There he is! 
Tonight,shooters at blockheads, lay a base, at meet up with my bro-hams at the cornell club? 
Hey,you know it,bri-man! A'ight! 
I have no idea what either one of us just said. 
He thinks you're going out again. 
You gotta tell him you can't. 
I have a rep to maintain. 
If I can't keep up with a bunch of wall street frat boys Uh-oh, here come the roofies. 
You can do whatever you want to me. 
Uno,dos  you wanted to see me? 
 Lemon,this is elisa. 
What? Come on,you're a nurse? 
Yeah,some of us are hot. 
Lemon,we have a problem... With him. 
Boy,that guys looks a lot like you. 
Precisely. 
Two hours a day, five days a week, hector moreda And the generalissimo are poisoning elisa's grandmother against me. 
Oh,he just blew up that kid! 
Elisa and I have enough obstacles. 
Our work schedules, our cultures, her adorably broken english. 
Metrocards are a real thing,jack. 
You use them on the subway. 
Anyway,this morning, telemundo, which is owned by sheinhardt-universal,  purchasedlos amantes,uh-- - Clandestinos. 
And now,i own it. 
Isn't that romantic? 
Now,all I have to do is kill off the generalissimo, and clear a path to elisa'sabuela. 
Lemon,the director needs a script by this afternoon, and elisa here will help you with the spanish. 
No,no,no, don't drag me into this. I have my own problems. 
And i've never even watched that show. 
All you need to know is thatel geralissimo is pure evil, look at him. 
He stole that girl's love letters and opened them. 
Opened her mail? That is 
just shocking. He's a monster. 
Or he has a really good reason to do it. 
Oh,no, his only reason was to trick her into giving up her honor to him. 
Uh-huh,and how did he use her mail to do that,exactly? 
He read her most intimate secrets, and turned himself into that which she desired. 
What she loved, he pretended to love too, until it was too late. 
My dog ran away! 
Oh,my god. Let me get my coat. 
 Buster. 
 Buster! 
 Come here,boy!Buster! 
 If see the dog,give us a shout.Thank you. 
The funny thing is this is what I love about him. 
Don'worry,liz. We're gonna find him. 
If we don't, I don't think I could ever be around dogs again. 
You know, i'm actually on the board of the pediatric restless leg syndrome association. 
Oh,i forgot I even had this on. 
I have so many charity t-shirts. 
We have so much in common. 
Well,buster's probably dead. 
Do you want to go to the wine bar around the corner, deal with these emotions, get some dinner? 
Uh,i would love to, liz,i really would. 
But,i just got divorced not that long ago. 
I'm really not ready for this kind of thingust yet. 
Plus,i have not given up on that dog. He's a fighter. 
Buster! 
Yeah,buster! 
Shoot it,dog! 
I'm going to! I'm tracy jordan. 
Why would I be afraid of fire next to my mouth? 
Drink,drink,drink! 
 Is she watching? 
 Yes. 
I told her it was a very special episode. 
Good-bye,general. 
Esto es por mi padre! 
Fallaste! 
Wait,wait,wait. What did he just 
say? That wasn't in the script. 
He said "you missed." 
Fallaste otra vez! 
He said "you missed again." 
Y ahora,esta pocion me dejara vir por siempre! 
"and now,this potion's gonna make me live forever." 
What's happening,jack? 
El generalissimo was supposed to die! 
Morena has gone broken arrow. Jonathan! 
We really should have had somebody on the set who speaks spanish. 
I'll call you back. 
Moreda. 
Moreda! 
Welcome,jack. 
Cigar,brandy? 
What happened,hector? 
 The general was supposed to die. 
 Ay. 
Do n t ry to out-generalissimo me,my friend. 
This role has made me rich, famous and respected. 
I get to cut the line at disneyland, if I come mid-week. 
I have a lucrative endorsement deal with sabor de soledad! 
Ahora con mas semen del toro. 
I am not going to let you ke all that away from me. 
I know where you came from,hector. 
Play ball,or you'll be back doing r-rated hypnotism at the bull fights so fast, you won't know what hit you. 
You come over here and say that to my face. 
 No,you come over here. 
 Nunca! 
If you refuse to be reasonable, I must call the presidente of telemundo. 
La oficina de jack donaghy. 
Hola? 
Well-played,jack. 
I see that we are not so different,you and i. 
 We laugh alike. 
 We think ali. 
At times,we even drink alike. 
You can lose your mind. 
Look,you should know, i'm doing this for a woman. 
This woman. 
Wow,i am super gay, and I would totally switch for her. 
She's amazing. 
But her grandmother hates me, because she hates the generalissimo, so he's gotta go. 
El generalissimo does not have to die to clear the way to theabuela. 
Not if theabuela comes to love him. 
But that's impossible. 
Seduction ner impossible forel generalissimo. 
I will become everything that old hispanic women desire. 
I will make her love me. 
You really think you can pull that off? 
It will be the performance of a lifetime. 
Like julie harris inthe belle of amherst. 
Wow,you are surprisingly gay. 
Okay,so? 
So did you ever find buster? 
What did youerstan that picture is from a dog food ad. 
Hi,lemon. Here's today's script. 
I translated it,and took out thestar warsreferences. 
Are you an actress? 
No,i'm a nurse. 
Oh,good. 
Don't listen to anyone who says you should become an actress. 
Okay. 
Uh,i also cut the scene between the general and tia maria. 
They cannot be together. 
Not after what he did to maria's daughter. 
Why? What did he do? 
Oh,it was despicable. 
Even worse than his misuse of the mails. 
The generalissimo tricked her to the villa by inviting her to a fancy party. 
But when she got there, it was just the two of them. 
He drugged her champagne and had his way with her. 
Later,she gave birth to the devil. You know,sweeps week. 
That's what I could do to drew. 
Drug him? Liz,no. 
Having been on both sides of that, I could tell you it's not a good idea. 
No,i'm going to tell drew that i'm having a little "wcome to the building" party for him, but there is no party. 
And then,when he shows up, i'll laugh and say "oh,it's the wrong night." 
And then he'll laugh, and say "oh,well, one glass couldn't hurt." 
And then I will put my mouth on his mouth. 
No,lemon, do not do this. 
The trickery, the deceit is a slippery slope. 
Yeah,but you haven't seen dr. 
Baird. He lks like a cartoon pilot. 
Be very careful. 
El generalissimo was once a good man. 
But the years of loneliness drove him insane. 
I am not the generalissimo, elisa. 
Mr. Jordan, I called my clharland, 
and I got his hangover cure. 
"mix two cups boiled possum meat with one messload ragweed, stir in alcohol-- " Ken. These interns are wearing me out. 
It's like I said in my not-hit comedy cruise boat, "i'm gettin' too old for this ship." 
Well,you are getting older,sir. 
There's no reason you have to keep acting like you're 20. 
Yes,there is. 
Do you know what happens to a comedian when he gets old and loses his audience? 
He starts to get offered serious roles. 
And do you really want to see me play arthur ashe? 
,that would be terrible. 
You leave him alone! 
Exactly. 
So if i'm gonna keep my hilarious reputation, these interns gotta go! 
But where?They don't 
know how to do anything, and there are no jobs left on wall street. 
Then i'll find something for them to do. 
Drew. 
Oh,uh, am I the first one here? 
What? 
No,the party's tomorrow night. 
Tonight, i'm just hanging out, eating fondue by candlelight. 
Bucome in, I was just opening a bottle of wine to drink alone. 
Okay,i guess one glass couldn't hurt. 
 I found your dog! 
 What? 
He lost his collar, but I recognize him from the poster. 
That's not possible. 
Of course it's possible. 
How could he not want to come back to this beautiful lady? 
My dog is back! 
I'll open the wine. 
Just put him down. 
********* ******* ********** ********** ********** ******* ************** Oh,muy dulce. 
Si,si,si. 
************* ************* Oh,you need more. 
Buster,you wang! 
Let's get you back in your special kitchen cabinet. 
Man,that dog is giving me a headache. 
I have some aspirin in my white bag there if you need any. 
Everything okay in there? 
Yeah,it's okay, he's just playing along. 
Or he bites me. 
Alone at last. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah,i'm,uh you've been roofied! 
You did what? 
No,no,not me. The pills! 
Is this my mail? 
Okay,no, you're not thinking clearly. 
Why is it all open? 
That's not your dog. 
I can explain. Just relax. 
Help! 
I am the generalissimo! 
I don't know what that means. 
Abuelamade you breaded calf's brains. 
Muchas gracias. 
She really liked the chgeyou made inlos amantes clandestinos. 
She's very proud that I am dating such an important television man. 
Oh,well What are you going to do about the nbc news? 
It's too sad. 
I'll look into it, uh,abuela. 
Hi,liz. 
Again,i am so sorry about everhing I actually got some of your mail. 
Oh,okay. Hope you didn't open it. 
I did. Live at the 
hollywood bowl. Classic. 
Membership in the cheese of the month club, And the steak of the month club, and a copy ofvegetarian times. 
I'm a ip-flopper. 
Also a response to your complaint about bad grammar in subway ads. 
The word "whom" deserves a defender. 
I'm just saying that based on your mail, I actually would have wanted to meet this elizabeth lemon in 3-b. 
Really? 
Do you want to try this again? 
I know that I lied to you, and I accidentally roofied you, But weirder things have happened,right? 
Isn't that tracy jordan? 
The lehman brothers investment bank will reopen under the direction of comedian tracy jordan. 
I'm doing this so no one will know i'm getting old. 
But you just told us you're old. 
This interview is over. 
Yeah,i guess weirder things have happened. 
And now to lighten things up, some pictures of beautiful latin babies, and the music of tito puente. 
Jackthis is ridiculous. 
Okay,it's a date. 
Okay.
