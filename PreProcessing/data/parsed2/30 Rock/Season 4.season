Good show tonight, mr. Jordan. 
Hey, kenneth, why aren't your teeth glowing In the black light? 
You'll have to ask the fella who whittled 'em for me. 
It's her, isn't it? 
I don't kiss and tell, jack. 
Ahh, because you're a gentleman, danny. 
It's good to finally have another one of us around here. 
I'm just happy to be here. 
A month ago I was doing a robot act on the street, So I know my place. 
I want to be tgs' steve nash. 
Come down from canada, work hard, Make the black guy look good. 
Did you just make a sports reference? 
You know how little of that I get here? 
Look at me in the black light. 
It's tron. 
Watch out, sark. It's me, flynn. 
 light bike. 
Good job tonight, danny. 
Robot lorenzo lamas was funny. 
As was robot ryan seacrest and david hasselbot. 
Hey, it's the writing. 
It's really not. 
So now that danny's here, You actually come to the after-parties? 
It's nice to have another man around for once. 
Oh, there are other men Oh, boy. 
It's not what you think! 
It's something I need to wear to support my breasts! 
Lemon, I have season tickets to every sports team In new york. 
So close to the action, you'll feel Like you're sitting in front of an hd television And they're wasted on you and your co-workers. 
Why won't they put me on the jumbotron? 
I've been doing cool stuff all game. 
Whoo! 
But my biggest problem with quiddich is, If the snitch is 150 points, Why does anyone bother with the quaffle? 
Hey, jeter! Are you jealous? 
I'm with my new boyfriend! 
But now that danny's here, I have someone to do guy stuff with. 
Have actual male conversations. 
You know, he confided in me he's got a little something Going with one of the girls here. 
Maybe it's that russian dancer with the tattoos, Which is the crazy sex trifecta. 
That girl has a name, jack. 
We call her "skankovitch." 
I'm sure you disapprove. 
But the workplace has a hierarchy, And danny is a star. 
All the pretty little things down here Always want to be with the people up here. 
Whatever. 
As long as he's discreet about it. 
It's a younger man's game, lemon. 
But I can't say that I don't miss it. 
You'd be in your office late at night. 
The new girl would come in with some flimsy excuse To be there. 
 "oh, mr. Donaghy. 
I forgot to give you the factory worker death rates." 
Then she'd laugh at your lame joke. 
A touch on the arm... 
And you take your reward. 
You take your reward. 
How drunk are you? 
A lot to very. 
Boy, that robot body paint does not wash off. 
Is it the body paint or is danny just glowing Like a beacon of manly camaraderie? 
Oh, god. 
I'm extremely drunk. 
Oh, my. 
Hey. 
We got to get danny out by 5:00 today. 
I guess jack's taking him to the knicks game. 
Liz, I can't do girls' lunch today. 
We've never done that. 
i>- Because I have an audition for gossip girl. 
Oh, I love that show. 
I play tartine gramercy, An heiress to a vermouth fortune And a freshman at nyu. 
Really? A college freshman? 
That's right. In this scene they gave me, 
I'm fighting with my mother, A washed-up actress who's clinging To her last scraps of faded glamour. 
 Uh huh. 
It's interesting that they highlighted the mother's lines. 
Well, that's so I'll know what part not to read. 
As if the word "mother" didn't tip me off already. 
Wish me luck. 
We really should have said something. 
What happens when she gets there And finds out she's the mom? 
Oh, pete, that's later. 
Maybe we'll be dead by then. 
Oh, that'd be great. 
Sue, you're probably wondering why we asked you To join the entourage. 
Well, over the years, I've had a complicated relationship With women, from my treatment of the dancers here To my remarks about madeleine albright At the 1996 white house correspondents' dinner. 
What? It's true. 
She does look like one of those. 
Now that mr. Jordan's having a daughter, 
He wants to learn to give all women The respect they deserve. 
Even you foreigners. 
That's why I'm adding a daughter To the entourage family. 
Now what's on the schedule for today? 
"10:00 a.M. Dotcom shows up pictures 
From his trip to greece." 
I think I'm gonna go ahead and cancel that. 
Okay, I'll reschedule... Again. 
"11:00 a.M. Go to strip club." 
I'll get the car. 
Hang on! No. 
I don't think we should go to a strip club. 
It just doesn't feel right. 
I think we should let the new member Choose an activity. 
 I like to go to tasti dlite. 
I said we're not going to a strip club. 
Pinkberry? 
What don't you understand? 
I don't want to take you to a strip club. 
Oh, come on, you hoser! 
Hoser! 
So what did you do after the party the other night? 
Well, my work friend and I went to her office. 
Ooh, she has an office. 
Hey, is it that chick lawyer who does The sexual harassment presentation? 
Because she's asking for it. 
Okay, no more guesses. Continue. 
All right, so we're getting into it, And she takes off her glasses. 
Real sexy. - Nice. 
But she never takes off her shoes, Which I kind of like. 
Even though the reason is She's never let a man see her feet. 
What? 
And she's kind of a tease. 
Mostly we just kiss and then she makes me Go down to the deli to get her a sandwich. 
So we haven't gone too far, but under that dress, I can tell she's wearing some weird underwear. 
I want to see it. 
They're called spanx. 
 Hello. 
 Jenna, thanks so much For coming in. 
This is archeria. 
She'll be reading with you. - Hi. 
Okay, tartine has just discovered Videos of her boyfriend on her mother's online sex diary. 
Both: "mother, is there something I don't know About you and wainwright?" 
What are you doing? 
Sorry. Let's start over. 
Both: "mother, is there something I don't Jenna, you're reading the wrong lines. 
What do you mean? 
I'm not playing the mo You wanted to see me? 
Close the door, lemon. 
So we haven't talked about your personal life lately. 
Anything new going on there? 
No. Same old nothing. 
Nothing? Really? 
That's too bad. 
'cause you know what I always say, Black light attack! 
What? 
Oh, boy. 
That stuff does not wash off. 
You and danny? 
I would have guessed anyone else. 
Jenna, sue All right, come on. 
How is this possible? 
Well, I don't know if you know this, jack, But the workplace is a hierarchy, And I am danny's boss. 
Sometimes all the...  
Pretty little things down here want to be With the people up here. 
And they come into your office late one night With some flimsy excuse. 
 hey, liz. 
I just want to show you this new iphone app. 
You shake it and it sounds like an empty can. 
Huh? -  
My favorite apps are the ones before my entree. 
Oh, my god. 
That is the funniest thing I've ever heard. 
So what are you up to right now? 
And I took my reward. 
Lemon, you need to end this now. 
What? No. 
Jack, you were just talking about How you miss office hook-ups. 
That is a double standard. 
 Calm down. 
 I won't calm down. 
Women are allowed to get angrier than men About double standards. 
It's not about that. 
Yes, I've had office relationships in the past, But always with people that I could transfer To another city or introduce to nicolas sarkozy. 
Danny is on your show. 
Yeah, but it's not serious. 
It's not serious yet. 
End it before it starts affecting the show. 
 fine. 
I'll talk to him when he gets in. 
What did he do to the back of your knees? 
A lady never tells. 
Hey, buddy, you like italian ice? 
Hey, watch your mouth! 
She's only 34 years old! 
K? 
What's wrong with me? 
First, I don't want to go to strip clubs, And then I get angry at the hilarious dude That says something awesome. 
There's nothing wrong with you, sir. 
It's just you're treating sue like family now. 
That makes you feel protective of her. 
But I'm not like that with my sons. 
When they were little, I threw them In the deep end of our pool to help them Get over their fear of sharks. 
Well, it's different with girls. 
You want to protect them from the world. 
I'm proud of you, sir. 
It's like a whole new part of your heart has opened up. 
Thank god, 'cause the doctors keep telling me It's pretty clogged. 
The mother. 
They wanted me to play the...Mother. 
Oh, boy. Okay, here we go. 
Pete! Jenna just got the 
A mother? 
I'm not a mother. 
Would a mother be planning a sex tour Of vietnam this spring? 
Just--just come on. 
Look, you're a beautiful woman, But you can't play prom queens and murdered runaways forever. 
But those were my majors at the royal tampa academy Of dramatic tricks. 
You can try to fight getting older. 
You can be like madonna and cling to youth With your gollum arms or you can be Like meryl streep and embrace your age with elegance. 
So you're saying it's a choice Between the dignity of middle age And the illusion of youth. 
Two paths. 
Meryl streep or madonna. 
Very well. 
I will emulate my acting inspiration. 
A woman of profound poise whose career Is what we all aspire to. 
 Okay, this buildup is making me nervous. 
A woman whose feminine grace and normal outfits Are an inspiration. 
Just say who it is and I'll feel better. 
Someone whose very name stands For enduring beauty and the wonder of womanhood. 
 Please don't say  madonna! 
Hey, danny. 
Hey, liz. 
Look, I know we're supposed to pretape That robot v. Wade cold open tonight, 
But jack said I can skip it and go To the rangers game with him. 
Yeah, sure, you can go, But, um, we have to talk. 
Okay. 
Richard, would you excuse us please? 
What's up? 
Meet me in my office in five minutes. 
Well, just let me change. 
Ah! Mmm, no. That won't be necessary... 
Officer. 
What are you happy about? 
 did we get canceled? 
Can't a girl just be happy? 
Oh, no. Jenna, don't do this. 
Hang on. 
I'm just tweeting that I ran into you. 
This is so tandem. 
"random," jenna. 
Those kids are saying the word "random." 
Ow! Come on, you guys! Stop it! 
Turn it off, frank. -  
What's going on? 
What are you doing to cerie? 
 Frank downloaded this highpitched tone That can only be heard by young ears. 
They use it in japan to keep kids From loitering outside of convenience stores. 
Cerie's the only one that can hear it. 
The rest of us are too old. 
Oh! Not me! 
I can hear it! 
Oh! My ears are, like, dying. 
Ahh! Facebook! 
Um, I already turned it off. 
I also have this low-frequency tone That can only be heard by people over 40. 
Have you started playing it yet? 
Ah! 
Lemon, can I speak with you for a moment? 
What is happening to me? 
Danny and I were supposed to have lunch today. 
Why didn't he show up? - I don't know. 
Maybe he had something better to do. 
Well, I had a porterhouse for two alone. 
I am very angry and sleepy. 
This is from danny's chips costume. 
What is it doing here? 
Officer, what's going on up there? 
It's an accident. 
A really bad one. 
   mmm. 
This badge is a symbol of dignity, honor, And dramatized 1970s inter-ethnic california Daytime motorcycle highway justice. 
I'm sorry, jack. I changed my mind. 
I'm trying to look out for the show here, lemon. 
Yeah, I don't think you are. 
While stuck in a pile-up On the pacific coast highway earlier, I realized something. 
You take danny away from work Whenever you want to hang out. 
I don't think this is about the show. 
I think you have some sort of problem With the fact that danny is with me. 
For four years I've had to make do With what passes for men in this place. 
With their untucked shirts, boneless faces, Their stars, both wars and trek. 
I needed a man around here and I finally have one. 
i>- No, I finally have one. 
Liz lemon has a handsome, goof-around, Make-out buddy. 
And that's the problem. 
Danny can't be my alpha-male wingman And his boss'... 
Little scrump nugget. 
They're incompatible. 
Well, then I guess it's on. 
May the best man win. 
Oh, he will. 
Where you going? 
It's board game night. 
 Out. 
 Out with whom? 
This guy doug. 
Well, does doug have a last name? 
Okay, everybody. Let's just 
You can't make me stay here! 
You are a part of this entourage. 
I didn't ask to be in this entourage! 
Look! I know you didn't mean that. 
I do mean it. I'm not like you! 
I'll never be like you! 
And now I'm at the point where I love just kissing. 
We kiss for an hour, and it's totally enough for me. 
 Uh huh. 
This is good guy talk. 
She has really thin lips, but she makes up For it with tongue girth. 
Okay, maybe we just watch the game, Forget about girls for a night. 
Yeah!  
Whoo! 
You know, my little cuddlebaby Loves to watch figure skating, And I'm really starting to get into that. 
And now turning to women's health. 
Our latest information on women's sexuality finds Female libido does tend to peak In those years just before perimenopause In what scientists and doctors like myself Are calling their dirty 30s. 
Women are also looking at the latest I got to go, jack. 
What? 
You're leaving? 
It's only zero-zero. 
I'll talk to you in the morning. 
Liz lemon. 
That was a low blow last night, lemon. 
What can I say, jack? 
I guess I'm getting a second wind here At the tail end of my dirty 30s. 
Lord, this whole week has been such a bummer. 
Hey, when did we add this grizzly adams sketch? 
I wrote it last night...Late. 
The shirt should be... Filthier. 
If you were a man, you would have to register Yourself as a sex criminal. 
I'm taking danny back. 
Oh, good luck with that. 
Remember, if it doesn't work out, There's always lutz. 
* forever young * * I want to be * * forever young * Jenna, stop it! 
Ow. 
Look, you claimed that you want to be happy, But that's never gonna happen Until you are honest about who you are. 
That's easy for you to say. 
I've built my career on a certain image And you have no idea what I go through to maintain it. 
The workouts, the lotions, pretending I wasn't Fourth runner-up at the miss teen bicentennial pageant. 
Ooh, that's And you don't understand the fear I live with. 
The fear of people ever seeing the real me. 
Yes, I do. 
We all have secrets. 
You know that I have something I've been hiding From the world for 20 years. 
What are you talking about? 
If you come out as your real age, I will reveal my friend tom. 
You would do that for me? 
How long would it take? 
Well, if I do nothing, He'll be here within 48 hours. 
Ow. 
Good morning, li Oh...My...God. 
I'd like you all to meet tom. 
Tom selleck. 
He's my moustache. 
Thank you, liz. 
It's funny. 
All my "a-ha" moments end with a moustache pressed against me. 
There you are! 
Kenneth and I were worried sick about you. 
I think doug put something in my drink and I don't remember That's not important anymore. 
I want to talk to you about our fight the other night. 
Look, having a girl in your life is different. 
You want to protect her, and the best that you can hope for Is that someday a nice man will come And take her from you. 
That's it. 
Hey, sue, I need you in the writer's room. 
 I knew this day would come. 
I just didn't think it would be so soon. 
You take good care of her. 
* forever young * * I want to be forever young * * do you really want to live forever * * forever * * and ever * * forever young * * I want to be forever young * I don't know if I can go through this With a real daughter. 
Yes, you can. 
I know that was hard, but I bet You wouldn't give up this week With miss laroche vanderhoot for anything. 
No, I wouldn't. 
Not for a billion doll hairs. 
I'm sorry. Did you say "doll hairs"? 
Yeah, they're not worth nothing. 
You could probably sell 'em to a doll company And get maybe 40 grand for 'em. 
Danny. 
Danny, I know. 
I know liz is your secret work girlfriend. 
I wanted to tell you, but she thought We should be discreet. 
I mean, we're just having fun. 
I know. 
You need to end it now. 
What? Why? 
I never told anyone this. 
And that's why if you ask people about it, They won't know what you're talking about, Because it's a secret, not because it's a lie. 
 Okay, I understand. 
 Good. 
Now here's my secret. 
My secret is... 
I'm in love with liz lemon. 
What? 
It's true. 
It was love at first sight. 
I ache for her sexually. 
How could I not? 
I'm entranced by those mud-colored eyes, Set back in...That skin. 
And her laugh. 
Her walk. 
That splay-footed walk. 
And that... 
Whole situation right there. 
And Oh. 
Moustache? 
Good god, lemon. 
Jack, I had no idea. 
I mean, the last thing I want to do is screw up our friendship. 
Me and liz, I'll end it today. 
You'd do that for me? 
 Mmm! 
 Whoa! 
Yeah, I think I'll be okay. 
Oh, mother. 
I can't believe you're dying of old age. 
Don't cry for me, tartine. 
I've had a full life. 
Oh, the things I've seen. 
The first clinton administration. 
The nagano olympics. 
Microsoft windows '95. 
But I'm 41 now. 
Time to die. 
And cut! 
So danny says that he and I can't hook up anymore. 
And I am taking him to the fight At the garden tomorrow night. 
I guess the best man won. 
 Uh huh. 
Well, the reason that he gave me was that Someone else here is in love with me. 
It was my only move, lemon, and it was hard, believe me. 
What did you say you loved about me? 
Did you talk about my body? 
Did you say how you like to watch me dance? 
Yeah. You like that? 
You're embarrassing yourself, lemon. 
 Mmhmm. It started out as a joke, 
But it's becoming real. 
I don't care! 
I'm having a good time! 
Hey! 
Did you know that everybody here Went out last night without us? 
Oh, nerds! 
Nerds? 
Nerds. 
Yeah, Thursday night thunder. 
That's been going on for years. 
You know about it? How come 
I've never been invited? 
Don't you think th's a little bit rude? 
Well, I yelled "baba booey" At Walter Cronkite's funeral, So I actually have no idea of what's rude or not. 
 Yeah, well, let me...  
 But I couldn't thunder last night, Because I had to take Angie to the ER. 
She had some complications with her pregnancy, So that kind of trumps your little problem. 
Ah, yeah, you're right. 
How is she? 
Well, she's fine, and the baby's fine, But they put her on bed rest Till her blood pressure goes down. 
Well, listen, tray, if there's anything I can do, Please let me know. 
There's one thing. 
Could you take care of Angie like a husband Until this whole ass-ache blows over? 
Absolutely not. 
What about you, k? 
I'm on it, sir! 
Oh, my. 
I haven't seen your brow that furrowed Since you saw that picture of Helen mirren in a bikini. 
How is it possible? 
Is she a wizard? 
A question for another time, Lemon. 
I was with Avery last night, And I almost had a Nancy-related incident. 
Oh, Jack. 
Oh, Nan... 
Na. 
What? 
I was saying, "oh, Nana." 
Have I not told you about my grandmother fetish? 
Avery actually tried to get on board. 
Later that night, She put some mothballs behind her ears And fed me peppermints. 
She is in it to win it. 
This can't go on. 
I'm making a decision about Nancy and Avery today. 
I'm going in the bunker. 
No distractions. 
I had Jonathan remove the bar And my collection of 18th century french erotica. 
I've had to make some tough calls over the years, Switching sheinhardt's wig production To 100% chinese cadaver hair, Turning down Dick Cheney's offer to become king of Iraq, Selecting the brand-new logo for NBC. 
 it's fresh. 
But this Nancy-Avery thing Is the toughest decision I've ever had to make. 
Well, I'm glad you're taking it seriously. 
Although, sometimes when you try so hard to find love, You can't see that it's been standing in front of you The whole time. 
Oh, good God. 
What did you come in here for? 
Last night, I saw my entire staff out at a bar. 
They go out every week and I'm never invited. 
Do they not even like me? 
Oh, don't worry. 
It's healthy. 
Bosses need to keep their distance From their subordinates. 
Mr. Donaghy, I have to 
run out to Mr. Jordan's house. 
I'll call you when I get there so you know I'm safe. 
No! I don't care 
if you're safe! 
I love you! 
After four years, I thought I was close with these people. 
I thought we were a family. 
Don't say family. 
Then I see them out at a bar without me, Giving each other windmill high-fives? 
Like in top gun. 
But this is your staff. 
You can't let it bother you. 
You could always come up here and have a drink with me, A fellow manager. 
Oh, great, that sounds really fun. 
I'll just pour myself a drink. 
Oh, I dropped my glass! 
Is that supposed to be a broom? 
Anchor the handle. 
Yeah. 
There it is. 
This better be important. 
I'm in a meeting. 
Mr. Jordan, 
The situation here has deteriorated. 
Great update, Ken. 
Thanks for checking in. 
Talk to you later. 
Actually, sir, I think you should come home. 
*** If she sees me again. 
She wants you to come help her. 
What? But why? 
You're much better at that serving stuff than I am. 
Well, your wife thinks Taking care of her should be your job And I have to agree, sir. 
You made a promise to care for her In sickness and in health. 
Don't you remember your wedding vows? 
To be honest, I couldn't really understand anything Rick James was saying. 
Come home, Mr. Jordan. 
Mrs. Jordan needs you. 
Fine, I'll be there soon. 
And if you get hungry, You can help yourself to anything in the fridge, And once I'm there, I'll determine how much to charge you. 
Hey, buddies. 
Anybody do anything fun last night? 
What about you, Frank? 
What did you do? 
I, uh, had a... 
Doctor's appointment. 
Oh, really? 
For what? 
Oh, uh... 
Oh, God, it looks like the underside of an octopus! 
Hey, Liz, can I talk to you and Jenna in... 
The office where everyone clips their toenails? 
Not cool, guys. 
As you guys know, I'm getting married on may 22nd. 
You are? Still? 
Well, it was off for a while, Because my fiance was on his dad's yacht And got captured by pirates, But now, thanks to the a-team, he's back. 
Sure. 
He has a different energy now. 
He's quieter. 
But we're getting married. 
And are we still in the wedding? 
Of course. 
The bridesmaids are you guys, Andy roddick's wife, My dutch cousins, And Penelope cruz's hotter sister Monica. 
You're gonna be so out of place, Liz. 
Anyway, my mom said that if you guys Are gonna throw me a work party, It has to be this week. 
 Oh, no! Really? 
 Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. 
It's just that the schedule's really filling up Now that aris is finally getting over His Stockholm syndrome. 
Oh, that reminds me. 
You guys may have to walk down the aisle With some pirates. 
It's just, I don't think I can plan a party this week. 
I'm doing a juice fast, And it's making me really grouchy. 
Aah! 
You know what? 
This is perfect. 
I'll have that party... 
Tonight, And it'll be fun, And you'll all see that I'm fun. 
So screw both of you! 
And screw everybody out here! 
Liz Lemon is having a party! 
 * and they're ain't no party * * like a Liz Lemon party * * 'cause a Liz Lemon party is mandatory * All right, Donaghy, Follow your heart. 
"hard equations and rational thinking." 
Damn you, heart. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
There's a minor janitor problem. 
I apologize for letting a kashmiri Into your office. 
I just need five minutes of your time, Mr. Donaghy. 
Now would be a good time, actually, To handle the janitor situation. 
 But, sir, what about...  
 I always say bosses should stay Deeply involved with their subordinates. 
Does this mean you're coming to my cabaret? 
Jonathan, close the door. 
Please. 
So what can I do for you? 
It has been a week, And I've heard nothing from you, sir. 
Have you forgotten our agreement About me taking over 11:30? 
I'm sorry. What? 
Five years ago, I threatened to quit Unless you got me out of the late night shift. 
Wow, other than some notable recent exceptions, Nbc never guarantees employment terms Five years in advance. 
I have a contract. 
That is my signature. 
You signed it on April 22, 2005. 
Okay, in my defense, every April 22nd, I honor Richard Nixon's death by getting drunk And making some unpopular decisions. 
Well, I want the earlier shift. 
It's better pay and more prestigious. 
Ever since I am a little boy, I am dreaming of hosing the tonight shift. 
Okay. Uh, calm down, 
Uh, Khonani. 
I understand that I made you a promise, And we're going to keep it, because this is NBC... 
the biggest loser network. 
So you'll fix this? 
Today? 
Well, this is a janitor emergency, And I really have no choice But to make it my number one priority. 
Good. Thank you. 
Can I have those pictures For a special book the janitors keep? 
Absolutely not. 
Aah! 
Good monster! 
Good scary monster! 
Hey, Ken, isn't that a fun place to stand? 
Oh, I forgot to warn you about my dog, Tracy senior. 
I trained him to hate white people, Because, not to profile, But most ghosts are white. 
This is my boy here. 
And look what Angie did to him. 
She set up an invisible fence. 
He gets shocked if he tries to leave the property, Just because he'd run away and cause car accidents And impregnate neighbors' horses. 
He's trapped here just like me! 
Sir, you're not trapped. 
Mrs. Jordan just wants you 
to be here for her. 
I'm trying, Ken, And I want to be responsible, But I've been me for a long time. 
Well, Mrs. Jordan 
isn't asking for a lot. 
Right now, she just has a craving For a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 
No, we're not supposed to do any sex stuff While she's on bed rest. 
Oh! Like a real one! 
I'm on it! 
Maybe this'll get Angie To stop calling me irresponsible. 
Just stay focused And take this sandwich to my wife. 
Nope! 
I'm in a strip club! 
My bad! 
Hey, Jenna, if I'm expecting about 20 people tonight, How much ice should I get? 
Oh, you don't want to mess with that stuff, Liz. 
Ice has caused a lot of ods in the porn community. 
Oh, you mean frozen water? 
I don't know. 
Well, I just don't want to forget anything. 
Don't worry. 
No one's expecting a lot. 
No, tonight is gonna be different. 
There's gonna be booze and a karaoke machine And that Black Eyed Peas song They wrote for bar mitzvahs. 
 Jenna Maroney to the floor. 
Sure, it will. 
Hello? 
Lemon, you know Subhas, The current first-shift janitor? 
Uh, kind of. 
According to the janitor community, You call him frequently Regarding home toilet situations. 
No, it's not that. 
We're dating. 
Lemon, please. 
Look, I just need his phone number. 
What does this have to do with Avery and Nancy? 
That is taking a backseat To this janitor situation right now. 
I need Subhas to step down. 
But Subhas does a great job. 
Look, five years ago, I promised Khonani the earlier shift. 
Why would you ever promise that? 
Honestly, these immigrants have a tough life, No health care, And I kind of just thought he'd die Before it became a thing. 
Are you sure that you're not just using this As an excuse to avoid your real problem? 
Lemon, this is a janitor emergency. 
I need that phone number. 
Okay, let me find it. 
Subhas...Scrolling. 
 I know you know it by heart. 
 917... 
All right, Khonani, If I've learned anything from recent experience It's that we have to handle this next step With Subhas very delicately. 
Oh, don't worry. 
Subhas will want to leave, Spend time on his hobbies. 
He collects classic car...  
Cardboard. 
Classic cardboard. 
Ken! 
Why did you let me go to a strip club? 
I tried to stop you, sir, But you threw your dog at me! 
This is bad, because I can't change! 
I'm like a chameleon, always a lizard! 
This better be a meeting, 'cause I'm important! 
Tracy, it's Liz. 
I want you to know that at my party tonight, You're off the leash. 
I want to see the behavior That got you kicked out of the inaugural ball. 
I can't, l.L. 
First of all, the secret service Never gave me back my t-shirt cannon, And second of all, I gotta stay home and take care of Angie! 
What? No! 
Come on, you have to come. 
I need you. 
This party has to be off the hook. 
People don't say that anymore. 
They say "surf party, usa." 
Tracy, this is important. 
I have to prove to my co-workers That I am not some angry, un-fun woman, Who doesn't deserve to be included. 
Look, Liz Lemon, I know your feelings are hurt, But parties are like frisbees. 
If you throw them the wrong way, They'll veer off in a bad direction, And then your kid will fall into a quarry. 
What? 
Don't throw a party for vengeance. 
It will turn on you, Like your wife after your kid has fallen into a quarry. 
You know what? Fine. 
I don't need you. 
I am gonna crush this party Liz-Lemon style. 
I don't know what to do. 
A party's in trouble, And I'm the only one that can save it, But your wife and unborn daughter need you here. 
 I'm torn, kpax. 
I know I should be here, But my body's gonna take me to Liz Lemon's. 
What do I do? 
Put the electric dog collar on me. 
It would be my honor. 
Subhas, thank you for coming in And for showing me your, uh, special book. 
More men in it than I would have expected. 
Book is book. 
Indeed. 
Uh, Subhas, you've been with us a long time, And you've done great work here, But we need some new blood. 
I've decided that it's time for you to step aside, And Khonani will take over at 11:30. 
No! I'm in a union! 
Well, I have a contract! 
Meeting over! 
No, no, hold on. 
There's always another option. 
What of we re-invent the way people Think about their nightly trash removal? 
No, thank you. 
What if the night shift just got a whole lot earlier? 
Gentlemen, there is a way For everybody to get what they want And for me to look like a genius and a hero. 
You're bullcrapping us. 
No, I am not. 
I am "innoventing." 
A word that I just innovented. 
NBC. 
It's fresh. 
Man, Tracy senior took off fast. 
He did not want to live here. 
Sir, far be it from me To question a plan this well thought out, But what's going to keep you from just taking the collar off? 
You're gonna pour glue in the lock. 
That's how my kids keep me out of the liquor cabinet. 
And, of course, I'll be here to help. 
No, Ken, there's something else you have to do... 
For all of us. 
Unfortunately, there's only one Tracy Jordan, But sometimes he's needed in two places. 
You're Tracy Jordan now. 
Go. 
Go save that party. 
Yes, sir! 
Wait. I don't walk 
that well. 
There he is. 
How's your first day going? 
Oh, I don't know. 
You tell me. 
Khonani, I don't know enough about being a janitor To understand what you're trying to tell me. 
There's no trash, Jack. 
Ever since you moved Subhas to 10:00, He takes all the trash. 
No trash left for Khonani. 
Okay, well, there's a solution to this. 
What if you and Subhas share 11:30? 
No, I wouldn't do that to 11:30. 
What are you talking about? 
What are you talking about? 
There are two people who want the same thing. 
They can't both have it. 
You need to make a decision. 
I can't. 
Damn it, I can't. 
Don't you think I know what it's like To have two amazing people Who both want the same thing? 
I do! 
And with Nancy and Avery, I'm the thing, Khonani. 
I'm the trash shift. 
That sounds very difficult. 
It's impossible. 
It's paralyzed me. 
I just want everyone to be happy. 
It doesn't work that way. 
One person's heart is going to be broken. 
You have to choose. 
I'm sticking with Subhas, Khonani. 
I'm sorry. 
Okay. I know 
that was hard for you. 
And don't worry. 
I have a job for me at fox...  
Woods. 
Foxwoods casino. 
My cousin is head janitor there. 
You ought to get that cough checked out. 
This better be meetment, I'm importing. 
Mr. Jordan, 
it's Kenneth Parcell, From work and friendship. 
Key, Ken. 
With all the excitement, I forgot that Mrs. Jordan 
Had asked me to get her blood pressure medicine. 
She left it in her car. 
But, sir, her car is parked out on the street. 
Oh, my God. 
I know. It's outside 
the electric fence. 
Oh, my God! 
I just didn't want to go outside! 
It's chilly! 
I can come back. 
This is all my fault. 
No. This is something 
I have to do myself. 
You're a good husband, Mr. Jordan. 
Sir, is there any chance Your dog followed me here? 
Yes. He probably 
picked up your scent And is hunting you. 
I suggest you cut off a finger And throw it in the river. 
Wow, Liz. 
Good work. 
This looks like the post-coital suite At the nba all-star game. 
Thanks, Jenna. 
Well, so now that everyone's here, Maybe someone should say a few words. 
 Absolutely. 
* Jimmy crack corn and I don't care * * Jimmy crack corn and I don't care *  What are you doing? 
 Juice fast delirium, Liz. 
Um, I'm glad you could all make it To cerie's party. 
I don't have a lot to say, Just that the bar is open And the karaoke machine is ready to go. 
Karaoke, awesome. 
Yeah. 
You think I don't know what that is? 
I know about Thursday night thunder And I know that I'm not invited! 
 Uhoh. 
I deserve to be loved! 
Oh, no, she's going wide. 
I am a proud, single woman! 
How did it become about this? 
Go out the window! 
Save yourselves! 
I may not have a real family, But I thought at least I had one at work, Which is not what I wanted for myself, by the way. 
You think when I was a kid, I dreamed of someday paying $1,200 For a karaoke machine To impress a bunch of pasty losers? 
And a professional singer, Who's beautiful, but doesn't know it. 
So now let's all go around the room And apologize to me! 
 Oh, my God, this is the worst...  
  I had nowhere else to go! 
   dog! 
Dog attack! 
Hmm. 
Maybe this doesn't work on people. 
Aah! Aah! 
Oh, my neck! 
My swan-like neck! 
Aah! 
Oh! 
Must...Fight...Through it. 
Also must...Weed...Lawn! 
I made it. 
I'm on the other side. 
I'm free. 
I can go anywhere I want... 
Like Liz's party Or one of those places Where you skydive over a huge fan. 
Hmm...Maybe it doesn't 
work on people any...  
Aah! It still does! 
Aah! 
Why is that thing following you? 
Hunting me! 
Electric collar! 
There's no fire escape in this room! 
Why are we even here? 
You make us show up, you start yelling, And then we get attacked by a dog! 
And Cerie didn't even come. 
That's just a cardboard cutout of her. 
But I rescued her. 
Quiet! Quiet! 
Everybody shut up! 
We need to figure out what we're gonna do. 
Oh, really? 
Now I'm a part of the group? 
Now you like me because you're in trouble And you need someone to bail you out? 
Yes, that's exactly why we like you. 
We love you. 
You solve our problems. 
That's what you're good at. 
So what if you're not fun at parties? 
Yeah. You know 
who's fun at parties? 
Paris Hilton, Andy Dick, Tracy, And they're all gonna burn in hell. 
Oh, God! 
If you deliver me from this, I promise every Sunday for the rest of my life, I'll go to...  
Huh? 
I'm through it. 
Pizza Hut. 
I'll go to pizza hut. 
Ha! 
Look, if this is a family, That makes you the mom, And you don't want to go out drinking with your mom. 
You want mommy to make the monsters go away. 
 Oh, please  come on! 
Everything's gonna be all right. 
Oh. Okay, Tracy senior, 
Let's see what you've got. 
Aah! 
Oh! Aah! 
Run! Run, my losers! 
Aah! 
Great party, Liz. 
Everybody take some cupcakes! 
 Aah! 
Hi, Subhas. 
I have an extra headshot I was gonna throw out, Unless you want it for something. 
No! 
You're not book! 
Why? 
What am I doing wrong? 
Wanting to be book is not book. 
Mm... 
So you solved your janitor thing. 
Now back to Nancy and Avery? 
Top gun high-five for courage? 
Only because you look like you need it so badly. 
I'm fine with that. 
Jack. 
Got a minute? 
Avery, of course. 
Are you okay? 
Oh, yeah, it's nothing. 
I was a guest on mad money last night. 
What's happening? 
Is one of you Jim Cramer? 
Okay, stop it, stop it! 
I didn't realize we were still airing that. 
Cramer's been dead for six months. 
Look, I know I'm supposed to go with you To Cerie's wedding this weekend, But I can't make it. 
Okay, I know you and I are in a period Of detente right now because of my other  Piece of tail? 
I was going to say romantic entanglements, But you do not want to miss this wedding. 
It's going to be New York royalty. 
The Astors, the Rockefellers. 
The Sbarros. 
Yes, I know, Jack. 
You think I don't want to know What pizzarina Sbarro is gonna be wearing? 
Then come. 
We both know that is a bad idea. 
Which is why I scheduled a conflict for this weekend I can't get out of. 
What is it? 
Well, if you must know, I'm on dodecacil. 
The pill where you only get your period once a year. 
Ugh! We're so close to beating 
that thing completely. 
Ah, well, my time has come. 
I'm going to a spa. 
Well, it's not really a spa. 
It's more of a fenced-in area In the Adirondacks. 
Fine. 
I'll go alone. 
And while I'm gone, Do some thinking about us. 
I promise you, this weekend will be filled With staring out windows while holding a glass of scotch. 
That means a lot to me. 
 Have a, uh, good time at your fenced-in area. 
And I'll see you in two weeks. 
What's that supposed to mean, you dumb douche? 
 ooh, it's starting. 
I should go. 
 Aloha means hello and good-bye. 
So aloha. 
 What? 
 What? 
Hi, handsome. 
I didn't know you were coming to New York. 
I'm here to see my man. 
You're not busy this weekend, are ya? 
Well, I am, actually. 
I have some thinking to do. 
Well, you can do your thinkin'. 
We'll just do it together on that tour boat That's painted like a shark. 
Hey, Liz, I need to know the name of the date You're bringing to my wedding. 
I'm coming alone, Cerie. 
But I would still like two meals. 
So is it okay if I sit you Next to my dad's mistress' cousin? 
Whatever makes it easier for you. 
Awesome. 
God, three weddings in one day. 
I am gonna be in spanx for 12 hours. 
My elastic line is gonna get infected again. 
Are you really not bringing someone to Cerie's wedding? 
 I don't care about having a date. 
What about Floyd's wedding? 
If I have to sit through that alone, I will rent a car, set it on fire, And drive it off a waterfall. 
I could set you up with my trainer. 
He's gay, but not when he's drunk. 
No, I don't need help, Jenna. 
I know where I'm gonna find my date, Because I have already met him. 
What are you talking about? 
Jack's mom said to me That there's only a few different types of men In the world. 
And, at my age, I have met all of them. 
So I'm gonna go back through my gentleman Rolodex  Sexual time travel. 
Just like my cinemax soft core, Emmanuelle goes to dinosaur land. 
I've dated plenty of good guys. 
My standards have just been too high. 
Yeah, they have. 
Meet me in the handicapped stall in ten seconds. 
Liz Lemon. 
I was just thinking about you the other day. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
I saw this gorgeous woman putting glasses On her daughter's Mrs. Potato head. 
The "why" is not important. 
Can we talk? 
Sure. 
I was just doing some baking. 
Uh, can I get you something to drink? 
What goes good with second chances? 
Ugh, water. 
I'd like water. 
So... 
Are you seeing anyone? 
Oh... 
This conversation. 
Uh, no, I'm still single. 
No one serious since you, actually. 
Well, that's good to hear. 
You know, when we broke up, It was because I felt like I was smarter than you. 
But that's so judgmental andand now I just  oh, my God. 
What? 
Oh, my hooks, heh. 
I'm just so comfortable with them thatthat Ohh. 
Whoops. 
Oh! Oh! 
Oh, not again. 
That was my last ungashed painting. 
How did this happen? 
Uh, freak accident. 
You know I work with doctors without borders. 
Well, I was helicoptering into Zimbabwe When I thought I saw somebody that I knew. 
So I waved from the helicopter, Which, it turns out, is a big no-no, And the rotor took my right hand clean off. 
And it turns out the person I was waving to Was not my old football coach. 
Of course not. 
You were in Zimbabwe. 
Well, it looked just like a black version of him. 
What about the other hand? 
Oh, well, to celebrate my return from Africa, My cousin and I bought a bunch of fireworks. 
You know what? 
This was a bad idea. 
I should just go. 
What, you're too good for me Now that I have pirate hook hands? 
It is absolutely not because you are disabled. 
I've been dumped by four different guys in wheelchairs. 
Look, I'll have you know, Liz, That I am in line for a hand transplant. 
There's this strangler who's about to be executed, And, uh, I got my hooks crossed. 
Oh, heh. 
Oh, my God, drew, It's not about the hooks. 
It's how you got that way. 
You're just too dumb. 
Wait, Liz. 
Don't go. 
Ow, it's hot! 
Yeah, of course it's hot. 
It's been in the oven. 
Now who's the dumb one? 
Uh, so handsome. 
Entourage meeting. 
I know which movie I'm doing this summer. 
Garfield 3: Feline groovy? 
It's a pun, because cats' paws have grooves. 
And this is really what You want to spend your summer doing? 
It's perfect! 
I'm playing Garfield. 
My whole part's being shot On green screen in three days. 
And they're paying me exactly one million teachers' salaries. 
Tray, I think it's time you take a risk. 
Maybe do a dramatic role. 
Go for the "o" in your "egot." 
What's this? 
Hard to watch, Based on on the book stone cold bummer By manipulate. 
It's about growing up in our old neighborhood. 
And it's real Oscar bait, sir. 
You say things like, "you don't know my pain," And, "you watch your mouth, tyrese." 
And, in a less dramatic scene, "I'll have hash browns." 
Interesting. 
And I've got to win an Oscar somehow. 
It's either this or I submit that animated film I drew about the holocaust. 
 This. 
 We should definitely do this. 
Nancy and Avery Almost ran into each other at the elevator. 
Seriously? 
You rode the shark boat? 
Was it scary? 
Oh. This whole thing... 
Is getting out of control. 
Yeah, you need to be honest with everyone. 
It's only fair that you tell Nancy about Avery. 
That is terrible advice! 
If I tell Nancy, It'll just complicate things. 
I need to keep her at arm's length this weekend. 
I prepared a very unromantic evening. 
First, we're going to see a documentary About female circumcision, And then we're going to eat too much Indian food. 
Okay, but you're just avoiding the problem. 
Sometimes, the right thing and the hard thing Are the same thing. 
I read that on a tea bag. 
If you want to be helpful, Just give me some more advice On how to keep a date asexual. 
  you know what? 
Sometimes I think  That's great. 
"you know what? 
Sometimes I think--" That's really annoying. 
I'm gonna use that. 
You're the best. 
  honestly, though, sometimes I... 
Okay, I hear it. 
I read the script. 
And? Did you like it? 
I hated it! 
I couldn't relate. 
What? 
It's about growing up poor in the South Bronx. 
Moving from foster home to foster home. 
Seeing a pigeon fight a baby. 
All of that happened to you. 
I don't remember that kind of stuff. 
I mean, I remember being born, of course. 
I remember learning how to ride a bike. 
But that was last year. 
From '75 to '82 is just a blur. 
Then you're repressing some stuff. 
That can happen. 
I remember the summer my webelos group went camping, And we were taken by the hill people. 
Next thing I knew, summer was over, And it was time for back-to-school shopping. 
Tray, this is an important film. 
Oh, brother. 
If you want to get your "o," You've got to reconnect with your roots. 
No, I don't. 
I was on a yacht with the roots last week. 
Dude! 
Hello, Dennis. 
Hey, dummy. 
You know, as soon as my beeper went off, I knew it was you. 
I got a personalized vibration For each chick I used to put it to. 
Hmm. 
Thanks for meeting me at my workplace. 
Yeah, what exactly are you building here? 
Hey, Liz, you want to be a millionaire? 
Hmm? 
Mr. Dennis. 
No, no, no, Jose. 
Only babies out here. 
Don't you want to be a big boy? 
 Ow. 
 Who's that kid? 
That's Jose. 
I met him through this program That places troubled adults with child mentors. 
Wait, are you planning to balloon boy him? 
Liz, listen to me. 
What was the one mistake those people in Denver made? 
One mistake? 
Yeah, there was no kid in the balloon. 
When Jose jumps out of there, or whatever, People are gonna go nuts! 
Oh, my God. 
Go, run. 
Unbelievable. 
These are the men in my life. 
What did I do wrong? 
Well, the first thing you did wrong Was you touched the balloon. 
This is a scientific facility, Liz. 
This is a public park named after Ron Artest. 
Yeah, and like Jose, Ron dreamed of glory. 
Hey, Liz... 
You'll be back! 
Hey, what's goin' on, huh? 
What's your deal? 
Lesbian. 
How was your dinner? 
Mm, I'm stuffed. 
That place is good. 
Way better than the Indian joint I go to in Boston, O'doyle's. 
 yeah. 
Uh...You know what I like 
after too much curry? 
A warm glass of milk And some John Philip Sousa marches. 
  Okay, I'm gonna go to the restroom Before I head back to the hotel. 
Oh, okay. 
I'll order you a car. 
 Mmhmm. 
  Hi, yes. 
I'd like to order a car, please. 
Account number 541390. 
I have to call you back. 
Oh! Jack! 
I've been through every guy. 
There's no one left. 
Come on, you sound like me at the Olympic village. 
Ugh, who cares? 
So I go to Floyd's wedding alone. 
Maybe I'll just lean into it And bring a cat in a baby stroller. 
Come on, you still have tonight. 
Liz, I want you to meet the guy That you're gonna be sitting next to tomorrow. 
He's told me his name, like, a million times, But I keep forgetting it. 
It's Wesley! 
No! 
I knew you'd be back. 
No, I'm not back, Wesley. 
Oh, of course, because you said You could find someone better than me. 
Well...Where is he? 
Stop doing that! 
You look idiotic. 
Of course I do. 
Excellent pantomime's supposed to look idiotic. 
Okay, I may be alone tonight, But I'm not done looking. 
Liz, I'm gonna guess That the last two months, There's been a lot of singles events in gymnasia, And, uh, oh, don't tell me. 
You revisited old boyfriends, didn't you? 
 that's never worked. 
Oh, my God. 
I hate you. 
Yeah, but that's it, isn't it? 
The only thing wrong with me... 
Is that you hate me. 
So with that as my only defect, Where do I rank With all the other men that you've been with? 
Okay, I have another wedding tomorrow. 
It's my ex-boyfriend Floyd. 
Will you come with me? 
And then there was Wesley. 
God, I hate you. 
Well... 
Good mornin'. 
I'm glad we did this, Jack. 
It was a huge step. 
But it feels right. 
Huge seems like the wrong word. 
I mean, sex is not that big a deal, right? 
How could something that animals do Be a big deal? 
Worms can do it with... 
Any other worm. 
Well, it was a big deal for me. 
Besides my ex-husband, You're the only other man I've slept with. 
Two men? 
That can't be true. 
Well... 
Uh, look, Jack... 
There's something I have to tell ya. 
I did somethin' bad. 
After my divorce, I went out with my girlfriends, And I danced with a guy. 
That's it? 
Also... 
It was after midnight on a Saturday, So technically, it was a Sunday. 
A man had his hands on my hips On a day that was set aside for the lord! 
There! I said it. 
Man, catholic guilt. 
Am I right? 
Those nuns really messed me up. 
Not me! 
What are we doing here? 
You told me we were going someplace boring. 
This is an awesome copy shop! 
Well, this copy shop is on the corner Of 157th street and  Lieutenant Uhura Avenue. 
That's where I grew up. 
Obviously, your building is gone. 
I guess someone didn't come up here To scout the location first. 
'cause someone else didn't sign off On the transportation budget. 
I never check that earthlink account. 
God, nothing's changed at all. 
It's changed completely, tray. 
What is wrong with you? 
We brought you up here to jog your memory, But I guess that was a waste of time. 
Because someone came up With this stupid idea in the first place. 
Let's just go. 
Why do I recognize that stairwell? 
It's all coming back to me. 
Oh, my God, I slept on an old dog bed stuffed with wigs! 
I watched a prostitute stab a clown! 
Our basketball hoop was a rib cage. 
A rib cage! 
Why did you bring me here? 
I blocked all this stuff out for a reason! 
Oh, lord! 
Some guy with dreads electrocuted my fish! 
Tray, use this pain to get your Oscar. 
I hate pain! 
I'm doing Garfield 3. 
And as soon as I make some copies of my passport, I'm never coming back here! 
Move! 
Lemon, I don't have time to talk about What you look like right now. 
That's how urgent this is. 
I need you to not put on your judgmental face When I tell you the following. 
I slept with Nancy. 
Fight it off, Lemon. 
Gah! 
What were you thinking? 
I wasn't thinking at all. 
She put on red underwear. 
You would think it would clash with her hair. 
But it didn't. 
You have made this so much worse. 
Sex always makes things worse. 
This isn't fair to Nancy. 
You have to tell her about Avery. 
I know, but Nancy's not Avery. 
Avery is cool, collected, Descended from Swedish valley people. 
Nancy is a fiery Irish nut job Descended from bog people. 
Well, I'm sorry, Jack, But I have got to go give a reading At the wedding of the only normal guy I've ever dated. 
And I have to be at st. Paul's 
in 20 minutes! 
 WaitFloyd's wedding is at a catholic church? 
Are they having a mass? 
Yeah, Kaitlin's catholic. 
He converted for her. 
Meanwhile, when we were dating, And I wanted to check out that unitarian church  Good talk, Lemon. 
 Mmhmm. 
  Thanks for holding my purse. 
Yeah. 
See how we help each other? 
I accompany you to Floyd's wedding. 
I hold your purse. 
This was meant to be. 
We're like Russ and Rebecca on chums. 
This is just a date, Wesley. 
You know that's not true. 
I wouldn't be here if there was anybody else. 
I'm your best option. 
And you're mine. 
You see, I, uh... 
I lost my job two days ago And am now facing a little residency issue. 
What? 
I don't want to go back to England. 
I can't suffer through the London Olympics. 
We're not prepared, Liz. 
Did you see the Beijing opening ceremonies? 
We don't have control over our people like that. 
I'm supposed to be up front for my reading. 
This is just a date. 
Right, and maybe up there, You'll fall in love with a handsome groomsman. 
But until then, Rebecca... 
 I'll be here always   while the rains fall in wales  Chums. 
Oh. 
Garfield effects test, take one. 
And...Act! 
Nermal! 
I hate you, Nermal! 
Almost as much as I hate Mondays! 
This is my lasagna! 
You hear me, Nermal? 
My lasagna! 
Okay, let's cut. 
Okay... 
Maybe a little less intense, you know? 
You're Garfield. 
You're a cat Who likes sleeping and lasagna. 
Well, I'm sorry, Shawn... 
And child actor whose name I can't remember. 
You haven't walked in my shoes. 
All my life, I tried to forget the things I've seen. 
A crackhead breastfeeding a rat. 
A homeless man cooking a hot pocket On the third rail of the g-train. 
The g-train, Nermal! 
There's something inside of me that needs to come out. 
And if Garfield 3: Feline groovy Can't tell my story, Then I'll win my Oscar elsewhere. 
Or I'll die tryin'. 
Okay, so are you not doing this movie? 
'cause that suit was made special! 
For your weird body! 
Are you doing a reading too? 
I'm Mike. 
I'm friends with Floyd. 
Hi. 
Excuse me, do you have a job, And are you here with someone? 
Uh, I'm a lawyer, And I'm single. 
Okay, friend, here's the deal. 
My name is Liz, I almost got 1,200 on my s.A.T.S, 
And I need a date for this wedding And I like your head shape. 
What do you say? 
I'd love to be your date, Liz. 
Okay. 
I like how forward you are. 
Now may I tell you something? 
I'm a plushie. 
Is that a fraternity? 
Kind of. 
It means I belong to a group of like-minded people Who dress up in mascot costumes. 
 OhKay... 
And have orgies in hotel rooms and state parks. 
There it is. 
Our term for intercourse is "yiffing." 
Would you excuse me, please? 
Okay, fine. 
Let's get married. 
Oh, yeah. 
And now a reading from Corinthians. 
"love is patient. 
"love is kind. 
"it is not jealous. 
"it is not pompous. 
"it does not envy. 
It does not boast. 
It is not proud. 
It is not rude..." 
Nothin' like being in church, Having spend the night doing a bunch of bad crap. 
Am I right? 
Yes, uh... 
Speaking of which, I'm seeing someone else, And I think I'm in love with both of you. 
 you lying bastard. 
After last night? 
Nancy, just let me explain. 
No, I'm out of here. 
You can't leave, Donovan. 
We're in the middle of mass. 
You and I both know you have to stay Until the final blessing, so let's talk. 
No, I'm not saying a word to you. 
The second this mass is over, I'm on the first train back to Boston. 
And you'll never see me again. 
"faith, hope, and love. 
"and as for knowledge, It will pass away." 
Stall? 
And now, an unscheduled reading That I think is appropriate for this lovely Romantic occasion. 
"but Onan knew that the offspring "would not be his, "so whenever he lay with his brother's wife, He spilled his semen on the ground." 
Sorry. 
"then Zipporah took a flint And cut off her son's foreskin." 
Oh, come on, bible. 
Help a lady out. 
"for he has sold us, And he has indeed devoured our money." 
I seen a blind guy bite a police horse! 
A puppy committed suicide after he saw our bathroom! 
I once bit into a burrito, And there was a child's shoe in it! 
I seen a hooker eat a tire. 
A pack of wild dogs took over And successfully ran a Wendy's! 
The sewer people stole my skateboard! 
The projects I lived in was named after Zachary Taylor, Generally considered to be One of the worst presidents of all time! 
I once saw a baby give another baby a tattoo! 
They were very drunk! 
Hey, Jack. 
 Did you dye your hair? 
 No. 
No. 
So how was your New Year's? 
Wonderful. My dear friend, 
the deep-sea explorer Bob Ballard, Brought over a 2,000-year-old amphora of wine From a sunken Phoenician trading vessel. 
The wine turned out to be quite toxic. 
My guests and I spent the stroke of midnight in my garden... vomiting. 
 Oh, my god, sorry. 
 Don't be. 
The whole night... the purging, the new year, 
The vivid hallucinations of Astarte... 
The Phoenician goddess of sex and war... 
It all wiped the slate clean. 
So... Nancy Donovan... 
What happened before Christmas was a mistake. 
She hasn't contacted me since, so clearly she agrees it's over. 
Well, that's healthy. A clean break. 
Exactly. A clean break. 
So what about you, Lemon? 
Is your 2010 off to a good start? 
Well, I spent New Year's eve with my family, Which was actually very special. 
My cousin Randy, This kid from this rural coal mining town, Came out to us. 
And I think old Liz Lemon had a little something To do with that. 
Randy's gay, everybody! He's gay. 
I think everyone knew. 
Finally! 
Over the break, I forgot what floor I worked on. 
Six, Tracy. 
Six! I knew it was a 
character from Blossom, But I couldn't find the Joey Russo button. 
Hold the door! 
You guys, I had the most amazing New Year's. 
I met James Franco's manager. 
It was like a fairy tale. 
My client, James Franco, he's actively looking For a relationship with a human woman To dispel certain unsavory rumors. 
Are you available for a fake romance with a movie star? 
Does chewing on a sponge trick your brain's hunger center? 
Yes! Yes! A million times yes! 
So this is some arranged Hollywood relationship? 
With James Franco. 
Can you believe they went to me Before Ayilla from The Real World: Cancun? 
I think it's great. 
The exposure will do wonders for you and TGS. 
Lemon, I want you and Jenna to have a meeting With James Franco and make sure his manager doesn't screw her. 
Too late! 
Wait, which way did you mean that? 
I had a pretty amazing New Year's too. 
My wife and I are trying for a daughter, And on New Year's eve I think I got Angie pregnant. 
No, no, no, no. 
Okay, but I was gonna describe it real good. 
Corrected by Lawman666 How was your New Year's, sir? 
Perfect. 
Oh, my god! 
As you know, on New Year's, I finally met my birth parents. 
So... thank you for asking about that! 
 I called her, Lemon. 
 What? 
I called Nancy on New Year's eve at 3:42 a.m. 
Damn that Phoenician wine! 
And you don't remember doing it? 
The last thing I remember is going into a closet And switching clothes with Bob Ballard. 
Look, I don't think you actually spoke to her. 
You hit pound after the number. 
I think you left a message. 
Cerie, get on her YouFace page. 
 Lemon, do you mind? 
 No. 
One second. Okay. 
Okay, her YouFace page says they're on vacation. 
They're borrowing a friend's condo in Florida. 
Oh, what have I done? 
The woman is on vacation with her husband as we speak, Probably having beach sex, which is the third best sex After elevator and White House. 
Is there any chance that she hasn't heard it yet? 
As a frequent leaver of drunken messages, I can tell you no good can come of this. 
As a frequent receiver of drunk messages, They are not cute, even when they're from Liz. 
Da da da... 
Good lord, I've Lemoned the situation with Nancy! 
I've got to erase that message. 
"Lemoned"? That's not a thing 
People are saying now, is it? 
Cerie? 
Lemoned. 
Doing it awesome. 
Here's the general idea, Jenna. 
You and I pretend that we met while filming a movie Called Space Attack. 
My title. 
This movie will never be released Because my performance will be deemed "too provocative for America." 
Oh, I wish I lived in France. 
But out of this experience, We found each other, et cetera, et cetera. 
Five dates a week, one fight a month. 
And because of a product placement deal with Jamba Juice, The fight will be in a Jamba Juice. 
I love Jamba Juice! 
And this is the non-disclosure agreement Regarding anything you two may learn about each other During the course of the relationship. 
Yeah, what exactly is Mr. 
Franco covering up here? 
i>- Liz, are you familiar with Japanese moe relationships, Where socially dysfunctional men develop Deep emotional attachments to body pillows With women painted on them? 
I am not, James. 
Neither am I, Liz! 
Which is why it's so weird The tabloids are running all these stories Saying I'm in love with a body pillow. 
I mean, it's crazy! 
Then why is that here? 
Why? 
I mean, why is this table here? 
I mean, why is that lamp here? 
Kimiko is It is here like any other object. 
Objects are made by men and used for many purposes. 
But we never love objects. 
Where do I sign? 
Hello? 
Liz? It's Randy, Randy Lemon. 
Oh, hey, Randy. What's up? 
Well, my parents and I are kind of fighting right now. 
Because you spilled orange soda on the couch? 
No, because of the gay thing. 
 So now I'm here in New York. 
 Wait, you're in New York? 
Yeah, I figured I'd come stay with my cool cousin Liz. 
Besides, what better place for me to be Now that I'm a homo? 
Is that the one we call ourselves? 
Nope. Get a cab, okay? Go to my apartment. 
168 Riverside Drive. 
Okay. Uh, actually there's a guy here 
Who offered to drive me if I helped him move a couch Into a van. 
Nope. That's a serial killer. 
Just get a cab. I'll pay for it. 
You have Amish here? 
Just get in the house, Randy. 
Kenneth, Jonathan, I need one of you to help me With a very special assignment. 
I hope it's me. 
But I'm honored just to be standing here with you. 
I'm going to drive up to Waltham, Massachusetts, Break into a woman's home, And erase a potentially embarrassing and destructive Answering machine message. 
The home in questions has a doggy door. 
That will be our way in... 
Using these hangers. 
Prove that you are lithe enough to accompany me to Waltham. 
It's Kenneth! 
You sicken me. 
I did it! 
Angie just called. She's pregnant. 
 That's awesome. 
 Congratulations. 
Yes. And it gets better. 
I just had a burrito! 
Well, now you just have to hope that it's a girl. 
I know it's a girl, Liz Lemon, Because I yelled "Susan B. Anthony" 
 At the moment of conception. 
 Well, that'll do it. 
We're gonna name her after the place That she was conceived. 
It was a pretty wild night. 
So we gonna name her either Virginia, Netjet, or bathroom at Teterboro airport. 
Oh, Liz, I'm in love. 
You're really not. 
James and I just had lunch at The Spotted Pig. 
The paparazzi were everywhere. 
The gossip blogs are calling us "James." 
It's a combination of Jenna and James. 
Jenna, look, I'm glad that you're having fun, But is this really all that you want? 
I mean, you and I are not getting any younger. 
You don't know that thing I sleep in isn't working. 
Don't you want more than some fake boyfriend? 
Don't you want to be happy? 
Liz, I am happy. 
All this attention, getting my picture taken, Having ice-cold diarrhea from drinking too much Jamba Juice... 
It's everything I ever wanted. 
Sorry, sir. 
That happens sometimes when I unhinge my pelvis. 
Oh, I was afraid of this. 
It's not an answering machine, it's a voice mail. 
Okay, well, we just need to look for clues To her password. 
It'll be like the Da Vinci Code. 
Ehh... albino monk! 
That's a mirror, Kenneth. 
She must have written it down somewhere. 
Try on the computer. 
Okay. 
Search... 
Oops! 
I just took my picture with that little camera thing. 
 Kenneth! 
 All right. 
I just need to erase that picture. 
Whoops, I just made it the desktop image. 
How did I do that? 
Wait a minute. 
Wait a minute! 
Ah! 
Nancy's husband has been sleeping on the couch. 
"emailing image to address book"? 
What is wrong with me? 
 Hey, Liz. 
 Oh, thank god. 
Randall Lemon, where were you? 
I'm sorry, I met these two guys And they just dropped me off. 
Well, I'm glad they brought you home, but... 
That's where I'm meeting them later... 
A bar called "Home Butt." 
 No, you're not. 
You came to New York to see your cool cousin, Not run around with strange gentlemen. 
You don't have to be so protective of me. 
This is New York City, Randy. 
Liz, you know how hard it was growing up gay In Methenburg, Pennsylvania? 
The local TV station edited Will & Grace down so much that it was just called Karen. 
Being in New York, this is the first time I've ever felt like myself. 
And I want to go out and enjoy it, have fun. 
Oh, we're gonna have fun. 
We're gonna stay here and make nachos And see who can fall asleep the earliest. 
Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! 
This is nice. 
Your hand feels like a pillow that's been in the microwave. 
Thanks. 
Okay, well... I'll see you tomorrow. 
Wait. 
Oh, it's okay. You can stop. 
 I was wrong. 
 What? 
I thought it was a paparazzo, But it's just some loser taking a picture of his kid. 
Oh...Right. Of course. 
That was fake. 
Did you know "paparazzo" is singular to "paparazzi"? 
Kimiko taught me that. 
I'll see you at dawn so you can get caught coming out of my apartment. 
I'll loan you a shirt. 
Try to look like you just got drilled. 
You know the deal. 
Sir, this computer is not helping with our search. 
If you type "Nancy's secrets" into the internet, Do you have any idea what comes up? 
A store that sells wig extensions. 
I've seen all this before, Kenneth. 
The separate beds, the empty closets, The brave public face. 
This is just another Irish Catholic couple Who won't admit to the world that their marriage is over. 
Sir, you don't know that. 
They're on vacation together right now. 
Are they? 
Nancy Donovan, still so organized. 
In German class, Mr. Kruger always chose her 
To sort the students. 
He was eventually arrested by Israeli commandos. 
Hmm. 
Look. 
On the 30th she took flight 1470 to RSW. 
He left the next day for CVG. 
They have to be different cities. 
Uh, Fort Myers and Cincinnati. 
Did you not learn your nation's airport codes in high school? 
She's at the beach house alone! 
That's the most divorced sentence I've ever heard. 
Mr. Donaghy, this snooping has to stop. 
We came here to erase... oh! 
I just took a picture of both of us. 
Good morning. Is that glitter? 
Oh, my god, did you go out last night After I won the sleeping contest? 
I forgot to wash my face, didn't I? 
I meant to do it at the club, But when I got into the bathroom, Everything started up again. 
Okay, that's it, I am taking you To the Port Authority. 
To get on a bus home, not to meet people! 
God! 
Look, you've had your fun. 
You've seen New York. 
You've made some really neat friends. 
Maybe that's enough for a first step. Okay? 
Yeah. Okay, you're right. 
But I'm not going home Until I give my cool cousin a makeover! 
i>- Is it gonna be fierce? 
It would be if it was 2006. 
Well, I do have this one cardigan That I've been kind of afraid to wear. 
Well, let's see it, girl. 
I'm not going back to Methenburg! 
Randy Lemon, you open this door right now! 
Okay, I do appreciate the irony That I'm the one stuck in the closet now. 
 Is that irony? 
 Not really. 
The sun is up and we are still in these people's home. 
God can see us now. 
We have to find that voice mail code. 
It's on the dry-erase board above the phone. 
What? 
I saw it there a few hours ago. 
But I wasn't done looking around. 
I'm ready to hear the message now. 
Sir, I don't mean to swear, But I am irritated right now. 
5-5-2-8-7. 
Thursday, December 30... 
Thursday. 
Friday, January 1st. 
3:42 a.m. 
Meine liebe, Gretta, It's Klaus. 
Remember Mr. Kruger's German class? 
I took it to be with you. 
Sat behind you so I could talk to you And try to see the top of your underwear. 
You were Gretta and I was Klaus Jack, are you coming in? 
I'm on the phone! Get back in the hot tub. 
Ballard, don't let them put their tops back on. 
I'm going to say good night With help from the poet Rilke. 
Because only German can capture What seeing you again has made me feel. 
Aus unendlichen sehnsuchten Steigen endliche taten wie schwache fontanen. 
Auf wiedersehen, Gretta. 
To erase, press seven. To save, press nine. 
For more options, press four. 
Sir, what are you doing? Erase it. 
I don't know. 
I thought I wanted a clean break, But if that message is how I really feel, Maybe she was supposed to hear it. 
Her marriage is falling apart. 
We meet again after all these years. 
Message deleted. 
Next message. 
Mr. Donaghy, whatever's happening here, 
It is not your place to interfere. 
If Mrs. Dougherty wanted you in her life, 
She would have called, given you some sign. 
But she hasn't. Let it go, sir. 
You're right, Kenneth. 
But you are leaving through the doggy door. 
Yes, sir. 
Hey, Liz, we're playing the Today Show drinking game. 
You do a shot every time they give a dumb travel tip. 
I like to take the shampoo And put it in the little travel-size bottles. 
Then I take the original bottle And put it back in the shower... 
For later. 
All: Yeah. 
Great. 
Liz, relationship emergency. 
Why are you wearing a man's shirt and no pants? 
Last night, James kissed me. 
And for a second, I forgot it was fake. 
And it was incredible. 
Now having lunch with James and the actress who plays my mom Somehow seems hollow. 
What's wrong with me? 
Jenna, what you're feeling is good. 
This thing with James is fun and exciting, But it isn't real. 
Deep down I think you want to be With someone you really love, And who can love you back. 
More friends on the plaza this morning. 
 Hi, guys. You celebrating? 
 We're in love! 
Trent's quitting the navy, and we're going to get married In Massachusetts. 
Wow. Congratulations. 
Oh, boy. 
If you want to save money on the trip, Consider taking a sandwich. 
Give 'em a hand. 
All: Yeah. 
Hey, baby, you new here? 
 Yeah, this is my first show. 
 Uhhuh. 
And before you worked here, were you an ass scientist? 
Because your ass... 
Blah, blah, blah. You get the point. 
 So what's your name? 
 Virginia. 
Virginia? 
But that's gonna be my daughter's name. 
 Are you also someone's daughter? 
 Uh, yeah. 
Is every woman someone's daughter? 
 Of course. 
 Uhoh! 
No... way. 
I was wrong, sir. There is a sign. 
She's been thinking about you for years! 
Why can't you be more like Kenneth? Go on. 
Her code... 5-5-2-8-7. 
Do you know what it means? 
Well, it's not a date. 
The first numbers are too high. 
It's not the numbers, sir. 
It's the letters. They spell "Klaus." 
Your name in German class. 
The class you were in with Nancy... 
In high school. 
 Back in Massachu...  
 I get it, Kenneth! 
I'm just trying to figure out my next move. 
I have to play it cool. 
You should buy a leather jacket! 
Get Cerie in here. Not you. 
Pack your stuff. 
You know, I don't think this is about you protecting me. 
I think you have a problem with people enjoying themselves. 
Why did you even leave White Haven, Liz? 
When was the last time you watched the sun rise? 
Sometimes at work... 
 Or kissed a boy you just met? 
 Gross. 
Or went dancing? I'm not going home 
Until I make you appreciate living here. 
Tonight we are gonna do that makeover for real. 
And then I'm taking you out. 
Yeah, okay. Fine. 
I mean, who am I to tell Jenna That she doesn't know how to be happy  When I can't even figure out,,,   Stop. So bored. 
Did I do that right? 
Yeah. That was super bitchy. 
You can't just break up with me. 
I'll sue you for breach of contract! 
Oh, you're being such a non-pillow right now! 
But don't you understand? 
I just want something real in my life for once. 
I want what you have with Kimiko. 
Oh, Kimiko-tan... 
What am I doing, Jenna? 
Pretending to be something I'm not. 
Making myself miserable when I've got happiness Waiting for me at home. 
Unless Kimiko's jealous of the ottoman. 
There's nothing going on there. 
That's a business relationship. 
Don't Lemon your life, James. 
Be happy. 
I'm the actor James Franco, damn it! 
And I'm in love with and common-law married to a Japanese body pillow! 
And I hope you had a good New Year's. 
Let me know the next time you and Mark are in New York, And we'll all grab dinner. 
Auf wiedersehen. 
Liz. 
 James. 
 Wow. 
You look great. 
Is Jenna here? 
No, Jenna and I broke up, actually. 
We both decided it was time to be happy. 
Me too. I'm saying yes to life! 
Okay. 
Let's do this. 
Hey, you got home late. 
Yeah, I, um... 
Randy, this is James Franco And our friend Kimiko-Tan. 
Hey, Randy. 
I'm gonna go to the bus station. 
I think that's for the best. 
I blame you three for my unhealthy attitude towards women! 
You have created an atmosphere of hostility and intolerance that everyone talks about all the time. 
Griz, when is the last time you told your fiance you loved her since the phone call I interrupted to make this announcement? 
Kenneth, your haircut is disrespectful to lesbians! 
Dotcom, do you ever read books by women? 
But George Eliot was a woman. 
Enough! I've made a decision. 
And starting next week, I'm adding a woman To the entourage. 
Really? 
Hello everyone I'm so happy to see all of you and to welcome you to season four which is of course the name of the restaurant the number one asian fusion restaurant in new york We'll be eating the number one selling food In the rest of america. 
 What it is? 
 All right! Cheesy blasters. 
?You take a hot dog Stuff it with 
some jack cheese Fold it in a pizza ? 
?You got cheesy blasters ? 
And then all the kids say, "thanks, meat cat." 
And then meat cat flies away on his, um, skateboard. 
I can't eat this. I'm a foodie. 
These cheesy blasters are here to teach us a lesson. 
The economy is struggling and your parent company is struggling with it why? 
Because we've lost tou with the heartland, consumers, with the real america. 
Ay, that's a vonsense term all of america is america. 
Like it or not, you are all part of the elite. 
When was the last time any of you worked for the minimum wage? 
Well, before i made it as a stand-up, i was a bucketrummer in the subway. 
 That's not a real job. 
 Oh, yeah? 
Then how come i got sued for sexual harassment at it? 
Acy, you may come from humble beginnings, but yove been rich for a long time. 
I think it's affecting your act. 
You know how on St. Barth's people 
be eating they lobster like this? 
Don't look at me in the eyes! 
Have i lost touch with my roots? 
I better talk to rabbi shmuley about this. 
Jack, if it would help the show, i would be willing to "go country." 
 Really? 
 "go country"?What does that mean? 
It's a totally legitimate career move, Liz the best way for a lady to get heat in this in is to either record a country album or have a lesbian relationship. 
We'll start with going country. To "tgs." 
We'll trick those racecar-loving wide loads into watching your lefty, Homoerotic propaganda hour yet. 
You just don't like anybody, do you? 
Well...

proudly presents =http://sfile.ydy.com= 
ÎÒÎªÏ²¾ç¿ñ µÚËÄ¼¾µÚÒ»¼¯ Lemon, how soon can you start the talent search? 
What talent search? 
"tgs" needs to find someone who can appeal to a broader audience. 
Those two do not test well outside the cities. 
Oh, he's burning money again. 
 What about josh? 
 Right, josh. I forgot about that guy. 
You think that's a good sign? 
Oh, jack, please don't make me look for a new cast member. 
You make these pronouncements on a whim and then i have to Lemon, this is a financial necessity. 
Every division of the company is reaching out to the middle of the country. 
Our new mammogram machine is called the "git 'er done 2000." 
Another actor? Why? They have 
so many feelings and opinions. 
All right, fine. I'll make reservations 
for us at some stand-up clubs. 
But don't tell anyone. 
Are you kidding me? Remember when jenna thought 
that blonde intern wanted to be an actress? 
I'm studying acting and singing and someday i'm gonna be just like you. 
I never did find her earlobe. 
 No one can know about this. 
 Know about what? 
 Pete's stealing money. 
 Liz's uterus fell out. 
I think i already knew that. 
Thank you, kenneth. 
Sir, i have a problem with my time card. 
So naturally you came to me because this company is just the two of us. 
I received a memo saying that pages are no longer allowed to work more than 16 hours a day. 
Yes, kenneth. Thanks to comrade obama's 
recession, we've had to cut overtime for pages. 
Oh, it's not the money, sir. 
It's just that i always work more than 16 hours. 
So i would be signing my name to a lie. 
The parcell name is synonymous with honesty as the hill people say, "parcell, gon' say del go up del saw say." 
We've all had to make sacrifices, kenneth. 
I had to downsize the payroll department to one guy and an envelope-stuffing machine. 
Today's my birthday. 
You can hand in an accurate time card as soon as we can pay for it. 
But trust me, we literally have no extra money. 
So do your part. Sign your time card. 
"dah don say da bay ton daw." 
Kenneth. Boop. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Elizabeth, i have your paycheck. 
Thank you, peter. 
All right, we're on for 8:00 at the stand-up cellar, Then we're going to nyu to see that improv troupe. 
Okay, i guess we leave separately and then meet there? I hate being sneaky. 
Luckily everybody here is dumb and you and i are good at lying. 
What are you two lovebirds whispering about? 
 Nothing. 
 Uterus nothing. 
Geez. I was just joking. 
I blame you and dotcom. 
You two have built a protective shell around me like a hermit crab or a mermaid booby. 
And now i've lost touch with the common man. 
Who's that? 
This is rolly the custodian. 
You said you wanted an ordinary person to reconnect with. 
Oh, hey, guy. Come on in. 
 So, rolly, where you from? 
 Brooklyn. 
Right on, my brother. 
My dear friend moby opened up a tea house in park slope. 
Does he know you? 
 Hey, rolly, you ever lose your remote control? 
 Yeah. 
And then your wife start getting all mad because the roof won't close And the bed that's in the shape of your face is getting rained on? 
I like you, rolly. 
Can i feel the rough skin on your hands? 
Sorry about that. 
What do you mean that was weird? 
You've sheltered me too much. 
I'm going out on the street and i don't want nobody to follow me. Nobody! 
Um, which one is the elevator i'm not afraid of? 
Right! 
I think the machine gave me someone else's paycheck. 
"john francis donaghy." 
Hey, he's got a girl's middle name too. 
But he said sacrifice... 
And no overtime. 
So many zeros. 
I thought you were leaving ten minutes ago of me. 
Oh, well, we're going two separate places, so it's not weird. 
No, nothing's ever weird now. 
Oh, hey, liz. You want to share a cab? 
I can't. I'm picking up my 
nutritionist and his elderly son, so. 
Pete, are you driving uptown? 
Love you too! Bye! 
Good morning, mr. Donaghy. 
I would like to speak to you on behalf of all the nbc pages. 
I'll give you a new york minute. That's seven seconds. 
Well, sir, we pages and i feel that me and they are not being treated fairly as regards paychecking. I'm nervous. 
We demand that you give us back our overtime. 
We went over this yesterday, kenneth. There's no money. 
Sir, i accidentally saw your paycheck. 
Well, i hope it was inspirational. 
All those zeros. It's 
downright un-american. 
That's where you're wrong, kenneth. It's extremely american. 
My talents are more valuable than yours, so i'm paid accordingly. 
Therefore, i'm entitled to my bonus. 
That's a bonus check? You 
said there was no extra money. 
"bonus" means "extra." 
I know that from game shows. 
You lied to me. 
I didn't lie, kenneth. 
I massaged the truth. 
What do you need to move past this? 
Well, sir, you made a liar out of me by making me sign that time card. 
I would like you to sign your name to a piece of paper that says, "i'm a big ol' liar." 
I'm not doing that. 
Well, then we pages have no choice but to go on strike! 
I like you, kenneth, but you do not want to mess with me right now. 
I am in the middle of a raging period... 
Of economic turmoil. 
Too late, sir! Page strike! 
I will wait. 
Ken! How do i get out of this building? 
 What do we want? 
 To get you sandwiches. 
 When do we want it? 
 Whenever would Be convenient for you. 
 What do we want? 
 To get you sandwiches. 
 When do we want it? 
 Whenever would Be convenient for you. 
 What do we want? 
 To get you sandwiches. 
 When do we want it? 
 Whenever would Be convenient for you. 
 What do we want? 
 To get you sandwiches. 
Lemon, how's our talent search going? 
The worst. 
I'm lying to everybody about something i don't even want to be doing. 
Pete and i keep accidentally touching knees under those little comedy club tables. 
What is a new cast member shut up! Shut up! Here it comes. 
Good morning, y'all. 
Well, who's this southern peach? 
Do you know the song are you ready for some football? 
Do i? That's what my phone plays 
whenever ray lewis calls me. 
Well, you are going to record a rollicking new southern rock theme for nbc sports. 
Yee haw! 
What sports does nbc have these days? 
Off-season tennis. Liz, i'm 
going to need jenna all day today. 
No. Wednesday is a very 
important rehearsal day. 
 Where's kenneth? 
 Picketing the building. 
Whatever religious undergarment kenneth wears is in a twist 'cause i took my bonus this year. 
They lost their overtime and you took a bonus? 
Is someone going to answer these phones? 
Studio 6h. 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
Why don't you give them some overtime out of your giant bonus? 
Aren't you trying to be johnny america right now? 
I am johnny america and this strike ends now. 
Hello? Is anyone there? 
I'm in sort of a tunnel and i see a man with a blue uniform. 
I think he's a friend. 
Oh, never mind. There's a door. I'm out. 
Oh, it's sunny! 
Hello, fellow human being. 
Would you like to ask me what time it is? 
Are you a large child or a small adult? 
You look regular. Can i get your name? 
Is it pedro? Is it 
craigford? Is it swimming? 
Are you a pre-op trans-centaur? 
Excuse me, do you have change for a $10,000 bill? 
I would like some chicken nuggets, a beer, and some of my wife's rice to stay. 
Excuse me, sir. Do you want to 
hold hands with a black millionaire? 
Does anyone want to be my friend? 
I'm normal! 
Len, this page strike is an embarrassment to the company. 
I get it.It's like i tell my assistant, 
"your weight is a reflection on me." 
I can't have that apple-cheeked goon outside screaming about my bonus. 
What are my options? 
Let me ask you a question, mr. Donaghy. 
How do you kill a snake? 
 Cut off the head. 
 Of course! Thank you. 
Now i won't be afraid to go into my garage. 
All right, here's how we play this page thing. 
I go undercover, infiltrate the union, take this parcell guy down from the inside. 
Very well. And you have 
undercover experience? 
They used to call me "the chameleon." 
Because of my slender frame and my big wet eyes. 
Has anybody seen my wallet? 
It's an l.l. Bean child's 
wallet from the 1970s. 
There's no money in it, but i was one hole-punch away from a free tasty d-lite. 
Damn it to hell! I hate my life! 
Liz, maybe you left your wallet in a friend's car last night. 
Maybe. 
And maybe i will run into that friend again tonight and then i will get it back from her. 
Yes, she will give it back to you when he goes home and gets it from her wife. 
What's up with you two? You've 
been acting weird all week. 
 Weird? 
 You left together last night. 
And then later, i saw you in front of a comedy club. 
 Oh, boy. 
 Uterus, oh. 
Are you guys doing it? 
Yes. Yes. We are doing it. 
That's disgusting. 
So there you go. Case closed. 
Pete and i are intercoursing each other. 
Hi, honey. 
Liz, i found your wallet in what our children call, "big wed cawr." 
 No, paula. No. 
 Let me get through this. 
If this is what pete needs... 
I would be willing to welcome you into our lovemaking. 
No. 
It's--no. 
Pete, i know that i haven't been very sexual since my mother died. 
No! Stop! Paula, stop! 
Okay, now look.We 
pete and i have been sneaking around because jack is making us look for a new cast member. 
 No! 
 I hate that! 
Lutz want to smash! 
Yeah, but you can't tell any of the actors. 
Do you not see me? 
Oh, dang it. I keep 
forgetting about you. 
You know what? I've 
had it with this place. 
I don't need this show because i could get a job tomorrow in the air force. 
I quit! 
Oh, somebody help him out, for god's sake. 
You got to use your lower back. 
That's incorrect. Lift with your legs. 
Attention! Attention, 
everyone! Strike update! 
I am happy to report that local 415 has joined our cause! 
I think we should just give up. 
"yeah, brandon's right." 
They are a blanket union that includes mall santas, horse whisperers, and bucket drummers. 
Hey, dudes, i'm organizing a viral protest on tweeter and youtubes. 
Anyone wants to get in on that, just write down your social security numbers. 
I'm sorry, brandon, what show are you assigned to again? 
Donahue. 
Hey, tray. How's the connecting 
to the common man going? 
It's going super great, dotcom. 
Meet my new friends, nobody and his wife susan walters-hyphen-nobody. 
I'm so far from my roots, i don't think i'll ever get back. 
What's that sound? 
Bucket drummers! 
Once i'm vested, i'm out of here. 
Who are we? 
 Pages. 
 Mall santas. 
And what do we want? 
 Overtime. 
 Cleaner beards. 
 Who are we? 
 These! These are my people. 
Bucket drummers, if you're striking, so am i. 
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 ?It's tennis night in america ? 
?Grab some buds and some brews 
? ?It's gonna be a fight ? 
Okay, i have to tell her that josh quit without her getting wind of the "new cast member" part. 
Well, do it now while she's drunk on attention. 
Or in an hour when she's just drunk. 
Cut! Good. Let's take five. 
You look pretty. 
Did you hear what happened? I am so upset. 
Oh, no. Okay, let me explain. 
I came in here to shoot these tennis promos and they had blue gels on the lights. 
You know that makes my teeth look see-through. 
You weren't here to do your job, liz. 
 Okay, well, josh quit. 
 Who? 
Jack's counting on country jenna to save the show, But i just want to understand what it is that's distracting you from the one thing you've been told to do. 
Really? You want to know 
what i've been doing? 
Yes, liz. Enlighten me. 
Jack is hiring a new cast member. 
If it is a blonde woman, i will kill myself! 
Jenna maroney is great! 
 No new cast member! 
 New what? 
If it's a blonde woman, i'ma kill myself! 
I don't know what to tell you, mr. Donaghy. 
Sympathy strikers, celebrities, clever signs. 
This strike is getting out of control. 
Then step up the pressure, len. Take parcell down. 
I can't. The man is incorruptible. 
He was impervious to the charms of the nympho coed charlene larue. 
Guide me. Tell me what to do... Nixon. 
May i come in, kenneth? 
Of course, sir. 
Would you like something to eat? 
I have some leftover turtle meat from dinner. 
Or as you would call it, "bonus" turtle meat. 
I'll just make myself a drink, if you don't mind. Where's the bar? 
Well, there's a bar in the shower that the previous tenant installed to keep from slipping. 
He still died in there though. 
We're not so different... You and i. 
Those glasses are for display only. 
We both grew up poor. 
We both put work above all else. 
And yet when people look at you, they see who they want to be. 
When they look at me, they see who they are. 
Sir, you sound like the mall santas when they come back from lunch. 
You win, kenneth. 
You have the moral high ground. I can't change that. 
But i can destroy you. 
If the pages are not back at work tomorrow morning, i am shutting down the page program... 
 Forever. 
 You wouldn't. 
Okay, josh refuses to un-quit. 
Jenna and tracy are on strike. 
We have no actors. Now we 
could rerun episode 214. 
No, no, no. That's the one where 
tracy tore up that picture of the pope. 
In his defense, it was pope innocent the fourth because he increased taxation in the papal states. 
Well, where are your solutions, liz lemon? 
You know, this whole thing is your fault. 
It's not my fault.Blame jack 
or kenneth or tracy or meat cat, 'cause i've had the cheesy blasters for three days. 
We have no show, liz. You better 
hope that strike ends soon. 
Why, so they can all go back to making my life a living hell? 
I hope they stay on strike forever! 
Is this really our first week back? 
Whenever would be convenient for you. 
 Who are we? 
 Pages. 
And what do we want? 
What are you still doing here, kenneth? I made myself clear. 
Well, sir, now that i know you're a liar, I was wondering if you were lying about canceling the page program. 
And then i thought if there were no pages, You'd have to pay somebody real money to do our jobs and give them health insurance. 
And if you don't even have money to pay our overtime, Then you certainly can't afford all that. 
What do you want? 
You know what i want, sir. 
"i am a big ol' liar." 
The strike is over! 
What did we get? 
A piece of paper that i can't really tell you about! 
Wait. Was this strike just over a 
personal thing between you and mr. Donaghy? 
Massage it, kenneth. 
No, it wasn't!

?grab some buds and brews

?'cause here in real 
america it's tennis night? 
And I think we can both conclude that we finished Q1 with better than expected results. 
And I can promise that my performance will improve, especially if you're a little more flexible on your end. 
I love it when you tlak dirty to me. 
I cannot wait to see you tonight. 
What are you going to wear? 
Think slutty grace Kelly. 
 Oh, God bless you. 
I'm picturing it right now. 
And the opposite of that just walked in. 
 Tell Liz I said hi. 
 I will. 
 Happy Birthday, Jack. 
I got you a card. 
It's one of those new ones where you can record a message. 
Test, test, test. 
This is a test for Jack's card. 
    wonder woman     excuse me, how do you re-record on these things? 
Whatever. 
I'll definitely figure it out. 
 Thank you, lemon. 
But my true present is that exquisite ensemble. 
You look like a prison weed dealer. 
 I'm coming back from a singles dodgeball match, okay? 
 Good God. 
 The ymca near my apartment offers a variety of singles activities, and I am forcing myself to go to all of them. 
 Well, I'm glad you're trying, but I wish you didn't have to lemon, are you wearing a cup? 
 Oh, I forgot, only guys can get hurt there. 
 I just wish it were easier for you. 
You need an avery simple, fun, uncomplicated. 
As my good friend and fox-hunting partner Mary j. Blige would say, 
"no more drama." 
 Happy Birthday! 
 Nancy, what are you doing here? 
 It's done, Jack. 
I'm divorced! 
  Ruh-ro! 
    30 Rock 4x17     Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter 
 hey, how did your dodgeball thing go? 
Did you meet anyone? 
 Not really. 
I mean, there was one okay guy. 
Eat it, bitch! 
 What is wrong with you? 
He was flirting. 
Did you ever even talk to him? 
 I yelled at him about a rule violation. 
 Oh... 
 His foot was over the line. 
 How many more of these things are you going to? 
 Line dancing this afternoon, then tomorrow is the wine and cheese tasting. 
Or, as I like to call it, singles fart suppression. 
 Maybe I should go with you, be your wingman. 
 Oh, thanks, Jenna, but you don't want to do that. 
 No, it would be good acting research for me. 
I'm up for a role in national lampoon's van Wilder's wingman, inc. 
 I look forward to not watching that on an airplane. 
 And this is our wardrobe department. 
Uh, Nancy, this is the star of our show, Tracy Jordan. 
Tracy, this is  not now, Jackie d. 
I heard on the walkie-talkies that there's a redheaded milf walking around with some executive. 
 You know what, that felt really good. 
  So I'll see you at lunch. 
 All right. 
 Kenneth, would you please show Mrs. dougherty 
I'm sorry, um, Ms. Donovan, 
to the elevator? 
 Have we met before? 
 You shut your mouth! 
 Now you're having lunch? 
Does Avery know about this? 
 Lemon, the grownup dating world is like your haircut. 
Sometimes awkward triangles occur. 
 I feel like you've been saving that one. 
 Obviously, this is unexpected. 
I really didn't think that Nancy would ever get divorced. 
 Why would a lady get divorced at 50? 
Stick it out! 
Men die first, then you have two wonderful years, then you die. 
 Yes, Nancy showing up is a game changer. 
But if I blow this up now, all three of us will suffer. 
 So what are you gonna do? 
 I'm going to make the most of this opportunity. 
I'm going to pursue both relationships, see how they develop, and then make an informed decision. 
 You're gonna juggle them? 
No. 
Even you can't pull this off, Jack. 
Mrs. doubtfire shimself 
could not do this. 
You are gonna blow it, and you're gonna end up alone, and you're gonna have to go to singles dodgeball. 
Put on these rec specs. 
This is your future. 
Put 'em on. 
 Lemon, no. Lemon 
oh, God! 
The band is soaking! 
Ugh... 
 You will not believe what just happened to me. 
A guy on the subway just called me a biggledeeboo. 
 What's a biggledeeboo? 
 It's an 18thcentury word for "dark-skinned moor." 
I've learned the word "black" in every language, just so I'll know when to be offended. 
Russian, chernyi. 
Korean, hoog-een. 
Dolphin... 
Eeeeeeeeeeeee! 
Eeeeeeeeeeee eee-eee-eee! 
 Well, I'm sure it was just an isolated incident. 
 Nuhuh, I'm telling you, dotcom, old-school racism is back. 
 How can racism be back when we elected a black president? 
 Barry obams is the one who brought it back! 
 So you're saying that racism is back because white people no longer feel sorry for us? 
 Hey, something's going on. 
You know what I seen last night? 
A slovin shield commercial with a black burglar! 
 Aah! 
Black man! 
 That's not good. 
 Come to think of it, I saw a white judge on law & order last night. 
 Oh, yeah, it's back on! 
Get ready, son. 
All you've ever known is your affirmative-action job and queen latifah covergirl commercials. 
 And one, two, and hip, four, five, six, and seven, eight. 
 I'm sorry, are we expecting more men? 
 I'm jerem! 
I collect posters. 
 Look at me, jerem. 
I know all the steps. 
 Kind of. 
         So I know you're, like, the man who has everything. 
You know, two of everything, in fact. 
  Right. Hilarious. 
 But I, um I got you a birthday present. 
It's goofy. 
It's nothing. 
  Schwitzer's saltwater Taffy! 
I haven't had this since that summer we worked on cape bilge. 
 I didn't have the heart to tell Mrs. schwitzer 
that you've moved to New York, so I told her you were in jail for manslaughter. 
 Oh... 
 I even got them to make you that flavor we invented. 
 Peanut butter and Miller high life. 
Oh, Nancy, thank you. 
I love it. 
 Mmm. 
 So I'm, uh... 
I'm only in town a couple of days. 
Do you have to go to this black-tie thingy tonight? 
Is it really better than me? 
 It's not better. 
It's different. 
There's no way of knowing at this point which is better. 
 What? 
You're a wackadoo, Donaghy. 
 Well, I want to spend as much time with you as possible. 
So why don't we meet for drinks after? 
 You sure? 
 Yes. Definitely. 
 You always know you're at the right party when it feels like the riddler is about to attack. 
Look at this guest list. 
Harvey weinstein, Glenn Beck, Ashley Olsen. 
 These are the people that make New York great. 
 Come on, let's do the red carpet together. 
The post will love it! 
"Money bunny Avery Jessup steps out with sexecutive Jack Donaghy." 
 Well, no, I can't have my picture taken with you. 
Someone might see it. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Um, I'm just saying you're a business reporter, and I'm trying to get fcc approval for the kabletown deal it wouldn't look right. 
Like Santa claus taking a shower. 
 Okay, I think I get that. 
 You go ahead. 
I'll meet you on the other side with a drink. 
 Okay. 
 Avery, over here! 
 I'm jarem! 
 Chelsea, hey, Chelsea handler, over here! 
 Liz, I work here because I'm hilarious, right? 
 Is this a trap? 
 Earlier today, Tracy made the accusation that I am the beneficiary of affirmative action. 
 Yeah, well, Tracy is a buffoon. 
 That is a 15thcentury term for a black pirate! Racist! 
 Is my presence on this staff tokenism? 
 Toofer, you are an invaluable member of our team. 
 Then why are my paychecks a different color than Frank's? 
 Because your salary does not come out of our budget. 
Look, toof, you provide a point of view that is essential to keeping the diversity guy from bothering us. 
 I do not want a job I did not earn. 
I am about to utter two words a Harvard man never says. 
 "I'm cool"? 
No, I'm sorry. 
You can't set me up like that. 
Don't quit. 
 I quit! 
 Wow, you look like Mr. monopoly. 
 And you look like you won second prize in a beauty contest collect $10. 
  You sure you don't mind just having a drink up here? 
I walked all the way to battery park today in high-heeled boots, like a moron. 
 No, I prefer it. 
Something from the minibar? 
 Oh, no, are you kidding me? 
At those prices? 
Left over from my amtrak ride. 
 That's my Donovan. 
 So listen, uh, I know we've waited a long time for me to be single, and I really want our first evening together to be special and oh, God, this is so queer. 
I guess what I'm trying to say is can we wait until the morning to fool around? 
'Cause I'm exhausted, and I got the night bloats. 
 Yes, the morning. 
I'm exhausted too. 
Let's just watch tv. 
 There's a Lee Marvin marathon on Turner classics. 
 I thought you said this wasn't going to be sexual. 
Oh, this is perfect. 
I should take this. 
Is everything okay? 
 Is everything okay? 
Here are the bullet points: Jeter's apartment. 
We're playing beer pong. 
It's New York Yankees versus former mayors. 
I got 10 grand on the mayors. 
Get down here. 
Oh, come on, dinkins! 
You're killin' me! 
 Oh... 
 What's going on? 
 It's work. 
I've gotta go. 
Uh, no. 
I have to go. I'm sorry. 
I'll call you. 
 Don't work too hard. 
 How's your episode of three's company going? 
 Like three's company, it's titillating, yet anxiety-producing. 
I need your help, Janet. 
 Aw, man, being Janet sucks! 
 After the party last night, I went to Nancy's hotel room. 
Then Avery called and made an offer I couldn't refuse. 
 Ew, were you with both of them on one night? 
You are officially a John mayerstyle garbage  I didn't have sex with anybody. 
You were right, lemon. 
I don't think I can do this. 
Whichever one I'm with, I think she's the one. 
How do you choose between Lee Marvin and Derek jeter? 
 On looks, Lee Marvin. 
 I feel like I'm being pulled apart, and I need your help. 
Today I'm going to the boat show with Nancy. 
Tonight is my birthday dinner with Avery. 
I hate the idea of Nancy having dinner alone at the hotel tonight, so I told her that you wanted to take her out. 
 No, I have singles wine and cheese tonight. 
 Then take Nancy with you. 
 You know what, this whole thing is unfair. 
You're juggling two beautiful women while I have to pay to have kickballs whipped at me. 
This is gender inequity out the Yang! 
 This has nothing to do with the slight difference in our genders. 
 Yes, it does. 
The older you get, the more distinguished you are. 
Meanwhile, I'm reading a book called hiding your arms, hiding your anger: Dating over 35. 
 Lemon, I am successful romantically because I am confident, open, and positive. 
You are negative, pessimistic, and in danger of becoming permanently sour. 
 Is this you asking me for a favor? 
 Look, if I don't handle this situation right, I'm going to lose both of these women. 
And even worse, they're both going to lose me. 
 Okay, fine. 
I'll do it. 
Ugh ow, my eyes are stuck. 
Help me! 
Okay. 
 I can't believe toofer quit! 
Do you have any idea how much paperwork I have to fill out because of this? 
He left with his I.D. 
Tracy! Tracy, trey. 
Buddy, will you call toofer and talk some sense into him? 
 Oh, yeah, just ask the black guy, 'cause we all know each other. 
Pete, could you tell a bald eagle to stop scaring me at zoos? 
You know, I've been wanting to say this for a few seconds now. 
This workplace has become a hotbed of old-school racism. 
 Come on, trey, no one here is racist. 
 Oh, yeah? How come 
I'm always forced to play ridicarus characters that don't enununciate well. 
 Uh... 
 So what? 
Look at italians. 
We're always portrayed either as goombahs or guidos, but we don't care because we're successful members of society. 
So maybe your problem is that you're finally being treated like everybody else. 
 Nah, you could play it off, but I know you're all secretly mad 'cause we finally have a black Disney princess. 
 You know, there actually hasn't been a white princess since 1991. 
 Tiana, mulan, pocahontas, jasmine--wow, she's right! 
 There are little blonde girls in this country who have no idea they can be beautiful. 
That's why I started "jenna's kids." 
It's a summer camp that teaches pretty blonde girls how to be mean. 
 You, call toofer. 
Beg him to come back. 
 Absolutely not. 
 Of course not. 
The aryan hates and fears the African man, as we so clearly saw in the blade movies. 
 What? No, 
I didn't want toofer to quit, but I respect his decision. 
As a woman in this business  oh, stop that! 
 Shut up, Liz. 
 In this world, I have never received special treatment, at work or in love. 
So why should anybody else? 
Oh, liz  I love coming here. 
You know, this is one of the only restaurants in America with a veal tank. 
 It just tastes better when you pick your own. 
 You know, Jack, I think I know the real reason you were acting weird about doing the red carpet with me. 
 Okay. 
 You're selfconscious about our age difference, and you thought you'd look old standing next to me. 
 I see. 
You're very perceptive. 
 I get why it's on your mind, what, with your birthday and my amazing skin. 
And sure, people in this restaurant might think you're my dad... 
 Or that you're my prostitute. 
 Exactly. 
But what does it matter? 
 Uh, maybe it does matter. 
I mean, yeah, if I'd met you 20 years ago well, not you, because you would have been 16, which is, of course... 
Wrong. 
I'm just saying, are we kidding ourselves with this? 
I'm 51 years old. 
Do you even know who Lee Marvin is? 
 The sportscaster who bites ladies. 
Who cares? 
 Then again, if I were with someone my own age, I'd miss out on a lot of things I want. 
I'd never have a family... 
 Jack? 
Relax. 
We've only been together a month. 
We don't need to worry about this stuff now. 
Especially not on your birthday. 
 Are these the cufflinks  Reagan was buried in. 
Don't ask how I got them. 
But I do know the access code to his pyramid. 
 Oh, Avery, this is too much. 
 No, it's perfect, Jack. 
Someday you'll be as a great a man as he was. 
 I do like jelly beans. 
 Look at me, I'm at a singles event in New York City. 
La-di-dah. 
I mean, sure, it's a little bright in here, and they could have rescheduled that youth karate class... 
All: Yes, sensei. 
 But this is fun! 
 Oh, come on, it's pathetic. 
Why am I doing this? 
 'Cause you're living life. 
Hey, how you doing? 
You see avatar? 
 Yeah. 
That new 3-d is amazing. 
 Yeah, I don't know, I found myself rooting for our boys in uniform, not those blue hippies. 
But full disclosure, I had a couple of drinks prior to. 
You know Liz? 
 Yeah, I thought that marine robot thing  they weren't marines. 
Some of them were former marines, but they were mercenaries working for a space mining company. 
 All right. 
See you later. 
 What are you doing? 
I was warming him up for you, and you start talking about space mining? 
 What, do you just want to sit around and be wrong? 
 Come on, Liz, every man in this room is single. 
Who do you want to meet? 
  Nobody. 
I mean, that guy has a beard. 
Who knows what's under there? 
Tattoo guy, too promiscuous. 
Tshirt tucked into jeans pbbbt! 
Oh, that guy looks like he'd just be mean to me. 
 God, Liz, you're so negative. 
 Oh, now you just sound like Jack. 
 Hey, I'm no relationship expert. 
The last time I used a birth control device, it was the '70s, and it looked like soap on a rope. 
But every time you say what you don't want, you sound like a cranky cow, and you're not that. 
You're smart and you're fun. 
So stop talking about what you don't want, and start figuring out what you do want. 
And then go get it. 
  Jerem, look how drunk I am, and how full of cheese my mouth is! 
 That's not that much cheese. 
players shouting]  No, no, don't. 
 No, it's okay. 
I don't want to hurt you. 
But I'll tell you what I do want. 
I want someone who will be monogamous and nice to his mother. 
And I want someone who likes musicals, but knows to just shut his mouth when I'm watching lost. 
And I want someone who thinks being really into cars is lame, and strip clubs are gross. 
I want someone who will actually empty the dishwasher instead of just taking out forks as needed, like I do. 
I want someone with clean hands and feet, and beefy forearms, like a damn Disney prince. 
And I want him to genuinely like me, even when I'm old. 
And that's what I want. 
  You making much English. 
This is fun alcoholics meeting! 
 Yeah. 
 Well, well, well. 
Never got a hand up is that right, Liz lemon? 
 What? Come on, Pete, 
I'm in a good mood. 
 And it's over! 
While trying to find toofer's dental records in personnel, down on the basement mezzanine, I pulled your file. 
"Elizabeth" I don't know how to pronounce your middle name "lemon." 
   You attended the university of Maryland on a partial competitive jazz dance scholarship. 
 So? 
 So ncaa competitive jazz dance was created as part of title ix. 
You were able to pay for college because of a program that favored women. 
 Favored women to correct an imbalance. 
 There's more. 
You were only hired by the second city because they needed someone who could remember to feed the theater cat! 
 Oh, no...Otis. 
 And you're gonna hate this one. 
The only reason nbc picked up the girlie show is because of the flak they got from women's groups after airing the action drama bitch hunter. 
 Happy Birthday, bitches! 
 Oh, my God! 
I'm no better than toofer... 
Or lutz, with his bs inuit ancestry, or you, whose dad was in the masons with Dave garroway. 
I shouldn't be here. 
 This is America. 
None of us are supposed to be here. 
 I need to dance this out. 
Jack, would tgs have gotten on tv if I was a dude? 
 No, it was affirmative action. 
Why do you think your checks aren't the same color as Howie mandel's? 
Two amazing gifts from two amazing women. 
 Each gift symbolic of the woman who gave it to you. 
One, the past a connection to home and the man that you were. 
 The other, the future... 
The promise  yes, lemon, I get it. 
I can't let this go on any longer. 
I choose...Avery! 
Right? Yes. 
 Okay, but are you sure it's not just because you saw Avery last? 
 No. Well... 
 Hey, Liz, how'd it go with the guys at dodgeball? 
You let one in? 
Into your heart, I mean. 
God. 
 Oh. It actually went okay. 
 I'm sorry you and I couldn't get together last night. 
 Yeah, me too. 
But now I gotta run. 
But what do you say I come back in a couple of weeks, I cook you a pot roast, we drink too much wine, and see how it goes? 
 That sounds amazing. 
 We'll be keeping an eye on this story as it develops, but it's clearly a conflict of interests. 
And at the risk of editorializing, I am personally outraged. 
 Hey, what are you doing here? 
 Liz has invited me back as a budgeted employee. 
Apparently, I am the only one among us who can spell. 
 Welcome back, James. 
 Hang on, who's James? 
 As a condition of my re-employment, I have requested that I no longer be called "toofer." 
 Great! 
New nickname suggestions. Go! 
 Victoria q. Nerdballs. 
 Kanye East. 
 Super virgin! 
 Splock. 
Short for "black Spock." 
 Threefer, 'cause you're also gay. 
 Okay, fine, fine! 
Toofer. 
I'll just go back to toofer. 
 Yay! 
Welcome back! 
Hey, liz, my daughter's selling valentine cookies For a school fundraiser. 
Valentine's day is a sham Created by card companies to reinforce and exploit Gender stereotypes. 
Evelyn, this is the lady I was telling you about. 
I like valentine's day. 
Tommy reticker gave me a card. 
Ha. Learn from my sexual 
misadventures, evelyn. 
Last valentine's day, I watched my boyfriend drew's Mother/grandmother die. 
I met floyd on valentine's day, But he left me for the ty of cleveland. 
And forget about dennis! 
That pervert would always just try to get me drunk All right, so zero cookies. 
No, I'll buy some cookies. 
But not for valentine's day. 
Instead, these cookies celebrate The February 14th birthday Of anna howard shaw, famed american suffragette. 
Happy anna howard shaw day to you, evelyn. 
Come on. 
A happy anna howard shaw day to us all! 
Lemon, which one of these ties do you find more attractive? 
 The red, definitely. 
 Thank you. 
I've got to look camera ready tonight. 
I'm being interviewed on cnbc. 
Have you ever watched The hot box with avery jessup? 
No, cnbc gives me a headache. 
I get all my money advice from pbs. 
Where should I put my money: In tech stocks or the housing market? 
Tech stocks, foxy moneybags, tech stocks! 
Sir, your reservations are all set for valentine's day. 
And just to be clear, are you and I exchanging No. 
Why do you have valentine's plans? 
What about nancy? 
Nancy knows that I'm here when she's ready. 
But after what we went through, our marriage, The way that it ended between us, It was, uh, very intense. 
Like when you think there's one more stair, But there isn't. 
And all of the sudden, you're, like, "whoa!" 
Exactly. 
So for now, I just want something fun and easy. 
Frankly, I could use a win. - A win? 
What's with the euphemisms, jack? 
Why don't you just say you want some... 
 Is that sex, lemon? 
 Is the way I do it. 
So who's the lucky lady? - I'm not sure yet. 
I have three dates set up across the city, And I hope one of them works out. 
How are you gonna handle three different dates? 
Well, I have a system for first dates. 
At the appointed time, jonathan calls me And tells me that I have a conference call With the geneva office. 
If I don't like the woman, I have an excuse to leave. 
If I do like her, I loudly tell jonathan That I'm doing something more important. 
The woman is suitably impressed. 
And I'm guaranteed to see some underwear. 
Perhaps a, uh, bra with a front clasp. 
What? 
What are your plans for valentine's day, lemon? 
I am taking myself out of the equation entirely. 
I scheduled a root canal for February 14th, jack. 
I will spend half the day in twilight sleep. 
Then I will go home and watch the lifetime original movie My stepson is my cyber-husband. 
Wow. That is inspired. 
You are truly the picasso of loneliness. 
Or I am that painting elephant of being awesome. 
Oh, kenneth, have any packages come for me today? 
No, miss maroney. 
Well, that doesn't make any sense. 
Valentine's day is always a huge deal For maynard roger hoynes. 
That's my stalker. 
You have a stalker? 
It's a real problem in the celebrity community. 
But if beyonce simply answered one of my letters, I'd stop trying to break into her house. 
So if you haven't heard from him, Isn't that a good thing? 
Kenneth, the celebrit y- stalker relationship Is very special. 
Maynard's debilitating devotion Validates how wonderful I am. 
But what does it say about me if he's moved on? 
Maybe to one of my peers like julia roberts. 
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation, Miss maroney. 
Hey. 
Has anybody heard about any cool new sex positions? 
My girlfriend's visiting for valentine's And I want to keep things caliente. 
Oh, my god, lutz. 
Are you still pretending karen exists? 
She's real. 
Would a fake woman have a personal web site At jdlutz. Com/karen/proof? 
Oh, good grief. 
My cousin set me up on a blind date for valentine's, And I just found out the girl is... Well... 
Urban. 
Are you saying she's black? 
I don't know how to get out of this. 
Dude, come out with me. 
You know that load with the messed-up teeth Who cleans the urinals? 
She'll only go out with me If she can bring her ugly sister. 
Wow, I can't believe you guys Are letting valentine's day win. 
Not me. One word. Oral. 
Two words. Oral surgery. 
I'm having oral surgery and skipping valentine's day. 
Doctor's orders. 
Oh, that reminds me, dr. 
Kaplan's office called. 
They want to know who's picking you up After your procedure. 
 What? 
 Yeah. It's an insurance thing. 
Any time they have anesthesia, Someone needs to bring you home. 
Hey, that stuff messes you up. 
When I had my wisdom teeth out, I tried to get in the bath with my mom. 
Okay, is there any chance that you could take me home? 
Sorry. 
Every year, paula and I rent this big suite up at niagara. 
And then she takes the kids there And I stay home and get wasted in my garage. 
It's what keeps the magic alive. 
Welcome back. 
I'm here with sheinhard t- universal vice president Jack donaghy. 
Thanks for sitting in the hot box, jack. 
My pleasure, avery. 
Also joining me, walter stein, Whose bow tie tells us he works for some liberal think tank.

One second. 
Hey, tray, I really need a ride home from the doctors On valentine's day. 
 Can't do it, li  lem. 
On valentine's day, Angie and I rent a room with a heart-shaped hot tub And cook chili in it. 
Then we take it to a soup kitchen And that's where it starts to get sexy. 
Hey, jenna, please tell me You haven't already concocted Your usual valentine's day drama. 
Can't talk, liz. 
I just got my stalker's work address from his parole officer. 
And I'm gonna confront him about why he's ignoring me. 
Hey, kenneth. Are you free on valentine's? 
No, miss lemon. I'm sorry. 
I will be attending an al I- day abstinence rally. 
You're welcome to come. 
I think I've got an extra Gender-neutralizing hood. 
 No. Thanks. God. 
 Hey, liz! 
 Hey. 
 The answer's no. 
Hello, maynard. 
Jenna, you shouldn't have come here. 
Well, what was I supposed to do? 
It's almost valentine's day And I haven't heard anything from you. 
Has the dog who gives you your orders died? 
No. Brandon's fine. 
Jenna, we need to talk. 
I don't think I can stalk you anymore. 
No. You don't mean that. 
Look, I have a new therapist, I'm taking my meds. 
I can't even see electricity Shooting out of your head any more. 
Well, is there someone else? 
It's one of those kids from glee, isn't it? 
Jenna, please, don't make a scene. 
I always knew this would end someday. 
I just thought it would be with me in the trunk Of a rental car. 
So, uh, where did you go to school? 
Choate, then yale, Then two years in africa with the peace corp. 
The peace corps. That's surprising. 
Oh, no, the peace corp. 
Lawrence peace's corporation. 
We drilled for oil in gorilla habitats. 
Oh, of course. 
I learned to talk to gorillas when I worked for ge medical. 
Uh, we're going to test poisons on you. 
Oh. 
So, uh, are you seeing anyone? 
Not for a few months. 
You remind me of him, actually. 
I have a thing for commanding salt and pepper types. 
I don't know why. 
I think it started when I walked into my parents Doing it the day reagan was shot. 
 I wouldn't overanalyze that. 
Hello. 
I am calling about the mad e- up conference call with geneva. 
I love having secrets with you. 
One time, I ran over an old lady in arizona And just kept driving. 
Yes. Damn it. Geneva. 
Well, cancel the conference call. 
I'm doing something far more important right now. 
And more beautiful. 
You're kidding, right? I mean, 
that's your move? 
 I  I beg your pardon. 
It's 3:30 in the morning in geneva, jack. 
Who's your call with? 
The hooker working the corner outside of raiffeisenbank? 
Oh, well, it is February. 
And in switzerland, that is night business month. 
 Okay. 
 All right, I'm sorry. 
I forgot who I was dealing with. 
Stay and just have another drink. 
Look at me, jack. 
Look how my body goes with this dress. 
I don't need to be dealing with amateurs. 
Listen, frank, I really need a ride home from the doctor On valentine's day. 
Are you free? 
No. That cleaning lady finally agreed 
To go out with me. 
We're gonna pick up some pierogies And then eat them at her husband's grave. 
you thought you were so much smarter than us, Didn't you? 
But now you're in the exact same Crappy valentine's day boat everyone else is in. 
No, I'm not. 
I just need a ride home, not a date. 
They're completely different situations. 
How's that? 
All we want on valentine's day is to know that someone cares Even a little about us. 
Aren't you lookivg for the same thing? 
In fact, yours is worse. 
If you don't get that tooth fixed, The infection will probably move to your brain And kill you. 
Yeah, well, if I die, my ghost is gonna haunt you. 
Then your ghost is gonna see Some disgusting stuff. 
Lemon, look at this. 
It's from avery jessup. 
Oh, it's set to the wrong time. 
It's set to geneva time. 
Last night, avery saw right through My conference call move. 
Today, she sent this. 
"hopefully you won't make the same mistake again, Mon sel et poivre. " 
That means "my salt and pepper" in swiss french. 
She's hitting the ball back, lemon. Game on. 
Wow. Avery jesvup. She's hot. 
She was on maxim's " I'd rape that 100." 
I know. And besides being beautiful, 
Avery is smart and doesn't suffer fools. 
And when I eventually seduce her, It's going to be... Very satisfying. 
Well, great. 
I hope you enjoy your weird game Of sexy one-upsmanship. 
Meanwhile, the male escort that I hired To take me home from surgery Has had a chlamydia flareup, so Uh, lemon, I wish I could help you, But I have to concentrate on avery. 
Uh, I need a big next move and you have a show tonight. 
I've invited her to be my guest at the tgs vip room. 
We don't have a vip room or vips. 
Get jon bon jovi. 
He's nbc's current artist in residence. 
What is that? 
i>- A not stupid program that I came up with. 
Bon jovi is under contract with us for a full year And scheduled to appear across a variety Of programming platforms. 
Okay, fine. I'll set it up. 
Thank you. 
Because tonight, she's going to get The jack donaghy "a" game. 
Ooh. She's getting the 
jack donaghy "a" game. 
Hope she can keep her clothes on. 
Lemon, your hair looks very nice today. 
You should wear it like that more often. 
 Oh, my. Well, II never, uh... 
Oh. Ma'am, is something wrong? 
 Maynard left me. 
 Oh. I'm sorry. 
Look at this. 
It's the first letter he ever sent me. 
"jenna, I was in your bedroom last night. 
I left a gift in your toilet. 
You will be my bride someday. " 
Oh. 
How can you be upset about losing a guy like this, Miss maroney? 
Look, I know it's crazy. 
Maynard is a weirdo. 
But that weirdo loved me unconditionally. 
You know what I realized? 
He's the longest relationship I've ever had. 
Except, of course, for doug. 
Please do not say what doug is. 
Doug is my vibrator. 
This is the worst valentine's day ever. 
Hello, this is elizabeth lemon. 
I have surgery scheduled tomorrow. 
And I am not embarrassed to tell you That I don't have anyone to pick me up And I will be leaving alone. 
Ma'am, you really need someone. 
i>- No, I don't. I don't need anyone. 
Because I can do every single thing That a person in a relationship can. 
Everything. Even zip up my own dress. 
Hmm. 
You know, there are some things That are actually harder to do with two people Such as... Monologues. 
i>- Look, if you really don't have anyone, You can sign a liability release, Then you can leave alone. 
I'll fax it to your office. - Great. 
Thank you for looking out for a sister. 
In a feminist way, not because you're black. 
Although it doesn't matter because I'm black too. 
No. You're gonna meet me. No, I'm not black. 
Thank you for setting all this up, lemon. 
Grizz, dotcom, thank you for pretending To be bouncers. 
Maybe some day we'll live in a world Where you ask us to pretend to be scientists. 
Jon. Thank you for coming. 
Oh, no problem, jack. 
What do you need, arena rock anthem, Power ballad? 
Actually, I have a date coming by. 
So if you can come over at some point and say hello, That would really impress her. 
Oh, sure. That sounds 
like an appropriate use Of my time and talent. 
Liz. The doctor's office 
faxed this to you earlier. 
Hey, when are you going to set up that cool Vip lounge? 
Thank you, cerie. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
You shouldn't sign anything without reading it first. 
I made that mistake once And I ended up nbc's artist in residence. 
Oh. Okay. 
Give me it. 
I have an honorary degree from monmouth university. 
Hmm. 
"I, the undersigned, "henceforce known as the alone, "hereby state that on February 14th, I have absolutely no one in my life. " 
You're alone on valentine's day? 
It's not about a date. 
I just don't have a ride home from the doctor's office. 
But isn't that the same thing? 
I mean, isn't it about having somebody out there Yeah, I get it, bon jovi, It's already been explained to me. 
"I, the alone, otherwise known as jane sadwoman, "release dr. Kaplan's office 
Of all legal responsibilities. 
"will likely die alone eaten by house cats. " 
Boy, this seems like a lot of unnecessary Forget it. I am not signing this. 
I reject the idea that there's some stigma To being alone. 
All rit, then what's the plan If you don't sign the release? 
I'll just tell them that my "boyfriend" Is gonna pick me up. 
And then after the surgery, I'll make a run for it. 
So you're going to invent a boyfriend On valentine's day? 
That is the lamest thing I've heard since... This. 
I'm tyke myson, baby boxer. 
I wrote that. 
I'm tyke myson, baby boxer. 
Hey, jack, who's this lovely-? 
Excuse me, bon jovi, I'm in the middle of a conversation here. 
 Yeah, but you said to  uh, thank you. 
 I hate it here. 
 Wow. 
That was a lot better Than your little conference call move. 
Can I get you a drink, avery? 
Or we could just get out of here. 
Yes. We could. 
Hello. Elizabeth lemon. 
Do you have your release? 
No, I don't need it because my boyfriend, Astronaut mike dexter, Will be picking me up... 
On his motorcycle. 
 Mm  hmm. Take a seat. 
* I will * * remember you * * will you remember me? * 
Oh. Oh. 
Ah. 
* * * * * * * that we had * * * maynard? 
* I will * * remember you * You know, I don't think the "anastacia" Actually "affectored" me. 
Oh, my god. What are you doing here? 
We knew you'd need a ride home. 
What do you mean we? 
You can't leave without a ride, dummy. 
Happy valentine's day. 
Oh, you have some dried blood on your teeth. 
You're here. 
You're all here because you didn't want me To be alone today. 
Oh, floyd, I still think every day About what would've happened If I had gone to cleveland with you. 
And even you, dennis, Watching the color purple drunk with you Was one of the funnest nights of my life. 
And drew, so handsome. 
So, so stupid. 
Seeing all of your beautiful faces And dennis' jean jacket, I know that I don't need anyone, But I do want to be loved. 
We all do. 
And if it didn't work out between us, It's just because I'm not finished becoming me yet. 
But I will find love someday. 
Because I am a sailor On the sea of the human heart. 
Okay, this bitch is tripping her ass off. 
Well, what do we do with her? 
I got a date tonight. 
I say we order us some pizza and lock her in here For the weekend. 
I'm gonna start dialing numbers Till somebody pick up. 
What's that, bon jovi? 
You love me too? 
Hey. You want to grab breakfast? 
You're sweet, jack, but let's not pretend This is anything more than it is. 
I'm sorry? 
Look, despite what happened in the shower last night, I'm a pretty traditional girl. 
I mean, I want a husband someday and a family And men like you don't. 
"men like me"? That isn't fair. 
I want a family. 
A son I can throw a ball to And when he's older, have power struggles with. 
Jack, you don't have to lie to me, okay? 
I love guys like you. 
You're great! For one night. 
Look, avery, I admit, this isn't What I was looking for going into this weekend. 
But you're an amazing woman. 
Lemon, I c-oh. You're kidding. 
Okay. I-I-I'll be right there. 
Uh, I need to go. 
Jack, the phone trick again? 
I mean, I'd be insulted if I wasn't so impressed By your assistant. 
This isn't a trick. 
I have to pick up a hallucinating employee of mine From the oral surgeon's office. 
Well, that's at least creative. 
Look, cancel your walk of shame. 
Come with me on a car ride of proof. 
oh, my god. 
Who did this? 
I don't know. 
I guess some weirdo out there loves you. 
Thank you, kenneth. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Happy valentine's day. 
What hotel is this? 
Uh, would you just keep an eye on her? 
I'm gonna turn down her bed. 
i>- I was sure he was making this up. 
Yes, you're a very pretty doggy. 
Hey, what do you think about jack? 
Who, jacky? He's the best one. 
I don't know what I would do without him. 
Yeah, he is pretty great, isn't he? 
bon jovi. 
 Um... 
 Uh, no, no, no, no, lemon. 
It's time for bed. It's time for bed. Yeah. 
 So you're... 
 In three weddings On the same day, yeah. 
Fate is telling us we're each other's Settling soul mates. 
I've been seeing someone else, And I think I'm in love with both of you. 
Jack wants me to stall? 
So I'm gonna marry... 
Japheth. 
And we're gonna live in... 
Nineveh. 
And I'm gonna be a... 
Prostitute. 
Yes, I continued to see other people. 
One person, who apparently you're also in love with. 
It's possible. Haven't you 
ever read Archie comics? 
Jack, I got divorced. 
I didn't know if you would ever leave mark, So I let myself fall into something else. 
You look amazing in that dress. 
You look like a gay mortician in that suit. 
You know, Kenneth, I have a thankless job. 
For example, I'm here on a Saturday To show around some Kabletown folks. 
Chk-chk! Boom! 
It's not real. 
Point is, I usually only get to deliver bad news. 
But not today. 
Kenneth, you are the new... 
Junior in-charge boy of the entire NBC page program. 
Oh, my goodness! 
This is my dream come true. 
And to hear it from my best friend in the whole world, Comma, bald category. 
Well, you start in two weeks. 
And they'll give you some moving money to help you get to L.A. 
California? 
I can't move out there And be away from all of you. 
No, thank you, sir. 
I'll pass. 
You can't pass. 
Jack put you up for this. 
If you don't want the job, you have to talk to him. 
Fine. 
I will talk to him. 
And Mr. Donaghy 
will understand 'cause he's my best friend in the whole world, Comma, beautiful hair category, parentheses, strong. 
 and a man must leave his mother   and a woman needs her bones  What can I say, Nancy? 
I want to be with you. 
I want to take naps with you. 
I want to watch you watch a hockey game. 
I want to find long red hairs in my overcooked pot roast. 
I love you. 
I do love you, Because you know that what I really am Is a poor mama's boy from Sadchester, Massachusetts Who had to wear his sister's hand-me-down corduroys. 
They were orange and had hearts for pockets. 
And you like me anyway. 
Yeah, I get it, Jack, But what are you gonna do about it? 
I can't share you with another woman Like you're that Mormon guy on HBO Who was in that Tornado movie. 
The one with the girl with the forehead Who was married to that Jewish guy. 
What? 
I'm a mom. 
Give me a break. 
I need to know right now, Are you in or are you out? 
In. Nancy, I'm in. 
Okay. 
Then I'm in too. 
 sum of all his parts   there is a love   Floyd and Kaitlyn   there is love...  
Paul? 
What are you doing? 
I thought you were going to get Your hair done for your friend's wedding. 
I was, but I forgot my bag of hair. 
Is this who you're into now? 
Cher? 
You're being another woman behind my back? 
It's not what it looks like. 
Oh, spare me your lame excuses. 
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, But when a girl dates a straight man Who impersonates her on stage for mostly gay audiences, She has certain expectations. 
Fidelity, Paul. 
It's not just the name of a bank that sued me. 
But I love you both equally. 
I don't know what to tell you. 
But you have to choose. 
It's her or me. 
Jenna, babe, wait. 
I'm sorry. 
That came out wrong. 
Mr. Donaghy! 
 Oh, God, Kenneth! 
 I need to talk to you About an urgent page-related matter. 
God, he came out of nowhere. 
We can talk on Monday. 
Ms. Donovan and I have an hour 
between weddings to, uh  Tickle each other like teletubbies. 
That's how I used to explain it to my kids When they walked in on us. 
But I don't want my promotion, sir. 
I want to stay here in New York with all my friends. 
I'm not going to let you say no, Kenneth. 
This is a promotion for you. 
And, yes, it's difficult, But today is about pulling triggers. 
It's about making bold choices. 
It's about  Two spidermans fighting, And sometimes they make weird noises, But they're not hurting each other. 
How often did they walk in on you? 
A lot. 
If you'll excuse me. 
D'oh, bother! 
Treble bother! 
What is it? 
My fancy dress slippers. 
I left them in my office. 
So go get them and meet me at Cerie's wedding. 
No. 
When I was fired, I vowed on the snipes name I would never set foot in there again. 
Also Kevin in security has a picture of me. 
So, what, you want me to go get your tuxedo shoes? 
See? 
Our minds are already one As our bodies soon shall be. 
There's the address. 
Of course. 
You work in insurance. 
Specializing in the transportation industry. 
Fulfills my boyhood passion for train accidents. 
Fine. 
I'll go get your shoes. 
Farewell, my luscious plum. 
 Oh, son of a  Why is your face like that? 
California? 
No way, Ken. 
Look, you got to tank this promotion. 
Do a sloppy job, and they'll leave you alone. 
That's how I got out of doing foreplay with Angie. 
And my taxes. 
That's not in my nature. 
If you've learned anything from me, It's how to do a bad job. 
Go. Honor me. 
Save yourself. 
But first get me a sandwich. 
Get it yourself, Chubbs. 
I'm on a coffee break. 
That's my boy. 
  Oh. I'm gonna hit 
the ladies' room real quick. 
You can never tell when one Of these non-denominational, goof-around weddings Is gonna start. 
 Jack Donaghy. 
 Paul l'Astname. 
I'm Jenna's boyfriend. 
Oh, I've heard a lot about you, Paul. 
Well, it's all true. 
I'm a native of Houston, and I love to cook healthy. 
And the female impersonator stuff. 
Oh, sure. 
Of course. 
It's actually been causing some problems at home lately. 
Do you think it's possible to love two women at once? 
I know it's possible. 
But at some point, you have to choose, Paul. 
You can't delude yourself with thoughts like, "what if I could somehow combine them into one perfect woman, Like a s'more you could take a shower with?" 
But how do you know if you've made the right decision? 
You don't. 
You'll always be wondering What your life would have been like If you'd opened that other door. 
Like at a haunted house sex party. 
Exactly. 
Thank you, Jack. 
Come on, Jessup. 
Get it together. No tears. 
Everything all right in there? 
I'm fine. 
Thank you. 
Here. 
You need this more than I do. 
I never put my mouth on it. 
 Thanks. 
 You look so familiar to me. 
Oh, I'm a financial reporter for CNBC. 
The hot box with Avery Jessup. 
No. You ever do a commercial 
for overshoppe.com? 
Oh, God, I did. 
Oh, that was before I got rid of my Maryland accent. 
Does the "o" have it? 
"o," we do. 
Do you "o"? 
"o," no? 
Let go. 
"o." 
Ugh. 
That accent's idiotic. 
Anyway, nice to meet you, Avery Jessup. 
I'm Nancy. 
Hi. 
I'm not normally this--ahem--overwhelmed. 
I-I came here to talk to my boyfriend Or whatever he is. 
I mean, this whole situation Clamp down, Jessup! 
Be a winner. 
Oh, my God. 
I can't drink this. 
You wanna talk about it? 
Oh, tuxedo slippers. 
Give me a break. 
Excuse me. 
I'm supposed to meet you here? 
Huh? 
Are you Wesley? 
I'm Carol. 
I'm sorry. 
What's happening now? 
I'm supposed to meet a Wesley About my insurance claim. 
Wesley doesn't work here anymore. 
Are you serious? 
I mean, I made the appointment, Like, a month ago. 
I rearranged my whole Saturday. 
Are you a doorman? 
Yeah, I'm a doorman... 
To the sky. 
I'm a pilot. 
Oh, okay. 
Well, look, it's a pretty standard workman's comp claim. 
I'm sure you could handle it. 
I was flying at 7:00 A.M. 
From Tampa to Louisville, And we had a two-hour weather delay, So naturally all the passengers got drunk. 
Generally speaking, if there's a delay Of more than 20 minutes, I might as well be driving a party bus. 
It's just idiocy. 
I don't know what's going on in this country. 
 I know. People wear flipflops 
to church. 
And the NBA tattoo situation is out of control. 
Thank you. Anyway, we're about 
a half hour into the flight, I hear this commotion behind me in the cabin, So I exit the cockpit, I go down the aisle, And to my left, I see A terrorist? 
No. I wish. 
It's a drunk lady. 
She's pulled her pants off, and she's ranting. 
She's complaining about the in-flight entertainment. 
So things got a little heated... 
And I had to implement sky law. 
 What's... 
 Sky law. 
It's when I put on the "fasten seatbelt" sign, And no one's allowed to move Till we've had ten minutes of silence. 
I made the whole thing up. 
But, you know, people are stupid, So they don't question it. 
That is awesome. 
So what is the workman's comp part of this? 
Eventually, I flipped the drunk lady off, She bit my finger. 
I know. 
It was totally unprofessional. 
But she was bagging pretty hard on my TGS. 
 What? 
 TGS. 
It's this late-night show on NBC. 
We run it in-flight when we're northwest-bound. 
Basically, the greatest thing ever on television. 
I don't stand for anybody besmirching it on my aircraft. 
Do you believe in fate? 
Wait a minute. 
Are you kidding me? 
You write for TGS with Tracy Jordan? 
I'm the head writer. 
I'm not an insurance claims adjustor. 
I'm just here because my cousin... 
Well, I mean, it's my favorite show ever. 
There's the one fart doctor sketch Where this fart doctor's trying to figure out who farted In the spelling bee, and he's like... 
"he who spelt it, dealt it." 
I wrote that. 
I write all of the fart doctors. 
I can't believe this. 
Would you like to go to a rich girl's wedding with me? 
I don't know. 
Does that sound like more fun Than me eating alone at the Laguardia chili's? 
I won't leave you, sir. 
No matter what it takes. 
Good afternoon, and welcome...Not. 
We begin our stupid tour Of this once-great network Outside studio 6h. 
Uh-oh. Ring-ring. 
Hmm. 
What's up? 
Nothing. Just giving a dumb tour 
to a bunch of uggos. 
Let's meet up later And smoke some drug cigarettes. 
You're a pilot, huh? 
I should pick your brain. 
I'm developing a daytime talk show with Sully Sullenberger. 
Yeah, I met that guy. 
He's not that great. 
You know what a great pilot would have done? 
Not hit the birds. 
That's what I do every day not hit birds. 
Where's my ticket to the Grammys? 
Hey, what took you so long in the bathroom? 
The usual ladies' room nonsense. 
Girl with boyfriend troubles. 
Someone forgot tampons. 
Everybody's bad at science and math. 
You know the drill. 
The ceremony will be starting soon. 
I'll get our table number. 
You get as many drinks as you can carry. 
I'll see you at the reception, Liz. 
Jack. 
Carol. 
Get ready for some of this. 
Later. 
He's here with you? 
Indeed he is. 
I see that Nancy is still here. 
You're welcome. 
 Smug 40yearold bridesmaid. 
What a treat for everyone. 
Yes, Lemon, I am with Nancy now. 
What made up your mind? 
Well, I decided that any decision Was better than no decision at all. 
Huh. 
I don't know, Jack. 
I used to feel that way too, but now I know. 
You can't force your fate. 
You just have to let it wash over you, Like a spray tan that won't take because your skin is too oily. 
That's absurd, Lemon. 
The world is made by those who control Their own destiny. 
It isn't made by those who don't do. 
It's made by those who do do, Which is what made me the man I am. 
I do do. 
Yeah. 
Grow up, Lemon. 
The point is I made my choice, and I'm not looking back. 
Period. 
Period. 
Avery Jessup? 
Son of a What did you do on your tour today? 
Those were the Kabletown executives. 
Our new bosses. 
Sir, I was just trying to do a bad job So I wouldn't have to go to Los Angeles. 
Everyone there smiles creepily all the time. 
And that's sort of my thing. 
Kenneth, you're not going To Los Angeles. 
Oh. 
Because they're making me fire you. 
You're fired. 
Ready? 
Here. 
This is yours. 
Oh, Nancy, I'm sorry. 
This is an embarrassing oversight. 
Jack, this morning at church, You told me all the reasons that you loved me, Some more graphic Than were appropriate for the setting. 
Now I want you to tell me What's so special about this other woman. 
Well, I like how she's less hot than you. 
I'm serious. 
What can I say? 
She's smart. 
She's pretty. 
She can tell you the Dow 40 in order of market cap. 
She knows how to field dress a deer. 
Why do you  Go on. 
Okay. 
Her laugh is like music. 
Really mean music. 
And she always wears high heels Because, according to her, flat shoes are for quitters. 
For God's sake, what can I say? 
You'd like her. 
So you weren't lying When you said you were in love with two women? 
 No. I wasn't lying. 
 Good. 
Then I feel a lot better about leaving. 
 What? 
 Avery's here, Jack. 
And she's pregnant. 
Oh, my God. 
This is crazy. 
Ah, it's fate. 
You were supposed to be a dad. 
And by the way, when I blew your mind last night, I was giving it about 50%. 
Unhand my fiancee! 
No, no, he's just a groomsman. 
And a Somali pirate. 
Careful. 
You tried to end our engagement With a textual transmission. 
Your behavior as a fiancee Has been as weak as American tea. 
There. I've said it. 
Our first argument, everyone. 
You're engaged? 
What if the bachelorette party theme was sluts? 
No, the engagement is off. 
You keep talking about how fate is trying to push us together. 
You know what, it is. 
But not to meet you. 
To meet the right man. 
His name is Carol. 
Like Carroll O'Connor from Nick at nite. 
Exactly, Cerie. 
Thank you. 
Carol is the one that I was fated to meet. 
And, yeah, I've only known him for a few hours, And maybe this sounds crazy, But I already feel like I could spend The rest of my life with him. 
He's the one that I've been waiting for. 
And someday, when Carol sees my disgusting foot secret, He's gonna be okay with it. 
I can tell. 
You were wrong, Wesley. 
We don't have to settle. 
The moms were wrong. 
Stupid buzz Aldrin was wrong. 
So thank you and good-bye. 
Praise to the universe. 
Love is real! 
Fine. 
It's your loss. 
There's only one Wesley snipes in this world. 
You know there isn't. 
How much of that did you hear? 
Well, you were engaged. 
Apparently you hate buzz Aldrin. 
Foot problem. 
And you and I are going to spend The rest of our lives together. 
I see. 
I'm sure you could get a cab on Houston. 
Yeah, I'm gonna depart. 
On time. 
I'm a pilot. 
Jack. 
Carol. 
 in your eyes   in your eyes   there is a light   in your eyes   in your eyes  Could you turn that down, please? 
 there is a light  Mazel Tov. 
I'm trying to tell you I want to get married. 
Oh, for God's sakes, Jack. 
What do you think, you're just gonna sweep me off my feet? 
This pregnancy is two years ahead of schedule. 
I'm suing dodecacil. 
I'm suing you. 
I'm suing this baby. 
You can't control everything, Avery. 
Sometimes it's just fate. 
Ugh. Is their gay juice 
in the champagne? 
See. 
I want you to teach our child How to say awesome stuff like that. 
 I would be a kickass mom. 
But if this is just you trying to do the right thing  No. I want this. 
I've always wanted this. 
But maybe it's too hard. 
The career, motherhood, Keeping it tight To stay camera-ready for breaking news. 
I mean, sure, Soledad O'Brien does it, but  I wipe the floor with that bitch. 
Let's do this. 
Love is patient. 
Love is weird and sometimes gross. 
Love is elusive, and you have found it. 
So treasure it. 
To Grizz and Feyonce. 
On behalf of Grizz and Feyonce, I'd like to thank Jack Donaghy For letting us have this reception here After the other location couldn't support the weight Of Grizz's extended family. 
Naturally, I blew it. 
Now I'm alone in a dashiki. 
I wonder what that Somali pirate's deal is. 
I could live on a boat. 
I don't even know where Paul went. 
I guess he made his choice. 
You know what? 
Forget men. 
We've got each other. 
Yeah. Let's go lez. 
No, I meant, like, a book club or something. Jeez. 
Right. Sisterhood. 
That's something we can count on. 
I'll never is that Paul? 
 You have a lot of taped-up balls To come here dressed like that. 
Oh, my God. 
If this is gonna work, Jenna, It can't just be all about you. 
 But... 
 No buts. 
I'm the man here, and you're gonna respect me. 
Yes, shma'am. 
Lemon, you know that's a young boy's puberty dashiki. 
Wrong, Jack. It's 
a warlord's concubine dashiki. 
Avery, you're here. 
I'm not surprised. 
Why should I be? 
And I'm pregnant. 
Also not shocking me. 
Reacting appropriately. 
Lemon, I think your pilot friend is looking for you. 
So? 
I thought he was gone forever. 
I guess I should go talk to him. 
Carol, what are you doing here? 
How did you get past security? 
You walk briskly in a pilot's uniform, You can go pretty much anywhere. 
I've been upstairs in the white house While the obamas were sleeping. 
I thought you had a flight. 
Yeah, I do. 
Those dirt bags can wait On the runway a couple more hours. 
I hate people too. 
Look, I'm 39 years old, I'm single, And lately I've been thinking there's a reason for that. 
I keep expecting people to be perfect, But nobody's perfect. 
Yes. Exactly. 
So if the worst thing about you Is that you give crazy speeches to fiances And maybe you have some kind of foot thing... 
That was a joke. 
I have medicine for it. 
Why don't we give this a shot? 
As long as you're not Jewish. 
I'm totally kidding. 
Yes. 
Let's do this. 
And honestly, Carol, I am a very normal person. 
Not a good time, guys. 
Liz, Cher and me, Paul, and I want to thank you for being a part Of our lives. 
And for encouraging us to be like this. 
I can't believe I'm meeting 1 1/2 Jenna Maroneys right now. 
Hi. Hi, there. 
Hi. 
 Carol. 
 Carol. That's a girl's name. 
It's a family name. 
Hey, everybody. 
I got fired today. 
You won't have Kenneth Ellen Parcell to kick around anymore, So I want to tell you people What I really think of you. 
 Hey, this ain't the  No. No. 
For four long years, I have listened to you all complain About your East coast media elite problems, Your apartment renovations, And your overpriced star wars memorabilia. 
That doorman is hammered. 
I have watched you Throw away better food Than my family eats at Christmas. 
And I have loved it. 
You people, you are my best friends, And I hope you get everything You want in life. 
Kenneth! 
So kiss my face! 
That was actually really sweet. 
I'll see you all in heaven! 
Have a wonderful summer!

Future Husband Lemon. 
When you were watching me after my oral surgery, Did I put a toaster waffle into my dvd player? 
You did. You watched it 
for about an hour, Said nicole kidman should get an oscar for it, Then you turned it off. 
Yikes. 
Thanks for babysitting me. 
I did my best, but you were pretty far gone. 
You kept trying to order home massages off of craigslist. 
good thing you were here. 
Hey, somebody order a massage? 
Oh, brother. 
you're too late! 
I already killed her! 
Well played, lemon. 
You went running? 
I thought you'd left. 
Who else is out there this early? 
Almost exclusively women that look like me. 
If the pervert community gets wind of morning jogging, god help us. 
Have you seen this? 
They keep talking about sheinhardt selling nbc To, uh, kabletown. 
That's never gonna happen. 
How could a company from philadelphia Buy a company from new york? 
That would be like vietnam defeating the United States In a ground war. 
I don't know, jack. 
My sources... 
Well, I'm telling you that don geiss and I Spoke about this, and that sale is dead. 
Look, I read his autobiography, Geiss cubes, whatever that means. 
It means the book is filled with cubes of knowledge. 
It's a good title. 
The principles in this book are timeless. 
I could open to any page... 
"because a woman's brain has fewer folds--" Okay, hang on. 
"the negroid musculature..." 
Nobody's buying anybody. 
Hey. 
Where is frank? 
He still hasn't rewritten the olympic sketch About the lindsey vonn who won the gold medal for skiing. 
Oh, mr. Rossitano called 
to say he overslept, And I should make up an excuse for him. 
So here goes On his way to work, he found some magic beans, And because he believed in them Ship up. 
Frank, frank, frank. 
What is this? 
"future husband"? 
Who did you put in your address book As "future husband"? 
I have absolutely no idea. 
Well, whenever I find something weird In my cell phone, I can usually trace it back To the last time I was drunk. 
Oh, my god, the dentist's office. 
Oh, your dentist gets drunk with you too? 
No! When I was 
under the anesthesia, I did a bunch of stuff I don't remember. 
 including meeting the man of your dreams? 
Oh, miss lemon, it's so romantic, Just like that movie I only saw the first ten minutes of, Fatal attraction. 
Liz, you have to call him. 
What? No. I was out of my mind 
on painkillers. 
I have zero memory of this guy. 
I don't know what he looks like. 
He could be a serial killer. 
he could wear a thumb ring. 
Miss lemon, you're such a pessimist. 
You know what my motto is? 
Everything always works out for the best. 
Watch this. 
I just threw my wallet out the window, But I'm not worried. 
Why? Because everything always 
works out for the best. 
I'm sorry. 
How is that supposed to make me call this guy? 
Be an optimist, miss lemon.

I already told you this morning. 
There's no deal. 
Oh, my god. 
You really don't know what's going on.

Rinse, please. 
Well, you're healing very nicely. 
You may continue to experience sensitivity for a few more days. 
When can I start eating hard cheeses again, doctor? 
I've had this pamphlet printed up. 
It was expensive, but I'm really tired Of discussing this with you. 
Huh. 
Dr. Kaplan, 
the last time I was here, I think I made a gentleman friend. 
But because of the anesthesia, I can't remember Where or how. 
Well, there was another patient In the recovery room with you. 
And I remember you were both laughing quite a bit. 
Okay. 
So, uh, who is he? 
What does he look like? 
He has some gum recession four pockets on 14 and 15, But, overall, very good teeth, especially for an englishman. 
Ooh, he's english? 
I've said too much. 
I really can't tell you anything about him You know, doctor-patient confidentiality. 
Ah, come on. I mean, 
you're not really a doctor. 
Well, if that's how you feel, Then you're not really a patient. 
And people who aren't patients Don't get toys from the treat bucket. 
But there's a batman in there! 
Yeah. 
And if you wind him up, he swims in the bath. 
Damn you, kaplan! 
Who's here? 
I need someone to be outraged too. 
uh... I'm here, miss Maroney. 
I actually slept here because my house keys are in my wallet. 
It wasn't to bad. 
Late at night these two little twin girls  told me they wanted to play with me forever. 
Have you seen this? 
Is that a macy's thanksgiving day parade pun? 
In March? 
It's a rave review... 
For tracy. 
It's as if claps-giving yay ha-rade Has lost all meaning. 
I did it. 
I'm a broadway star. 
Jenna, could you accept my tony on my behalf? 
June is a tough month for me Because I begin lifeguarding again. 
You know, renting a theater for one night And babbling on stage for an hour Five hours. 
Doesn't make you an actor. 
I don't know. 
People seem to like it. 
Well, it certainly doesn't get you a tony award. 
I know the tony rules, Because I've been petitioning for them to add a category For living theatrically in normal life. 
And I know for a fact you have to do your show A minimum of eight times to be eligible. 
Wait. 
The same show? 
of course the same show. 
But I can't do that. 
I'm a spontaneous actor. 
I never do the same thing twice. 
Action. 
Honey, I'm home. 
Pac-man, I'm jewish. 
Jeffrey, we lost the tournament. 
I can't do seven more performances. 
Well, then you better think of something else That starts with "t" for your little necklace. 
Do they give an award for tarantula misplacement? 
 jonathan downloads geiss' schedule   mr. Donaghy 
will be grateful   da-na-na   da-na-na   da-na-na  Oh, good morning, miss lemon. 
Still haven't found your wallet, huh? 
No. And I realized there was 
a prescription in there I should have filled yesterday. 
It keeps me from... 
Don't worry. 
It's just a donkey spell. 
Well, I went to the dentist yesterday, And I actually found out a little bit About my mystery guy. 
And? 
And I now know that he is english, And he made me laugh. 
That's wonderful, Even if he does come from a country That's nothing more than the dried husk america came out of. 
So are you gonna call him? 
And say what, that you're my future husband? 
I'd like to at least know what this guy looks like Before I put myself out there. 
Then we need to find a way for you to see him Through trickery. 
Kenneth. 
We all know deceit is okay if it's done for love, Like when lot's daughters got him drunk To repopulate the world through incest Or when screech went to the masquerade ball in disguise So lisa would kiss him. 
This is wesley. 
this is nurse jamakiah From dr. Kaplan's office. 
So here's the ting. 
You need to come in today So the doctor can check dem teeth, mon. 
Oh. 
Is there something wrong? 
My checkup isn't for another week. 
He tinks dat tooth might have some bad mojo in it, ya see. 
 might you be available to come in Around 1:30, me lad? 
you're going irish. 
Okay. 
1:30 is fine. 
Cool runnings, mon. 
Bobsled. 
 see? 
Miss lemon, I told you. 
Everything... 
Stay away! 
I will bite you! 
Jack, what brings you down to news? 
Hey, cnbc, nightly news rules. 
Go break a story, williams! 
Nightly rules. 
Avery, I have some information for you, But in exchange, I need you to do something for me. 
Okay. 
I told you last night, no. 
Why would you even want to braid my hair? 
Because it's romantic, and I'm really good at it. 
But this is strictly professional. 
I saw don geiss' schedule, and you're right. 
There is something going on... 
And I know where. 
This is jack welch's address in connecticut. 
But don geiss was seen last night At the ritz-carlton in philadelphia. 
Decoys. 
Or he could have driven back by now. 
Oh, thanks for the tip. 
In return, here's how you're gonna report it. 
Geiss fights off buyout, keeps company intact, Makes this gesture. 
Jack, I can't do that, Because this deal is happening, And if don geiss is fighting it, You should start distancing yourself from him. 
Distancing myself? 
That man is my mentor. 
He taught me how to command a room with my voice! 
Back to work. 
All I'm saying is, the writing's on the wall. 
Do you think it was easy for me to cut ties From my old mentor, pat o'brien, after he shaved his mustache? 
So this is what you do to people You use them, and then you throw them aside? 
That is not fair. 
This is not about us. 
This is about us. 
I came here asking you to help me. 
And I'm trying to help you. 
Being don geiss' guy just became a liability. 
I spent the last 30 years trying to be that guy. 
Well, you're never gonna be, 'cause no one is! 
That world doesn't exist anymore! 
 you're making me sound just like my mother! 
Someone like you couldn't possibly understand. 
Jack. 
I'm going to connecticut. 
I'm gonna stand by my man, Which is the song that I sang to don at his promotion dinner. 
Excuse me, miss maroney. 
Would you be interested in going to mr. Jordan's show tonight? 
I know he could use your support. 
I don't think so. 
If I wanted to see a black guy make a fool of himself, I'd have sex with k-fed again. 
I'm just worried mr. Jordan may not egot. 
He has no idea what he did in his show last night. 
And without my wallet, I don't even have my lucky rabbit spine. 
I don't know what's gonna happen. 
I'll tell you what's gonna happen. 
It's gonna be a disaster. 
The man is not an actor And has no business being on the stage. 
Why, with a curtain five hours from now, It would take the greatest acting coach The world has ever seen to make his show a success. 
Fine, I'll do it! 
Sign in. 
We're running behind today. 
We'll be with you as soon as we can. Bobsled. 
This is wesley. 
Hello? 
  Can you tell me why you come up on my phone as future wife? 
Would you like to get coffee? 
Mine was actually an infection in the right rear molar Caused by some loose bristles from an off-brand toothbrush That I had to buy over christmas, 'cause my mom threw away my old snoopy one. 
Wow, this is not interesting. 
I don't know what caused my root-canal situation. 
Well, british people have notoriously bad teeth, So... 
I've never heard that. 
Really? 
You've never heard people make jokes about british teeth? 
None of the brits I know have a situation with their teeth. 
Well, it's just a thing people say. 
Like when they say older women have bread back. 
What's bread back? 
A loaf of back fat between a woman's bra And her giant underwear. 
No, that's not a thing. 
People don't say that. 
Not to you, no. 
I think we're getting off on the wrong foot here. 
It's turned into a bit of a situation. 
You use that word too much. 
Both: So any siblings? 
Wow. 
God. 
Mr. Welch, it's good 
to see you again. 
Please, john, call me jack. 
I actually go by jack as well. 
I don't think so. 
Well, I'd like to talk to don. 
I know he's here. 
He is here. 
But he's dead. 
what? 
He died three weeks ago. 
The company wanted to keep it quiet Until the deal went through, so I've been Hiding him in your freezer, Just like we did with hiram sheinhardt During the rca deal. 
Look, I know how much don meant to you, And if you need to pass some eye water, I'll be happy to go out and get you some weakness tissues. 
No, I'm not crying in front of jack welch Neutron jack, and I'm not giving up. 
Don geiss wanted this company kept intact. 
And these people are from philadelphia. 
Let it go, john! 
It's over. 
Miss lemon, how did the dentist's office go? 
Did you meet wesley? 
I did meet him. 
We even went out for coffee. 
And? 
And it was a disaster. 
We were so awkward that the waitress gave us Separate checks without asking. 
And a priest came over and asked us who we'd lost. 
But it has to work out. 
Does it? 
Do you have your wallet back? 
Did I find my future husband? 
Sometimes everything is just the worst, kenneth. 
Jack? 
It's over, lemon. 
It's all over. 
What? 
What's wrong? 
Don geiss is dead. 
Oh, my god. 
They're selling nbc to a company called kabletown, With a "k." 
Oh, yeah. 
My parents have kabletown down in pennsylvania. 
It's a fine and generous company. 
My dream, the dream I've had since I was a child, is gone. 
I'll never be the ceo of the general. 
Oh, jack, I'm so sorry. 
Will I still be able to turn in old cab receipts, Or do you think I'm sorry. 
I don't know what to say. 
Maybe you should talk to avery. 
I don't know about avery anymore. 
She's probably distancing herself from me as we speak. 
I'm alone. 
I'm the protege of a dead man At a company that no longer exists. 
Wait. 
Did you hear that? 
That's the sound of me being erased from contact lists All around the world. 
Yeah, well, I hear something else. 
It's the hug plane coming in for a landing. 
You're cleared for approach. 
Acting is about consistency and control. 
Got it--no farting. 
I'm gonna teach you the skills That will allow you to perform your show every night. 
Let us begin with elocution. 
Repeat after me. 
After me. 
No, tracy. 
No, tracy. 
No, stop it. 
Not this part. 
No, stop it. 
Uh, we got to start over. 
I farted. 
To sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock Awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp shock. 
To sit in darkness in a sharp, sharp shop In darkness and sitting in the sharp. 
This is stupid. 
This is not stupid. 
These are the building blocks of the craft of acting Something I have dedicated my life to Ever since my very first job as baby stuck in well In a commercial for well guards. 
Well guards Guard your well... 
Well. 
I remember that commercial. 
You were a fat baby. 
Well, maybe we're just gonna have to agree To disagree on the acting process. 
You have no process. 
Acting is the discipline of being someone else At all times. 
I don't know. 
When I'm acting, I just do me, And people seem to love it. 
Well, then I guess you don't need my help. 
Go out there and be yourself. 
Go onstage and read the damn phone book for all I care. 
What are you gonna do, mr. Jordan? 
Do you think you can repeat your performance? 
Your performance. 
Liz... 
Do you work here? 
Yeah. 
Remember, at coffee, You said you hadn't seen the show, But you'd heard bad things. 
Uh-huh. 
What are you doing here? 
I'm supposed to meet kenneth parcell. 
I found his wallet. 
What? 
You must be my wallet angel. 
No. 
This is not possible. 
But it is. 
I knew my wallet would turn up. 
And it did. 
No, kenneth, this is wesley from the dentist's office. 
Oh, my goodness. 
This is the guy from the dentist's office. 
He found my wallet. 
I'm either very happy right now, Or I'm having a pretty bad donkey spell. 
I'm okay. 
It'll pass. 
This is crazy. 
I guess we have to give it another shot. 
I guess we do. 
Dinner tonight? 
Perfect. 
Do you like tex-mex? 
No, I don't. 
See you there. 
The fcc will now investigate This large-scale, multimillion-dollar sale To kabletown. 
And now the $5.6 billion question 
Who will take the reins Of the cable giant's new acquisition? 
According to my sources, the clear frontrunner Current g.E. Executive 
jack donaghy. 
The people I'm talking to say he's the only guy out there With the programming experience, business savvy, And piercing blue eyes of a siberian husky That the job requires. 
I'm told donaghy was instrumental In making this deal happen, and I spoke to him earlier. 
He refused to speculate but did say, and I'm quoting here, "I'm going to celebrate by buying my lady friend "that necklace she pointed out And then cooking her a western omelet." 
End quote. 
And then I'm gonna braid your hair. 
jack donaghy's office, Please hold. 
Jack donaghy's office, please hold.

A breakfast date? 
Who is this guy? 
Uh, I met him on kdate, Which is the personals section of the kraft foods website. 
And what was he like? 
He owns a cockatiel named Arliss. 
Oh, God. 
But I'm not letting it get me down. 
I'm just gonna keep putting positive energy out there, And something good will come back to me. 
Good morning, Miss Lemon. 
A Mr. Debarber called. 
Seriously? 
A Mr. Debarber called. 
Floyd called. 
Oh, my God. 
That's amazing. 
What you said worked. 
Okay, universe, Send me a white football player No kickers or linemen. 
 30 Rock 4x16  
Floyd Hey, Danny, congratulations. 
Congratulations? 
For what? 
Danny was nominated for a Juno, Which is like a Canadian Grammy. 
Yeah, I recorded the psych up song that plays During Ottawa Senators games. 
 the crowd's getting loud   scotiabank place   make a hockey-loving face   at scotiabank place  I'm not gonna win, but it's an honor just to be nominated In the same category as Sir Dave Coulier. 
Well, it should be great exposure for ya. 
I know! And there's gonna be 
a profile of me In the New York Times as filler because of dwindling ad sales. 
Isn't that awesome? 
I am sick of that guy's positive energy. 
We got to start messing with him. 
Yeah. Like, what if 
we trick him into kissing me? 
It'd be so funny because I'm not gay. 
Or if the pranksmen write that times profile ourselves, Making Danny look like an idiot. 
And put it in the press packet That everybody gets. 
This is the most friends I've ever had. 
Kenneth, I'm having a Tracy and Jenna problem. 
Gosh, Mr. Hornberger, 
You say that so often, You should come up with a shortcut word for it, Like, "ivatrennapra." 
Well, Danny's interview with the New York Times Comes out today, so "ivatrennapra." 
A what? 
If Tracy and Jenna hear about it, They'll get jealous and act out, And as much as I want to, I can't slap the brat out of them. 
So Tracy and Jenna will spend the day in the makeup room, Having full plaster impressions made of their faces. 
So that should shut them up for, uh, let's say, 12 hours. 
Oh, my, that's a long time. 
Maybe I should keep them company. 
Yes. 
Tell them your stories. 
They'll hate that. 
Silly Mr. Hornberger. 
Always saying hate when he means love. 
Hello, Floyd. 
It's Liz. 
Thank you for calling me back. 
We have so much to catch up on. 
Yeah. So how are you? 
Oh, my God. 
You're not gonna ask me what's wrong with my voice? 
I was being polite. 
 look, Liz, I'm sorry I haven't called In a while, but I'm in New York for a couple days, And I, uh I'd really like to see you. 
Wow. Great. 
Okay. 
Um, just tell me now if you've grown a goatee. 
No, no, no goatee, Just chola eyebrows. 
So are you free tonight? 
Uh, I have to work late. 
Can it be tomorrow night? 
Yeah. I mean, I'd love 
to see you sooner than that, But, you know, whatever works. 
Okay, well, I'll call you tomorrow. 
Okay, perfect. 
Uh, I got to run. 
Call me. 
Ciao. 
Uh. 
I don't know how this happened, Jack, But it's bad. 
I think I really screwed up. 
With a female page? 
Don't worry. 
they disappear all the time. 
No, I did an interview for the New York Times, And they printed all of this stuff that I didn't say. 
Typical liberal media. 
That's why I get all my news From Dick Cheney's website dickviews.Com. 
I never said that Liz banged her way to the middle Or that Jenna kidnapped a Swedish au pair To use as a hair farm, And I never called Tracy clean and articulate. 
Why would I? 
He's not. 
This stuff is in the newspaper, Jack. 
Everyone's gonna see it. 
No, they're not. 
It's a hoax. 
What? 
The New York Times doesn't have a staff writer Named Seymour Nips. 
You've been pranked by the nerds. 
My guess is this is the work of Frank, the black one, And... 
Lutz. 
The writers why would they do that to me? 
Because they look at you, and you're everything they're not. 
You're handsome. 
So are you, Jack. 
I wasn't fishing, but thank you. 
Danny, we will not let this stand. 
Well, then what are we gonna do? 
I'm no stranger to the art of japery. 
At Princeton, I was in a secret society. 
I shouldn't tell you this, But one time we snuck up to Dartmouth, Put their mascot in a box, And sent it to Mexico City. 
We didn't know until the next day That it was an actual indian. 
He didn't speak a word of english, Like all Dartmouth men. 
All right, I'm game. 
Let's team up. 
What should we call ourselves? 
What's the most handsome animal? 
Both: The silver panther. 
Guess who called me? 
The boob job recall center? 
No. 
Floyd. 
We're having dinner tomorrow night, And I don't know what it means, But I am allowing myself to be excited. 
I mean, on the phone, it was like We were just right back there, Liz and Floyd. 
Liz and who? 
Come on. Floyd. 
My ex-boyfriend, the only good boyfriend I've ever had Recovering alcoholic, he used to work in this building. 
Oh, you mean that guy? 
And, of course, this is our other finalist couple For the today wedding contest, Floyd and Kaitlin. 
Whahk? 
An old Gus is the biggest catfish in the pond. 
Legend has it, the only bait That'll catch old gus is a piece of old Gus himself. 
So everytime they catch him, they cut off a litlle piece of him so they can catch him Now how did the very first person catch old Gus? 
Well, that's a story for another time Right now. 
So if my grandfather hadn't gotten On the wrong train that day, He never would have met his wife's murderer. 
I wonder what hawaii's state quarter's gonna be? 
Nobody knows. 
But here are several hundred guesses A pineapple, a coconut... 
  Uh, Lemon, could I have your weakness files On Frank, toofer, and lutz? 
Floyd's getting married, maybe on the today show. 
  Floyd never told you? 
I mean, "b"s before "h"s, but that is low. 
This sucks, Jack. 
I know that I'm a sour person, And I don't like a lot of people, But I liked Floyd. 
And I guess in the back of my mind, I thought we'd end up together someday, That, you know, the whole thing would turn out like a movie Where christopher cross sings a song like,  all my days, I've been waiting   for you to come back home   in the moonlight   of New York city  Lemon, I'm sorry. 
We all have our romantic pipe dreams. 
I thought that nancy would leave her husband for me, And it's not going to happen. 
They're boston irish catholic they mate for life, Like swans, like drunk... 
Angry swans. 
vote for Floyd and Kaitlin. 
I love this woman. 
Oh, my God. 
I can hear him on the plaza. 
Hey, keep it down out there! 
This isn't Liz. 
Okay, it's bad enough that he is getting married, But does he have to do it right outside my window? 
No. He cannot win 
this contest! 
Lemon, I know you're hurt, and I know that look, But don't even think about revenge. 
You are not a silver panther. 
What are you talking about? 
Just stick to the high road. 
The low road is a slippery slope. 
 I know, Jack. 
Believe me. 
I mean, it's like, on tv, it used to be You couldn't say crap, and then they let that slide. 
And now we can say whatever we want Douche bag, asswipe. 
Anal rot. 
Exactly. 
So I'm simply gonna ask Floyd, As a friend and former intercourse companion, To do me the favor Of not getting married right outside my window. 
I'm gonna meet him tomorrow night at mcshanley's for dinner. 
Mcshanley's? The place 
where you got food poisoning From the fish three times? 
So? 
So are you sure You're not planning to get Floyd sick And sabotage his chance of winning? 
What? No, Jack, that never 
even occurred to me. 
Then you'll never be a silver panther. 
I don't care. 
I'll start my own group. 
Rejection from society is what created the x-men. 
So to get there, you start on old barn road. 
Then you take the first left, then the next left, Then the next left, and then another left. 
That'll take you around the quarry, Which is real pretty. 
I just wanted you to see it. 
That'll put you back on old barn road. 
What do you got there? 
Have you guys seen this? 
We are getting a report from right here At rockefeller center that there is a toxic gas leak In the building. 
Whahk? 
The type of gas is unknown, But it is triggering the building's autolocks. 
What is happening? 
Oh, my God, what do we do? 
What do we do? 
I know a way out! 
What's wrong? 
So much of my life Have I wasted putting things on hats! 
We are now getting reports that the toxic leak has created What police are calling a Cloverfield type monster In the building. 
The monster cannot detect the smell of human skin. 
Anyone still inside should disrobe immediately. 
I'm keeping my hat on. 
I don't care, man. 
Get them off, Lutz. 
Get your shorts off. 
Gentlemen, I wanted some Of the tgs dancers to see this. 
Now we're even, guys. 
As you were, nerds. 
Surculus et pruna. 
Surculus et pruna. 
Now, I don't have a lot of experience Reading stuff out loud to people, So I'm gonna do this the most normal way I can think of. 
Space, space, space, space, space, Space, my autobiography, space, space, Space, space, space, by Kenneth Ellen Parcell. 
Space, space, space, space, space. 
Thank you. 
Good morning, ladies. 
Mm-hmm. 
Good morning. 
Liz, last night I had a very graphic dream about Kenneth. 
What? 
Ugh! 
I know. 
It's disgusting. 
But Tracy and I had to listen to Kenneth talk For hours yesterday. 
He must have gotten into my subconscious. 
And then I dreamed that he and I I don't want to hear it. 
La la la la! 
 da da, no  Good morning, Mr. Jordan. 
Oh, good morning. 
Lemaroni, Something horrible happened to me last night. 
I had a dream that Kenneth and I got intimate In a portable jacuzzi. 
It was crazy. 
Glistening black and white skin It looked like a close-up of a killer whale being born. 
He got me too. 
It was horrifying. 
Now I never want to go to sleep. 
Just like this amazing city that we live in. 
I knew it. 
Surculus et pruna is the motto Of the twig and plums. 
And your motto is, "above all, be boring." 
Listen to me. 
Twig and Plums is a Princeton secret society, And Jack is clearly a member. 
So? 
So they have all kinds Of weird rituals and rules, Like if someone says "twig and plums" In front of a member, he has to find an excuse To leave the room, no matter what he's doing. 
What? 
But during the period Of the '90s... 
Twig and plums! 
Thank you, folks. 
Excuse me, I have tickets to a Harry Connick Jr. Concert. 
Jack messed with the wrong fat losers. 
Yeah! 
This issue is time-sensitive, so hear me out Before the overseas markets... 
Open for the day. 
Twig and plums. 
Excuse me, gentlemen. 
I have a, uh... 
Veterinary appointment. 
What's up? 
How you guys doing? 
Do you want to split some mozzarella sticks? 
I saw you on the today show. 
Damn it. 
I could have sworn you watched the early show on CBS. 
The early show? 
What am I, in a hospital? 
I'm so sorry, Liz. 
You know, I just wanted to tell you everything face-to-face. 
I did not mean for you to find out about Kaitlin on tv. 
Believe me, if I had a time machine, I would go back and do it differently. 
You want to split some mozzarella sticks? 
Aagh! 
I didn't go back far enough. 
Look, I-I want you to be happy, And obviously you have a life to live, But your getting married is a big deal to me. 
So please, don't do it where I work. 
And don't drag my best friend, tv, into it. 
No, I get it. 
I do. 
But I'm sorry. 
I got to do this. 
Look, Kaitlin is a yogaerobics instructor And an ab model. 
I was in a reenactment On America's Most Wanted once, Playing a lady strangled on the toilet. 
We're just hoping the exposure can help Kaitlin Get some jobs here in New York. 
Here in New York? 
Wow. 
Let's just order. 
I'm sorry, Liz. 
No. 
Don't be. It's fine. 
High road. 
So are you seeing anyone? 
You should try the fish! 
What would you like for dinner, Mr. Jordan 
Barbecue or me? 
No! 
No! 
Are you all right, Tracy? 
I had another freaky ken-mare. 
It's okay. 
We're gonna get through this... 
Together. 
No! 
 I just had another Kenneth dream. 
Me too. But how do I know 
this isn't a dream? 
Wait a minute. 
All my teeth are loose, so we're good. 
It's real. 
Tracy, my dreams are getting worse. 
This one was so graphic. 
Kenneth and I were married and living in Indianapolis. 
We had kids. 
What kind of sick mind dreams that? 
It was disgusting! 
We have to get him out of our dreams. 
We have to go back to how things were. 
Are you thinking what I'm thinking? 
Both: We have to Elm Street this. 
We have to go to sleep and kill Kenneth in our dreams. 
I don't know who the hell told you To say that, rossitano, but you have no idea Twig and plums. 
I have to go to an intervention For my... 
Travel agent. 
So that's your second salmon. 
How are you feeling? 
Like a rock star. 
Hey, excuse me, can I get another salmon, compadre? 
Sauce on the side again, please? 
Eating healthy, 'cause I'm marrying a lady That keeps it fit you know, nice and tight. 
You know... 
 kapow! 
Yeah. 
Are you okay? 
Hmm? Hells, yeah. 
Yeah, I'm great. 
 shot through the heart  whoa-oa! 
 and you're to blame  This is my jam right here. 
 you give love a bad name  ooh, my jam-a-lam. 
Mm-mm! 
  So another Jack-glazed salmon. 
And anything for you? 
Wait, what is Jack glaze? 
It's our special sauce that we put on the salmon. 
It's molasses and honey and Jack Daniels. 
It has alcohol in it? 
No, no, he doesn't drink. 
Oh, don't worry. The alcohol 
cooks down with the fish. 
But what if you get the sauce on the side, And it isn't cooked with the fish? 
That would explain why we have so many drunk kids here. 
 angel's smile...  
oh, what have I done? 
This is the slippery slope. 
There's alcohol in that sauce. 
You've been drinking alcohol. 
Trying to get me drunk? 
Squeeze in one last ride at six Floyds Amusement Park? 
Well, we're closed. 
Sorry. 
No, Floyd, I just wanted you to get food poisoning To mess up your Today show thing. 
Look, you're drunk. 
It's my fault. 
Let's get you back to the hotel. 
No, I would never do that to you Get you drunk on salmon or any fish! 
I thought we cared about each other. 
Yeah, I did too. 
I thought the only thing keeping us apart Was that you wanted to live in Cleveland, But you'll move to New York for Kaitlin. 
Yeah, I will. 
You know why? 
One, blonde. 
Two, she's alive... 
Like a deer. 
She runs and sniffs and jumps and stares. 
She's not like the badger With its glasses and its rules about weekday sex. 
Those are good rules. 
People have work in the morning. 
How are you still single, Liz? 
There's so many guys out there That want to be poisoned and yelled at. 
Yeah, well, uh, have a good night. 
Enjoy your salmon. 
Salmon for everyone... 
On me. 
This is a dream. 
You're in control. 
Why? I considered you 
a brother. 
Aah! 
It's working. 
We've joined forces in our dreamscape. 
Now we fly. 
What the hell are you doing? 
Uh, controlling our dreams? 
We can explain, Pete. 
We were just trying to Elm Street Kenneth. 
Unbelievable. It is 
way too early for this, guys. 
I haven't even had my first cup of wine today. 
Tracy, it's morning. 
We slept all night, and we didn't dream about Kenneth. 
We're cured. 
It worked! 
It's a miracle. 
No, I got in a lot of writing Who's that from? 
That's my mom's room. 
Hello, Frank. 
I think you know where I am. 
I just happened to run into your mom At a T.J. Maxx in Queens, 
And we came back here for some cannoli and red wine. 
She's a lovely woman. 
I'll be leaving soon. 
I'm a gentleman... 
As is Danny. 
Hey, Frank. 
Your mom's a hugger. 
Don't push me, Frank. 
You won't enjoy the next tape. 
Your mom might, though. 
And I believe toofer and lutz also have mothers. 
Do we understand each other? 
Pranksmen... 
Stand down. 
You wanted to see me? 
Lemon, have you seen the today show this morning? 
Why? 
Floyd showed up, right? 
Funny you would ask that, but, yes, he showed up. 
The problem is, he won't leave. 
In this hour, spring cleaning Boring! Boring! 
Floyd, come on. 
Hey, you guys wear so much makeup, you know that? 
You do. 
Floyd! Have you been drinking? 
Shut up, kit kat! 
Vote for Floyd and Kaitlin! 
Yeah! 
Right? 
Oh, God. 
Mm. 
Ah, false alarm! 
Saved it. 
All right. 
He got drunk with me last night, But it was an accident. 
And he was being a wang. 
I didn't think he would go on a bender. 
Lemon, you have to fix this. I know. 
This is not the high road. I know. 
Shut up. 
Kaitlin, you have every right to be furious at me. 
What I did was unconscionable. 
And I-I didn't have a lot of time, But to make it up to you, I hope That you'll accept these tgs mouse pads And a man's wallet with the Dateline logo on it. 
I'm not mad, Liz. 
This is a relief. 
I thought he'd gone off the wagon 'cause of me. 
No. Even drunk, he only had 
really nice things To say about you and your butt. 
God, I don't remember any of that. 
Did I fall down while I was with you? 
'cause my lower back is killing me. 
Oh, boy. 
Floyd, I am so sorry. 
No, Liz, there's a reason I quit drinking. 
You know, I-I probably would have left me there too. 
I really just want you to be happy. 
You too, Liz Lemon. 
So go. 
Get married. 
Love each other. 
And if you go on a cruise for your honeymoon, May it be free of pirates. 
Outie 5000. 
Liz, look, well, maybe this is crazy, But I don't have any female friends Because, you know, my body. 
And I was just wondering... 
And now I have agreed to do a reading From corinthians at Floyd's wedding. 
So instead of avoiding seeing Floyd getting married... 
I'm in the wedding party. 
Yeah. 
I've had enough of both of you. 
Your bad behavior stops now! 
Absolutely, sir. 
We promise. 
And we are never, never taking you for granted again. 
In fact, we'd like to sing you a thank-you song. 
Thank you, Kenneth. 
Oh, I'll show you how to thank me. 
  Let's do this. 
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. 
Wake up. 
I'd like to welcome everyone to this NBC employee town hall meeting. 
And thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules. 
Yeah, I'm supposed to be drinking a soda right now. 
A special thanks to those joining us via simulcast, Particularly you gentlemen in the Tokyo office. 
I know it's late there. 
I don't know why you're wearing girls' pajamas, But I'm sure it's cultural. 
I'm here to address concerns regarding the acquisition Of our company by Kabletown. 
With a K. 
This is an exciting time for NBC. 
Not Seinfeld, Friends, E.R. 
exciting. 
More like 3d episodes of Merlin exciting. 
But I believe this is a great opportunity For all of us because Kabletown is a great company. 
Even if it is from... 
Philadelphia. 
Go Eagles! 
How did you even get a snowball? 
Philly rules! 
Cheesesteaks! Bobby clarke! 
Will Smith! 
Your town sucks. 
You do not want this argument, Lemon. 
Boston is the greatest city in the world. 
Boo. 
Boston tea party. 
Boston cream pie. 
Boston Rob Mariano. 
Birthplace of Benjamin Franklin. 
Yeah, then he looked around, realized it sucked, And moved to Philadelphia! 
Oh, did you just whip a battery at me? 
Mr. Donaghy, I'm sorry, 
can we get back to the meeting? 
Of course. My apologies 
to our friends  from the great city of Los Angeles. 
Hey. Stop laughing. 
L.A. Rules. 
Michael Bay, freeways, Legoland. 
Before I take your questions, I'd like to say few words about Don Geiss. 
The world has lost a giant. 
He built G.E. 
into the greatest company on earth, And the earth into one of the top three planets In the universe. 
For those of you wishing to pay your respects, There will be an episcopal cryogenic freezing service Open to all six sigma black belts and higher. 
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. 
Episcopal! 
Now the floor is open to questions. 
I would be remiss if I didn't honor our fallen leader With a song. 
This is for you, Dan Goose. 
 amazing   gra- 30 Rock 4x16 
Don Geiss, America and Hope So how was your second date with Wesley? 
Ah, well, you know that scene in Notting Hill Where they have the romantic date in the garden? 
Well, I would have rather watched that terrible movie Five times than have hung out with Wesley. 
So he's not your future husband? 
He's not my future anything. 
You gave it a shot. 
Good riddance. 
Nope. 
I'm seeing him tonight. 
You are? Why? 
Well, this morning I was buying an advanced ticket For the truffaut retrospective At the anthology film archives One for the 8:00 hot tub time machine. 
Liz? 
Are we both seeing hot tub time machine tonight? 
How does this keep happening? 
If there is a god, liz, I think that she... 
Ugh. 
Is trying to tell us something. 
It's like the universe keeps pushing us together. 
We can't shake each other. 
I had a thing where I kept running in to michael douglas. 
But then I realized it was just some old lady Who lives in my building. 
Lemon. A moment. 
We have a Tracy problem. 
Okay. 
Escaped exotic animal Or did he swallow another firecracker? 
I wish. 
Our old nanny wrote a tell-all book about me. 
Oh, no. 
It's bad. 
I just got the call from a friend at little brown. 
The publishing house? 
No, the premier talent agency For black dwarves. 
Tracy, we need to start doing damage control on this. 
What does she reveal in the book? 
Everything. My addiction 
to prescription glasses. 
The fact that I suffer from attention deficit disor Jack, your shoes are shiny. 
And worst of all, she revealed the fact That I've never cheated on my wife. 
Okay, well, that's not true. 
Actually it is true. 
Tracy shared that with me last year. 
What? 
What about the strip clubs And the disgusting stories? 
Your ben & jerry's flavor is called adulteraisin. 
That's all for show. 
I love my wife and only her. 
Okay, and how is that a bad thing? 
My wild and sexually adventurous image Is how I make my money, Liz Lemon. 
I start losing my endorsements, Angie's gonna be madder Than a bat in a suitcase. 
Uh-oh. 
Which reminds me. 
Gordon. Gordon. 
Gordon! 
Oh! 
I'm sorry. 
You have a problem With the science of hot tub time machine? 
Not the time travel. 
It's the hot tub. 
You don't just turn one on, and it's immediately hot. 
I should know. I've been 
in a hot tub two times. 
Well, I don't question everything. 
Except for the snacks I got for us. 
Yeah. 
Seltzer and Mike and ikes. 
What did you want? 
Popcorn? 
Yes. 
Popcorn? At the cinema? 
And, by the way, your food obsession Is not as endearing as you think it is. 
It's like being in a cathy cartoon That just won't end. 
Oh, my god, I want to smash your face. 
I don't think we were meant to be together. 
So why are you in my phone as future husband, and why am I in yours as future wife? 
I guess we'll never know. 
At least we'll always have Dr. Kaplan's recovery room. 
It was our Paris. 
huh...to bad we can't go back there. 
Look at all these books, sir. 
Feel like I'm back at school learning about the dangers of book readin. 
This is all research on Kabletown. 
I'm trying to learn everything I can about our future owners. 
G.E. gave me the finest 
education know to man. 
I learned to develop new products, innovate new technologies. 
We brought good things to life. 
and bad things to Chinese Rivers. 
G.E. is a great company. 
Second only to the company of great friends. 
I thought I would workphone at G.E. forever. 
But my future opportunities at the company died With Don Geiss, I have to accept that And move on to this exciting new challenge. 
A friend of mine has been worried They'll be bringing in new page rules. 
Like age limits and age verification. 
Truth be told, I haven't learned a lot About Kabletown. 
It's a whole different business model. 
My cousin in Atlanta is a business model. 
She holds up staplers in catalogues. 
But later today, I'm meeting with an old colleague Who left G.E. For Kabletown 
five years ago. 
I'm going to pick his brain and learn how Kabletown works,s, So I can prove that I am the man With the ambition, the talent, And the looking-at-my-watch skills to run this company. 
terrific, sir! 
So all we need you to do Is to put us under anesthesia again. 
Wesley brought his video camera. 
In England, we call it a film pod. 
No. 
And that way, afterward, we can watch the tape And figure out what our connection was. 
Would you ask a cardiologist to do something like this? 
I am a real doctor. 
Yeah, but a cardiologist is... 
I know what a cardiologist is. 
My brother is a cardiologist, and I'm just as good as he is. 
We drive the same car. 
So what if his wife is more attractive? 
But Dr. Kaplan, 
this is for love. 
It's like that brilliant film, uh, Notting Hill. 
I'm british and charming, and she's... 
Got certain angles that work for her. 
Really? 
You think you found "the one" In my recovery room. 
Let me show you what happens in there. 
We are gonna hang out so much after this. 
I want to take you to the big apple circus 'cause we're best friends. 
I don't think there was any connection. 
It was just the anesthesia. 
Well, liz, I wish you all the best. 
But future wife deleted. 
It's a good idea. 
And if my heart surgeon brother is so great, How come so many of his patients have died, But I've only killed one guy, huh? 
Say it ain't so, tray. 
What about the Seattle Seahawks cheerleader? 
That one kind of thick rockette? 
That blind woman In the business class bathroom on the acela? 
Were those all lies too? 
But, Frank, I still party. 
I'm still terrible at my job. 
I looked up to you. 
Now I hate you. 
Tracy, I know what you're going through. 
I got a lot of flack After I ate the pig that played babe. 
I learned you have to go on the offensive. 
Start denying this stuff. 
I did, j-mo. 
I held a press conference this morning. 
I'm here to announce that I'm leaving show business To spend more time with my stripper. 
But it's like a black barbie doll in Arizona. 
Nobody's buying it. 
Well, we lost another one, tray. 
I just got off the phone with the people From horny goat weed. 
They're dropping you as their spokesman. 
But John Edwards and I were supposed to ride On their cinco de mayo float. 
Yet another black superstar Taken down by his personal life. 
Just like my favorite golfer OJ Simpson. 
Remember how you tricked the owner Of that toaster company into thinking You were his dead son? 
And he sold you the factory for $1. 
You are an animal. 
Dave "the animal" hess. 
I was only as good as my mentor, The man who taught me how to bait the enemy, Jack "the master baiter" Donaghy. 
So, dave, tell me all about Kabletown. 
What's their business strategy, revenue streams? 
Do they have a preferred side of the head For parting your hair, because I've been continental For years, but I'm willing to go western. 
Whoa, relax, buddy. 
Your job is secure. 
I just want to understand the operation So I can contribute right away. 
Well, that's the beauty of it, Jack. 
You don't have to. 
The cable's already laid I don't understand. 
There's always room for growth, For innovation. 
No, there really isn't. 
It's brilliant. 
And this is the goose That lays the golden eggs Channels 500 through 600. 
Oh, good god. 
Ass-atar. 
The lovely boners. 
The hind side. 
Fresh-ass: Based on the novel "tush" by assfire. 
It's all pay-per-view porn. 
Do you know how much of our profit Comes from men ordering adult movies? 
91%. 
They churn this stuff out, People at home push a button, And we make money off it. 
We don't do anything. 
Then what do you want with NBC? 
Why do you even want me? 
Well, buying NBC counts as a charitable donation For tax purposes. 
And as for you, You're the classic american executive. 
You will look great Standing behind our ceo at press conferences. 
You are kidding me. 
I went to Harvard business school. 
I'm the reason the microwave tray rotates. 
Jack. 
I make things. 
I build companies, innovate products. 
Don't fight it, Jack. 
It's the perfect business. 
The war is over, and we won. 
"and Alexander wept For there were no more worlds to conquer." 
Hans Gruber, Die Hard. 
Hey, I know you're off-duty, But is there any chance you would take me To the upper west side? 
Okay. 
Oh, good catch. 
Thank you so much. 
ow. 
in foreign language] Bloody hell! 
No, no, no, not again. 
That's not him, is it? 
Okay. 
That was almost Gangway for footcycle! 
Come on! 
I said gangway for the... 
you witch! 
No, no, I am walking away. 
Wait, Liz, wait. 
Look, I wasn't even supposed To ride my footcycle home today. 
Stop calling it that. 
Yeah, fine, my velocipede, but I did ride it Because the universe wanted me to run into you again. 
And I finally think I know why. 
Commencing eye-roll sequence. 
The universe wants us to settle for one another. 
Well, there has to be a reason This keeps happening to us, Liz. 
I think fate is telling us This is the best we're ever gonna get. 
We're each other's settling soul mates. 
Settling soul mates? 
That is grim. 
And I've played Monopoly alone. 
Well, I know it's not ideal, But we'd both benefit. 
I mean, I could open jars and kill bugs for you, And you could make me look less gay at work functions. 
Look, I happen to believe in roma Don't even say romantic love. 
How many couples do you know that are actually in love, That don't completely annoy one another? 
Okay, what about them? 
You wouldn't be complaining If you wore the shoes I bought you. 
You're an old bitch. 
Why fight this? 
Grow old with me, Liz? 
In separate bedrooms? 
No way. 
Have a nice life. 
Think about it, Liz. 
It's what the universe wants. 
You'd have someone to tell you When you're about to step in something. 
Ah, nerds! 
Okay, mentor time. 
I need a pep talk. 
Lemon, I'm not in the mood to solve your lady problems Or listen to a story about whatever escapee From the island of misfit toys you're currently dating. 
No, this is a Liz relationship emergency. 
It's a Liz-aster. 
Okay, Lemon. 
What is it? 
 okay. 
Ever since I was little... 
No, faster than that. 
My whole adult life... 
No! 
Oprah says... 
You have ten seconds. 
Okay, this guy Wesley Thinks we should get married Because it's time for us to settle. 
Now that's completely and totally wrong because... 
Is it? 
Maybe you should settle. 
Everybody settles. 
What? 
Look at me. 
At one point, my obituary was going to read, "CEO of G.E. dies violently 
in a casino orgy." 
Now what's it going to say? 
"middle manager of a Philadelphia Pornography distributor never wakes up"? 
What are you talking about? 
Kabletown. 
It's a mousetrap company. 
And you cannot build a better mousetrap. 
Wait--Kabletown makes mousetraps? 
Kabletown doesn't make anything. 
Maybe it is the perfect business. 
A perpetual motion machine endlessly satisfying Every human need. 
Soon you won't even have to leave your house. 
That sounds pretty good. 
They don't need ideas, They don't need innovation. 
In other words, they don't need me. 
Wait, where are you going? 
I'm going to bury Don Geiss, America, and hope. 
hey. 
I saw some women came forward to say You didn't have sex with them. 
It's gotten worse. 
Somebody leaked my voicemails. 
Hey, baby, it's your husband. 
So I'm at Bed Bath & Beyond, And I can't remember, Did you say to get metal or wood shower curtain rings? 
Oh, you're calling me on the other line. 
I can't wait to talk to you. 
I love you. 
How does angie feel about this? Is she mad? 
She says I better have an affair and quick Before it tears our family apart. 
I wish I could help you, But I can't sleep with a black guy. 
I'd lose my endorsement deal with NASCAR. 
That's the problem. 
Who's desperate enough to have sex with me At this point? 
Come on. 
You're still Tracy Jordan. 
There's got to be some skank around here Who's made it very clear she wants you. 
Go save your career And give her the thrill of a lifetime. 
Hello, Elizabeth. 
May I offer you a succulent fruit? 
What? No. 
Why are you in here? 
Let me do a dance for you, my lover. 
No. 
No, this is wrong. 
I can't have sex with you, Liz Lemon. 
I love angie too much. 
Wow. Okay. 
That was not gonna happen for many reasons Besides you loving your wife. 
Reason one: I am conscious. 
Reason two: You smell like icy hot. 
Reason three I'm sorry, L.L. 
I know how much you wanted this to happen. 
I'm disappointed in me too. 
If I can't have an affair, Tracy Jordan is finished. 
Stop it. 
Just embrace the fact That you are lucky enough to be a happily married man. 
I mean, I'm actually jealous of you. 
You've got stability, a great marriage, Devoted kids. 
You know what I have? 
A sims family that keeps getting murdered. 
So quit whining and be grateful. 
I am lucky. 
Thanks, Liz Lemon. 
You're welcome, Tray. 
Hey, you know what, one day you will have what I have Because you're an amazing, strong, and intelligent woman Like Hilary... 
From Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. 
Thank you. 
That's a very good pep talk. 
Ugh! 
I'm sorry. 
I was still riding the vibe from earlier. 
  Welcome, all, to the memorial service/freezing For Donald H. Geiss. 
You were the last of a dying breed, sir. 
I'll never forget the first thing he ever said to me. 
"these are all hookers. 
Pick one." 
Then after we picked our hookers and the plane took off, He told me his business philosophy. 
There's always an untapped market. 
Don was the one who realized there was a whole segment Of consumers not buying light bulbs. 
The asleep. 
That realization led him to develop the nightlight And the marketing campaign aimed at making children Afraid of the dark a monster under every bed. 
Don said that no business is ever done evolving. 
But there are always opportunities for innovation, That you can always... 
You can always find new customers. 
I'm sorry. 
But I just had an amazing business idea. 
You'll have to excuse me. 
  I know it's not my place yet to call a meeting Of Kabletown senior vice presidents, But I have something I need to share with you. 
Gentlemen, there is a giant segment of consumers Who are not buying our most lucrative product. 
Three words: Porn for women. 
Jack, women hate porn Almost as much as men hate going to outlet malls. 
Yes, women hate porn. 
Our porn. 
But women do have one insatiable need. 
To jabber. 
And it doesn't matter if you have a headache, Or you're not in the mood, Or you're about to go to Don Geiss's funeral, They barge right into your office And start complaining about a boyfriend Or a coworker. 
And you're supposed to sit there and nod And tell them they're right. 
And the more you give it to them, the more they want it. 
I'll tell you, sometimes my wife will be blathering on About something, and I'll think, I'm more than just a pair of ears. 
You know, I'm a person Who thinks about sex every seven seconds. 
Exactly. 
So what if women had a pay-per-view channel Featuring handsome men patiently listening to them? 
What if they had... 
Porn for women? 
Okay, but where does that content come from? 
From us. 
We make it. 
Jack. 
We don't make... 
Hear me out. 
Yes, I'm talking about Doubling pay-per-view profits While cutting out the middle man, but I'm also talking About american businessmen doing what they were born to do Make things. 
We've stopped making And become a country of consumers. 
Well, I, for one, am done consuming. 
And I'm ready to make. 
Liz? 
I don't believe it. 
Hello, Wesley. 
Don't you see this is just gonna keep happening? 
You can't fight the universe. 
No, this isn't a coincidence. 
I wanted to see you, and I figured You wouldn't miss a tasting of the white wines of Scotland. 
Most restaurants refuse to serve them. 
Oh, yeah, you've only told me that, like, nine times. 
So does this mean you've come to your senses? 
Are you ready to settle and become Mrs. Snipes? 
No. I wanted to tell you 
to your face That I know that I can do better than you. 
And I am never gonna be Mrs. Snipes. 
Hang on, is your name Wesley Snipes? 
That is insane! 
No, it's insane That the actor Wesley Snipes has that name. 
If you saw a picture of him and a picture of me, And you were asked, "who should be named Wesley Snipes?" 
You'd pick the pale englishman every time. 
Every time, Liz. 
Frankly, you should be having this conversation with him. 
Yeah. 
I'm gonna go do that. 
I give you two months before you give up And decide to settle! 
I'll see you in May! 
For sweeps! 
That's what we call spring cleaning in England. 
Hello there. 
Well, hello. 
How was your day? 
Do you need to talk? 
'cause I'll just listen patiently and say things like, "uh-huh," "how annoying," "she's clearly jealous of you," And "well, it's his loss." 
You're a great woman. 
You deserve a great man. 
For just $24.95 an hour. 
Yes, please. 
It's the yellow button, sweetie. 
﻿1  Your hair's looking less weird. 
 Thanks. 
Okay, Christmas gifts. 
Uh, Pete? 
Well, he keeps telling me that he wants skinny jeans, so Cheese of the Month Club. 
Uh, Jenna? 
Oh, I wanna take that Internet photo of her nipple slip and have it made into a jigsaw puzzle. 
Aw, she'll love that. 
Okay, uh, Jack? 
 Jack donaghy? 
 Yeah. 
Huh. 
Well, I've never exchanged gifts with Jack before. 
But we've known each other four years. 
 I mean, we're friends, right? 
 Absolutely. 
You guys remind me of that bantering couple in that old movie, um... 
Meet the parents. 
Oh, my, is it yearbook time already? 
The company has acquired an up and coming social networking site called YouFace, so each executive has to set up their YouFace page. 
 Now, this picture will be my pholo... 
 Not a word. 
Which is a contraction for photo and hello. 
Youface. 
Who are you facing? 
No one. 
Those sites are for horny married chicks with kids who want to exchange pervy emails with their old high school boyfriends. 
And since all your high school boyfriends  Are now gay  exactly. 
So Lemon, what can I do for you? 
Do you want to exchange Christmas presents this year? 
 Uh, just, uh... I would love to. 
 Great. 
 So what do you want? 
 Excuse me? 
Well, in my family, everybody just writes down what they want and then we give it to each other and everybody has a great Christmas. 
Lemon, gift giving is the purest expression of friendship. 
I'm going to think about what I know and like about you and that will lead me to the perfect gift, and you do the same. 
So bath salts in a coffee mug would be... 
Not it. 
Season 4 Episode 8 Secret Santa    Thanks. 
 Hey, new guy, how's it going? 
Well, I'm worried. 
 I haven't been on the show the last two weeks. - Good stuff. 
Listen, every Christmas, I collect money from the staff and give it to the cleaning ladies. 
 Yeah. Of course, count me in. 
 Great. 
 Jenna, would you care to chip in? 
 No, thank you. 
I'm doing my own thing this year. 
She does this every year. 
She doesn't give the money because she knows that the card says, "From the cast and writers of TGS", and she'll get credit for it anyway. 
I should make up new cards that say, "Happy holidays from everyone except Jenna." 
But that would require me to have some remaining life force, Danny. 
So I'm gonna go have a drink alone at the Oyster Bar. 
 I've been finger tagged, Lemon. 
 Was it down by the subway entrance? 
'cause I saw a gangly-looking kid down there. 
Finger tagged means I have been contacted by someone else on YouFace. 
In this case, that would be Nancy Donovan, the cutest girl at East Sadchester High School, class of 1976. 
That's the year my mom was born. 
Would you get us some pens? 
See, I told you you'd find an old girlfriend. 
She wasn't my girlfriend, Lemon, But I must admit, Nancy Donovan was... 
My first crush. 
My first crush was Larry Wilcox. 
The blonde guy from Chips? 
Bowl haircut, thin lips, hoo. 
Uh, this wasn't a TV crush. 
This was real. 
Oh, mine got pretty real. 
Here's a woman I haven't seen in 25 years. 
One day on YouFace and she finds me, tells me that she's coming down to pick up her sons at fordham, and she'd love to swing by. 
 What does that mean? 
 Did she post you public or PM you? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, let's look at her page. 
Oh, um... 
 Got it. 
I'll check her face-vault to see her previous bing-bings. 
 Is YouFace hyphenated? 
 Huh. 
Six months ago, her status said she was "married," but 14 days ago, she changed it to "working on it." 
 Really? May I see that? 
 Nope, do not put a hyphen in YouFace. 
There are definitely faces here but they are not being treated with respect. 
Ew. 
Kenneth. 
Bag of names. 
Secret santa. 
Secret santa! 
Kenneth is doing his secret santa fun swap thing. 
Ugh! 
He takes the two worst parts of Christmas, giving and rules, and combines them! 
And then the person with the highest number gives the smallest gift to the tallest person. 
If they wanna switch, they cannot, unless they do. 
Then everyone puts their head down except the murderer. 
Oh, wait, that's not right. 
The whole thing was so confusing I ended up getting my own crappy gift back. 
Like I need two copies of Over 60 Vixens. 
Mr. Rossitano, 
Would you like to participate in our studio-wide secret Santa fun swap? 
I totally would do secret Santa, but I don't believe in Christmas because I'm a Verdukian. 
Yes, we are all very strict Verdukians. 
Oh. My apologies. 
I've never heard of that religion. 
 What do you all believe in? 
 Oh, many things. 
Uh, the healing power of root beer... 
That a man can have up to nine wives if two of them are male. 
And we always leave work to go to the movies on Merlinpeen. 
So good Merlinpeen to you, Kenneth. 
 Good Merlinpeen. 
 Good Merlinpeen. 
Vattene, what's this? 
Is this a store Jack likes? 
Unbelievable. 
Do you really think you belong on Mr. Donaghy's personal gift list? 
Why not? 
We're friends. 
He's the best gift giver in the world. 
I tried once. 
I bought him a $95 bottle of olive oil. 
In return, he got my sister out of a North Korean jail! 
 Oh, brother. 
 You will never match him. 
And I'll be here next year to take you off of that list. 
Even if I get into law school, I won't go! 
All right. 
Jonathan, would you... 
Oh, Lemon, come in here for a minute. 
I want you to meet my old friend, Nancy Donovan. 
That's my maiden name. 
I keep tellin' ya. 
Things have changed. 
But not your hair. 
It's like a shag carpet. 
I wanna sit on it and play a board game. 
 Nice to meet ya. 
 Nice to meet you. Is your family here? 
Ah, just the boys. 
My husband couldn't make it. 
Husband couldn't make it. 
Oh, I...I brought something to show ya. 
It's, uh... it's goofy, I know. 
Oh, my goodness. 
Hey, Beantown. 
Hey, Beantown was the school musical Nancy and I were in. 
I thought you had stage fright. 
 hey, beantown   the puritans found you  Both:  hey, beantown   water surrounds you   so let's watch the sox play ball  Both:  play ball   at beantown, you got it all  Whoo! 
Yeah, I did plays in high school too. 
I was John Proctor in The Crucible. 
 Oh, you went to an allgirls' school? 
 No. 
Jack played Paul Revere. 
We were all jealous of Lisa Alberson 'cause she got to play his horse. 
 Well, nice to meet you. 
 Nice to meet ya. 
 He still owes me $10. That's true. 
 Yeah, he was always a thief, that guy. 
Remember those guys used to hang out by the cash register? 
 Oh, I know. I remember. 
 And mooch. He was a moocher. 
What's with all the junk, Ken? 
Well, these are my all-inclusive holiday decorations. 
Here's a little Christmas tree... 
 Okay. 
 A menorah. 
 Dig. 
 A picture of President Obama. 
 For the muslims. 
 I'm gonna let that one slide. 
And a bowl of meat cubes with a picture of Jimmy Connors sticking out in the tradition of Verdukianism. 
Verdukianism? 
That doesn't make sense. 
Jimmy is catholic. 
Ah. Good Merlinpeen, gentlemen. 
All: Good merlinpeen. 
So you guys are Verdukians? 
Yep. That's why we 
can't do secret Santa. 
Mm-hmm. 
Then sing that Verdukian winter carol. 
The famous one. 
 oh, meat bowl of verduke    you bring me such pizza    meatbowl  Now a Christmas song. 
Oh, Mr. Baker. 
Hmm? 
 oh, holy night   the stars are brightly shining  What the whaaat? 
New dude is as good at singing as Tracy Jordan is at everything! 
Danny, was that you? 
Why didn't you tell me you could sing like that? 
 I didn't think it was important. 
 Not important? 
I had Tracy playing Josh Groban last week. 
Come here. 
Listen up. 
Jenna's not singing the Christmas solo on Friday's show, you are. 
What? 
Why? 
For the most wonderful reason of all: Christmas vengeance. 
Jenna will finally be punished for all the times I had to pay her share of the money for the cleaning ladies. 
No, I don't wanna steal Jenna's solo. 
That's not what the holidays are about. 
Maybe Jenna and I could do a duet instead. 
Yes. A duet. 
Share the stage. 
She will love that! 
I'm sorry, are you being sarcastic? 
Canadians have a hard time recognizing it 'cause we don't have a big Jewish population. 
I'm not being sarcastic at all! 
Okay. Great. 
Dude... 
Merry Christmas, Pete Hornberger. 
I can't believe you're not married. 
I thought you'd have some hotshot young wife with black hair who says queer stuff like, "dressing on the side." 
Well, I was married, but people grow apart. 
Was she a bitch or did you cheat? 
 The former. 
 The former? 
What are you, a newscaster? 
Whatever happened to your Boston accent? 
You're a liar, Nancy Donovan. 
I never had a Boston accent. 
What about you, loudmouth? 
What southie piece of trash did you trick into marrying you? 
I'll have you know that my husband happens to be a very prominent Pakistani anesthesiologist. 
No, I'm kiddin' ya. 
He's an Irish moron. 
Runs a roofing company. 
So if you need your roof done, call someone else, Because my guy's... 
Not reliable. 
What do you say I take you and the boys out to dinner? 
 I know a lot of terrific places. 
 Uh, I don't know. 
They have their heart set on the ESPN Zone. 
They've been talking about the Hideki Matsui Caliente Fajitas all week. 
Well, let them go to the ESPN Zone and I'll take you someplace nice. 
Yeah. Sure. 
Why not? 
I'm glad we, uh, never made out in high school. 
Otherwise this whole thing would be so awkward. 
Excuse me, we kissed every night on stage in Hey, Beantown. 
Oh, that doesn't count. 
There wasn't even any tongue. 
But only because my mother told me that French kissing was for the Italians. 
They do love it. 
How else do you think I got Mr. Sorrentino 
to cast me as the spirit of liberty? 
A duet? 
Really? 
I didn't know you sang. 
I mean, it's funny 'cause it's kind of my thing. 
But next thing I know you're gonna be telling me you're really blonde and have a urinary tract infection. 
Maybe I should hear you sing. 
That way I can plan our harmonies. 
 oh, danny boy   the pipes   the pipes are calling   from glen to glen   and down the mountainside   I'm sorry, is your nose bleeding? 
 Yes. 
Because I'm so happy for you. 
It's definitely not a rage stroke. 
Oh. Great! 
 What's up, special K? Having a party? 
 Not me, sir. 
Tonight is the Verdukian holiday of mouth pleasures. 
Misters Rossitano, Spurlock, and Lutz must have free sausage pizza followed by some gentle flossing performed by a blonde virgin. 
Your generosity is being taken advantage of. 
 What do you mean? 
 Verdukianism. It's fake. 
Those dudes made it up because they didn't wanna do secret Santa. 
But they had all these rules and rituals. 
That's what religion is, K-fed. 
Just a bunch of made-up rules to manipulate people. 
Why don't Catholics eat meat on Fridays? 
I'll tell you why. 
Because the Pope owns Long John Silver's. 
Wait a minute, are you saying that other religions are made up by man too? 
Uh-oh, Ken. 
We may have fallen into the intellectual deep end here. 
And if you try to grab on to me, we'll both drown. 
 What if there's no God? 
 Okay, time to go. 
  So far, she's just uploaded some pictures. 
"My Christmas trip to New York with the boys." 
Ice skating, sure. 
And Nancy cupping Burt Reynolds' crotch at the wax museum. 
That finger touching his moustache is me. 
Why did she crop me out of all of these pictures? 
No, it's good. 
If Nancy didn't care about you, she'd leave you in. 
But she must feel weird about her husband seeing you there. 
 She feels weird in a good way. 
 Weird in a good way. Huh. 
Like going to the gym drunk. 
She changed her status from "working on it" to "weirdsies." 
O.M.F.G. 
 Is that maroon and navy? 
 Nerds! 
Don't tell me, Lemon, you spent $500 on a tie I already have at a store with a no returns policy. 
Oh, shark farts! 
But this is my lucky tie. 
And anyone who knows me well would know that. 
And just like I know you only wear that sweater When you're planning on eating pasta with red sauce. 
 Nice haircut. 
 Let's level the playing field. 
How about the most we can spend on each other's gifts is... 
zero dollars? 
 Really? 
 You want to exchange creative gifts? 
Oh, well. 
You are the one that's in trouble now, buddy, Because creativity to me is just like... 
It's like a bird, like a friendly bird that embraces all... 
Ideas and just, like, shoots... 
Out of its eyes all kinds of beauty. 
Wow, Lemon, this is like watching Hemingway write. 
Mark Hemingway. 
Yeah. 
Wait, why are you wearing your lucky tie? 
I'm having dinner tonight with Nancy. 
Alone. 
She changed her status to "weirdsies." 
What are your expectations here? 
She's married. 
Uh, I don't know, Lemon. 
Nancy's leaving tomorrow. 
Can't I just enjoy this while it lasts? 
That's what I said when that hot dog vendor passed out, But you made me go get help. 
Hey! 
Did you hire this guy to hide in my dressing room and punch me in the throat? 
 No. 
 He's bigger than you said. 
May I still collect my kiss? 
Vattene! 
Why would you do that, Jenna? 
I thought we were buddies. 
You don't fool me with your innocent act. 
First you force your way into my solo... 
I didn't force anything. 
Pete is the one that wanted to take away your solo. 
What? 
Why? 
He's mad that you don't chip in for the cleaning lady's Christmas gifts. 
Well, I'm doing my own thing. 
I got them this. 
The program from this year's Asian women in television awards. 
Julie Chen's energy drink, Chenergize. 
A flipvideo. 
Wait, hang on, I didn't know this was in here. 
Wow, you really get in the Christmas spirit. 
Oh, my God. 
I just got sarcasm. 
Fine. 
I'm terrible at Christmas because I never had a nice one. 
Sometimes my mom would take us to see Santa Claus, But that's just because she suspected one of them was my deadbeat dad. 
So I'd have to get on every santa's lap in the Bakersfield area and scream, "you oughta be ashamed of yourself, Travis!" 
Oh, no, that's... 
that sounds horrible. 
And then I'd sing carols in the middle of Sears just to create a distraction while my mom shoplifted. 
And those few minutes when I was singing carols, that was the one part of Christmas I liked. 
And now you've taken that away from me. 
Well, that went well. 
Oh, yes. 
You're just a Kenny Rogers doll now. 
Something you wanna say? 
We wanna do secret santa! 
Yay! 
Secret Santa has been cancelled because I have lost my faith. 
But something's changed in us. 
It's... it's a Christmas miracle. 
That certainly proves God exists. 
If God existed, then he would punish you for what you did to me. 
And yet here you are unpunished. 
Ergo, our actions have no consequences. 
So if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go buy some guitar music. 
Hey, what was the name of that abandoned factory where we used to go shoot bb guns at rats? 
Wolford Cap and Gown. 
Of course. 
Is that still there? 
No, they tore it down and put up a big playground. 
 Oh, what a shame. 
 Yeah. 
 So, uh, can I buy you a nightcap? 
 Better not. 
We have an early train back to Boston tomorrow. 
And you know how hard it is to get teenagers out of bed in the mornin'. 
Yes, but not in the way you're talking about. 
It was great to see you, Jack. 
I'll, uh... 
I'll hit ya on YouFace. 
But you gotta promise me to finger tag me back. 
I'd like nothing more. 
What is this? 
This is your zero dollars present. 
 doo doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, my friend is Jack   if you like his necktie, pat him on the back  Nope. Never mind. 
Not your present. 
Uh, no, please. 
Don't go. 
Uh, I'm sorry that I wasn't even able to feign interest in whatever that was. 
Nancy left this morning. 
She'll be on the 12:10 out of Penn station. 
Do you ever wonder, Lemon, what your life would be like if you had never left your hometown? 
Oh, of course. 
Have you not read my terrible short story, The two paths of Virginia apple? 
I spent my whole life trying to erase where I came from. 
But after these moments with Nancy, for the first time in my life, I'm homesick. 
Well, you'll stay in touch, right? 
I don't know. 
Nancy's going back to her husband, her life. 
I think this was just a moment in time and I just wish it had lasted a little bit longer. 
Okay, well. 
I'm gonna go work on your real gift. 
You know what would go real nice on that wall over there: A drawing of a frog. 
 No. 
 No. 
No. 
Back in five, four, Three, two... 
 frosted window panes   candles gleaming inside   painted candy canes on the tree   santa's on his way   he's filled his sleigh with things   things for you and me   it's that time of year   when the world falls in love   every song you hear seems to say  Both:  Merry Christmas   may your New Year's dreams come true    Hey, Jack. 
My train got cancelled. 
I spent all day at Penn station trying to get out. 
Figured I should finally take the hint and meet ya for that drink. 
Well, I'm glad you came back. 
And I figured I owed you a kiss good-bye. 
I mean, what's the big deal? 
We did it every night in Hey, Beantown. 
We'll just do it high school style. 
No tongue. 
 and this song of mine   in three-quarter time   wishes you and yours  Both:  the same thing too  Merry Christmas, Lemon. 
The gender blind Crucible. 
Framed in wood from the stage of your high school theater. 
Jonathan had to drive all over Pennsylvania and I did not reimburse him for gas. 
Zero dollars. 
Thank you, Jack. 
That's amazing. 
And don't worry about my present. 
I already got the greatest Christmas gift you could imagine. 
Nancy came back to say good-bye. 
Her train was cancelled. 
Because somebody called in a bomb threat to Penn station? 
You're welcome. 
Merry Christmas. 
All right, which one of you are Frank Rossitano and James Spurlock? 
 That's us. 
 They are we. 
 You're under arrest. 
 What did we do? 
Someone called in a bomb threat from your phone this morning. 
I renounce Verdukianism! 
What's that mean? 
Are you Al Qaeda? 
Come here, pal! 
Watch the head! 
My angry God is punishing them. 
It's a Christmas miracle. 
 and this song of mine   in three-quarter time  Both:  wishes you and yours   the same thing too  Both:  merry Christmas to you   Are you Larry Wilcox? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
This evening, you have permission to call me officer John Baker. 
Oh, but, uh, no sex stuff and no touching my gun. 
Of course, yeah. 
Merry Christmas, Lemon. 
Okay. 
Hee hee hee! 
Wait, how is this zero dollars? 
Well, he promised to get me on Dancing with the stars. 
But that's on ABC. 
Donaghy! 
I never thought this day would come, lizzie. 
Okay, push. 
Push, liz lemon! 
Here comes your baby! 
Congratulations. 
It's meat cat! 
the cheesy blasters mascot. 
I'm what's inside ya! 
Razzmatazz! 
I got to eat better. 
Oh, hello, mr. Hornberger. 
I thought I was the only one here at this hour. 
No, this is just my little ritual, So I can have a moment of peace and quiet Between home, where this happened, And work, where... 
I'm always being interrupted. 
Oh, I get it. 
A little pete time. 
Pardon the familiarity. 
Well, you just enjoy your coffee, sir, While I tell you a funny story About my friend's cat. 
His name is mr. Wiggles, 
And his cat's name is benson. 
Where's liz? 
I need to speak to her right away. 
I guess that's the end of pete and kenneth time. 
Liz, she's here. 
Verna's here. 
My mother is downstairs. 
Are you sure? 
I didn't see her. 
Security called. 
She was trying to use An oxycontin prescription bottle as I.D. 
That's verna. 
Oh! 
So is she coming up? 
Are you kidding? 
I told them to throw her off the property. 
But I'm sure she's down there, Sitting on a curb, chain-smoking, And waiting for me to come out. 
Just like the day I was born. 
Wow. 
Look, jenna, I know that she's no prize, But no matter what, verna is your mother. 
Don't you want to have a relationship with your mother? 
This isn't a relationship. 
This is some woman who shows up Every couple of years to ask for money. 
To her, I'm just a gorgeous, Naturally-blonde atm. 
You know, my mother and I sometimes didn't see eye to eye, But at the end of the day, we always said don't go to sleep with a frown in your pocket Ugh, liz, you don't know anything about mothers. 
Where's jack? 
go into your yard and tie it on a rocket Both: shoot it to the moon you'll be feeling better soon don't go to bed with a frown Yeah, there were firemen there and everything. 
Where? 
 At my house. 
I left my sith lord cloak Too near my mom's shrine to italian jesus, And the candles started a fire. 
Were the firemen strong? 
Were any of them the ones from the calendar? 
My mom's staying with family upstate, But I've got to find someplace around here to crash. 
I'm sorry. 
Would you like to stay in my guest house? 
Yeah. Thanks. 
When's good to go over there? 
Oh, I'm not offering. 
I'm just taking a survey To gauge general interest. 
But liz here has a spare apartment. 
Ain't that right, liz? 
Well, it's not really spare. 
I bought the place upstairs from me When I thought I was getting a talk show. 
But I'm gonna finish the combination As soon as I either hit the lottery Or get married. 
Ugh. Fine. You 
can stay with me. 
But it's stuff like this That makes me eat things like this. 
Thanks, liz. 
Oh, I'd like to pre-apologize For clogging your tub, sink, and toilet. 
Mothers. 
You can't kill them... 
Verna's been using me my whole life, jack. 
I never saw a penny from any of the commercials I booked. 
Keep you and your pets safe With gator hater gator spray. 
Sorry. Honey, you got to 
get closer to the gator. 
We drove eleven hours to get here, And you're not getting any younger. 
But when I wanted to sing a duet In a mother-daughter pageant, She blew it off because there was no prize money. 
But today's different, jenna. 
Today you break the cycle, Because today you are going to say... 
I developed this presentation in 2002 When colleen attempted To lengthen her christmas visit To martin luther king day, Or as she calls it, "that day in January When the post office is closed." 
I had to draw the line. 
I had to say... 
This word is your best friend. 
Best friend with benefits? 
Step one, say no. 
Step two... 
She will try to pick a fight with you. 
You will not let her. 
She will raise her voice. 
But I'm going to ask you to... 
Always speak quieter. 
Can I just tell you I'm genuinely having fun right now? 
If you raise your voice, Emotions take over, And she gets the upper hand. 
But if you're calm and quiet, You stay in control, And it's on to step three. 
And this is the hardest one of all. 
She will tell you how disappointed she is in you, And she will get up to leave, And you... 
Let her walk away. 
It's simple. 
Say no. Talk low. 
Let her go. 
Frank. Frank? 
Do you smell smoke? 
What the hell, frank? 
Oh, man. Look, liz 
How can you smoke? 
It's disgusting. 
And in my apartment? 
Wow. An old white 
lady yelling at me While wearing microwavable socks. 
This is so different than living with my mom. 
Okay, so I smoke a little as a stress release. 
I never told you, 'cause I knew you'd lecture me. 
It is not a lecture To simply point out to someone That the episode of diff'rent strokes About dudley's dad Has proven incontrovertibly That smoking destroys your health And leads to ridicule from willis. 
Well, what about you? 
You can't judge me When you're eating that garbage. 
This is not the same thing at all, frank. 
Dr. Oz did a show 
about junk food. 
I saw it, 'cause it's on a compilation dvd I have Of fat ladies crying. 
And this stuff will kill ya. 
"manufactured in a facility that also processes food." 
This is what meat cat spoke of. 
So I guess I'll just get One of those little throat radios, And you'll be buried in a piano crate. 
Goodnight, liz. 
No, frank, that fire in your apartment Was no accident. 
I know. I just wanted 
to be in control! 
It was fate! 
We've been brought together To help each other stop being gross. 
What do you say? 
All right. 
But if doing this restores my sex drive, The plus-sized ladies in the mail room Have you to blame. 
Oh, there's my baby girl! 
Hello, verna. 
No. Low. Go. 
Okay. I know. 
Every time we see each other, I'm always hitting you up for money. 
And I know that it's always for something stupid, Like paying the medical bills That time that my boyfriend Broke his tailbone off in that cage match. 
But this time it's different. 
I said no. 
Wait, what is this? 
I'm trying to pay you back. 
I'm trying to make good for once. 
Is this the fight? 
I'm talking quieter. 
I'm in control. 
What's that now? 
I'm the calm one. 
Upper hand. 
Jenna, why are we talking like this? 
Does somebody have a gun? 
I'm going lower now. 
Okay. 
Well, I know you're busy. 
I just wanted to say this face to face. 
I am so proud of you. 
And I love you so much. 
And I wish I'd said that more. 
Don't go, mommy. 
I'll stand closer to the gator. 
Goon! 
Sorry I'm late, mr. Hornberger. 
funny story. 
There was a guy on the subway Who I thought for a second didn't have any fingers. 
But then I realized He was holding his hand like this. 
Listen up, everyone. 
Frank and I have some exciting news to share. 
I am quitting smoking. 
And I am gonna start eating healthier. 
I signed up for a service called "noofud" That delivers humanely-portioned organic meals. 
And I took the elevator all the way up here Without losing my breath. 
Liz, god knows you should eat better, But maybe now's not the time. 
It's show week, And I can't have you melting down, And junk food is your stress release. 
We all need a release. 
I know, because kenneth has taken mine away from me, And I'm worried about what I'm gonna do to replace it. 
While you were talking, I put a thumbtack in my neck. 
Makes me feel something. 
Well, don't worry about me, pete. 
I have a new outlet My delicious noofud. 
Like my upcoming lunch, Autumn tempeh risotto With salmon-rubbed streusel chunks. 
Oh! 
Jenna? 
I just wanted to see How it went with verna last night. 
Jack, it was perfect. 
Like a john mayer song. 
Good. So you said no? 
I didn't have to. She 
didn't want anything. 
She's completely changed. 
What? No. 
People do not change. 
In the late '90s, I thought colleen had become a better person. 
It turns out she had a tumor Pressing on her brain's pleasure center. 
A tumor those quack doctors removed. 
Jack, this is different. 
She gave me money. 
It's not different, jenna. 
It never is. 
You must be verna. 
Oh, and you must be jack donaghy. 
Jenna, you were right, darlin'. 
He does look like he'd be great Between those two things we were talking about. 
Interesting earrings. 
Oh, thank you. I 
made 'em myself. 
Something's killing all the birds in my neighborhood. 
Mom, I really wish you didn't have to leave tonight. 
'cause my birthday's this weekend. 
Oh, my god. I am 
the worst mother. 
No. 
 Yes, I am. 
Don't say that. 
Could a bad mom have raised a daughter Who was engaged to a congressman when she was 16? 
Jenna to the stage, please. 
Oh, that's me. 
Oh, goodness. 
Oh. 
Blowing town tonight, huh? 
I knew it was her birthday. 
I'm throwing her a surprise party, And it's at a fancy restaurant, So wear something nice. 
Like a pair of white jeans And a dan marino jersey or something, 'kay? 
Hey. So how you holding up? 
Terrible. I have a 
headache, a stomachache. 
Last night I spent an hour Trying to remember how to spell the word "heighth." 
Liz, your body is crying out For all the chemicals it's used to. 
You can't go on like this. 
Here. Eat it. 
Eat it. Come on. 
You need your crutch. 
Stop it! 
God, your arms are really weak. 
What are you smiling at? 
Aren't youiserable? 
I have a very strong will. 
Rossitanos have refused to fight in seven wars. 
I don't buy it. 
There is no way that guy Is stronger than me. 
 Or me. 
He's got to be sneaking cigarettes. 
You're the one living with him. 
Catch him in the act. 
Yeah. I still have 
his old cigarette pack. 
I will leave it out tonight as a trap, And set up a video camera. 
Good idea. Nanny cam. 
Just like the one our nanny used To catch me watching her sleep. 
High five. 
Hi. I was told I'd get paid 
If I came here and danced while the atlanta hawks eat dinner. 
All: Surprise! 
Oh, my god! 
Mom, you remembered. 
Well, of course I remembered. 
Come here, sweetie. 
I've seen this before. 
Classic colleen move. 
Whatever it is verna wants, She's going to ask for it tonight, And jenna can't say no In front of all these people. 
My mother once won a radio contest To announce the starting lineups at a red sox game, And used the opportunity To get me to promise never to put her in a home. 
What could I do? 
Carl yastrzemski was looking right at me. 
This isn't about you, So you need to get over your issues And try to be happy for jenna. 
Speaking of issues, I had a dream the other night that we were married And I gave birth to a cartoon cat, so... 
Could I have Everybody's attention, please? 
Thank you. 
In my life, I've been a lot of things A liar. 
A dental hygienist. 
But I haven't always been A good mom. 
Jenna, honey, I don't know if you remember, But when you were 11, We were supposed to sing together At a mother-daughter talent pageant. 
I had completely forgotten about that. 
What betrayal? 
Well, I was drinking pretty heavily then... 
On account of my bad knee. 
And then I went and drove my jet ski Into that great big bunch of moss. 
So I did not make it to that pageant. 
Honey, I don't deserve a single thing from you, But I've got to ask one favor. 
And it's a big one. 
If you would do me the very great honor Of joining me? 
Hit it. 
do that to me one more time once is never enough with a daughter like you do that to me one more time I can never get enough of a mom like you oh Both: kiss me like you just did How are you not moved by this? 
Because I'm listening to the words. 
Both: do that to me once again Verna. 
Hey. 
Nice office, jack. 
I feel like I'm in The martha stewart section of kmart. 
What can I do for you? 
Oh, well, I just wanted to thank you For coming to the party. 
It meant a lot to jenna. 
And it was pretty important to me too. 
See, now you know what the show would be like. 
What show? 
Jack, I did not drive my home All the way to new york city Just to kiss my daughter's ass. 
Thank you. 
I want to do a tv show about me and her. 
You want to do a reality show? 
Come on. 
You see how good I am At pushing jenna's buttons. 
Yeah, this show will have laughter, tears, Topless arguments. 
Infections caused by jacuzzi water. 
I knew it. 
I knew you had something up your sleeve Besides a tattoo with, let me guess It's a mermaid. 
Doing it with captain morgan. 
Now, come on, jack. 
We both understand the value of a dollar. 
Oop. 
Now won't you please do me this favor? 
Talk to jenna. 
There's a lot more where that come from. 
Which is in my underpanties. 
come in. 
Jenna, I was right. 
I was right all along. 
What's that? 
Oh. New earrings. 
My mom just made them. 
So they still might have some pigeon mites. 
But she said those can't affect-affect humans-humans. 
Yes, well, it certainly is amazing To see how your mother has made this 180. 
It's even better, jack. 
She's made a full 360. 
Well, I just wanted to come by And make sure you're okay. 
I'm glad to see you're so happy. 
I am happy. 
Because now I have everything. 
Good morning, dummies. 
So frank can go cold turkey but I can't? 
Well, well, well. 
Frank's old cigarettes. 
When I went to bed last night, There were 15 cigarettes in the pack. 
This morning, there were 12. 
What? 
 J'accuse! 
Look, I don't know where those cigarettes went. 
If only some genius Had secretly videotaped her living room last night. 
Oh, wait. It did. 
Hang on. You videotaped 
your living room? 
All night? 
Sure did. 
And as soon as I figure out Which one of these things Is the thingy... 
Coming at you. 
Gimme. 
You didn't believe in me. 
But I believed in myself. 
Just like the last scene Of all movies. 
Okay. Here we go. 
What are you wearing? 
Both: They're called night spanx. 
I don't even remember getting up. 
What am I doing? 
You're sleepwalking, liz. 
It's a little-understood parasomnial disorder. 
That's gross. 
She's not sleep walking. 
Oh, my god. I'm sleep eating. 
You tried to take away your release, liz, But nature finds a way. 
Did you learn nothing from jurassic park? 
Why am I making a phone call? 
Okay, I don't mean to be the black guy at the movie, But you better move, girl! 
Uh-oh. 
Oh, liz, you didn't! 
I ordered a pizza? 
Oh! 
Oh, I don't want to see this. 
Okay, fine. 
I cheated in my sleep. 
But frank folded too, Because I am not making it up about the cigarettes. 
Any minute he's gonna  wait, what are you doing now? 
No. No. Please, no. 
Oh, god, liz. You 
didn't smoke the I'm eating it. 
Okay, well, mystery solved. 
Liz ate the cigarettes, And I guess some of us Just don't need a release. 
So let's turn the tv off. 
Hang on. 
Oh, thanks, frank. 
Oh, there's more. 
Denise, I said wait upstairs. 
My boss is asleep in the other room. 
I was told You have a package for the mail room. 
Oh, come on! 
This just got awesome. 
I need you, denise. 
I'm trying to quit smoking, And my mom's not here. 
I'm your mama now, baby. 
don't go to sleep with a frown in your pocket go into your yard and tie it on a rocket This is the worst thing I've ever seen. 
you'll be feeling better soon Both: don't go to bed with a frown I love you, denise mommy. 
We all need our release. 
Verna, I want to be in business with you. 
Oh! Ho, ho, ho! 
We are gonna be swimming in green, jack. 
Just like when I dye my pool on st. Patrick's day. 
I do have a couple of notes. 
This project will not be about Drama or dysfunction. 
People are tired of that. 
Well, so what's it about? 
Redemption. 
It's about a mother making amends to her daughter. 
And it's not a show. 
It's four visits per year Christmas, mother's day, Jenna's birthday, and thanksgiving. 
You treat jenna with the respect she deserves, You get a check. 
You're trying to bribe me Into being a good mom. 
Well, it is all just about money, Isn't it, verna? 
Well, maybe for me. 
But this is emotional for you, isn't it? 
And I believe that gives me the upper hand, And you're gonna have to pay. 
Big. 
3 grand a visit, And a rain tarp for my washer and dryer. 
Deal. 
Verna, stop stroking my palm With your middle finger. 
This is a businessransaction. 
Sorry. 
Whoo-hoo, mr. Big stuff. 
Dudley's father went outside And lit a cigarette. 
In the next episode Good morning, pete, kenneth. 
 Liz. 
If you are spending your mornings with kenneth, What's your release? 
Uh... 
Oh, I feel alive! 
I've been biting my nails. 
Oh. 
Hey, liz. 
Verna's coming back for mother's day. 
We're gonna do a duet of I'll make love to you At a children's hospital. 
That's great, jenna. 
Hey, jack, guess what? 
Verna's coming back for mother's day. 
She is? What a surprise. 
So I guess you were 100% wrong about everything. 
Think about that, jack. 
You're a good man, jack donaghy. 
Thanks, meat cat. 
I've got an idea for a show called Doctor. 
About Richard Doctor, who's a piano player. 
Remember that show Jennifer slliped here. 
Anne Jillian plays a ghost of a hollywood starlet who helps teenagers. 
With what? I don't know! 
Some of those people on Magic Cane were drunk... with power. 
Did you know that Today Show used to have a monkey on it. 
Hasn't been this good since. 
I think that chimp used to drive a truck himself. 
On you-know-what and the bear. 
 SO WE'RE AGREED. 
ASSUMING NOTHING GOES WRONG IN THE NEXT EIGHT HOURS, JAYDEN MICHAEL TYLER WILL BE THE NEXT TGS CAST MEMBER. 
 EIGHT CITIES, 40 COMICS, ONE SLAP FIGHT WITH A TSA AGENT. 
I'M DONE. 
JAYDEN'S THE ONE. 
NOW WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE JACK THINK THAT HIRING JAYDEN WAS HIS DECISION. 
WHO ARE THE DECOYS WE WILL BE USING FOR THE AUDITION? 
 UH, MIDDLEAGED FEMALE COMIC WITH A BOLO TIE, ONE-MAN BAND WHO ONLY PLAYS HALLOWEEN MUSIC, AND AUSTRALIA'S JACKIE MASON. 
JACK WILL HATE ALL OF THEM AND PICK JAYDEN. 
 UGH, I HATE DOING THIS TO PEOPLE. 
THEY ALL THINK THIS IS THEIR BIG BREAK, BUT WE'RE JUST USING THEM. 
 CALL IT THE HORNBERGER SYSTEM. 
 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS, PETE. 
AUDITIONING IS HARD. 
SO MUCH REJECTION. 
ELIZABETH LEMON, I AM REPRESENTED BY SUZANNE'S B-PLUS TALENT. 
MY CARPETS NEED A DEEP CLEAN. 
 NEXT! 
 AND THEN YOU CALL YOUR MOM AND TELL HER, "IT WENT GREAT," AND YOU'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS YEAR. 
 I KNOW IT'S NO FUN, BUT YOU ARE MAKING THIS GUY'S DREAMS COME TRUE. 
AT YOUR AGE, IT'S PROBABLY THE LAST TIME YOU'LL EVER MAKE A MAN HAPPY. 
  THAT'S TRUE, LIZ IS OLD. 
UH, WHERE ARE WE ON THIS AUDITION? 
 UH, WE'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO FOUR PEOPLE FOR THIS AFTERNOON. 
 I'M ALREADY NOT LIKING SOME OF THESE PEOPLE. 
IT REMINDS ME OF BEING ON THE BUS. 
 COME ON, GUYS, THESE ARE PEOPLE UP HERE WITH FEELINGS AND MOTHERS WHO WORRY ABOUT THEM. 
 LEMON, STOP RIGHT THERE. 
YOU ARE ON TOP OF THE PYRAMID. 
TGS IS A SMALL PYRAMID, WHICH NEVERTHELESS WILL ONE DAY BE YOUR TOMB. 
YOU CAN'T LET EMOTIONS DISTRACT YOU FROM MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THE SLAVES WHO BUILT THE PYRAMID, WHICH, AGAIN, WILL ONE DAY BE YOUR TOMB. 
 GEEZ. 
SORRY I'M NOT A ROBOT. 
 WE ALL ARE. 
BUT WE'RE GETTING THERE. 
IN TEN YEARS, THIS'LL ALL BE THE SIZE OF A MICROCHIP. 
BUT UNTIL THEN, YOU'RE IN CHARGE. 
THINK LIKE A ROBOT. 
BE LOGICAL AND DISPASSIONATE. 
 ARE YOU OKAY? 
 SEE, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT--HUMAN EMPATHY. 
IT'S AS USELESS AS THE WINTER OLYMPICS. 
THIS FEBRUARY ON NBC. 
 TRACY. 
I JUST HEARD THEY'RE CLOSING DOWN THE SET TODAY. 
DO YOU THINK IT'S FOR AUDITIONS? 
 JENNIFER M, WHY ARE YOU SO WORKED UP? 
 BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE A DISASTER. 
LIKE KATRINA. 
DO YOU REMEMBER KATRINA? 
THAT CRAZY GIRL FROM HAIR AND MAKE-UP? 
 NOTHING'S GONNA CHANGE. 
THEY'RE GONNA HIRE SOME SKINNY WHITE GUY. 
HOW IS THAT A THREAT? 
YOU'LL DO YOUR LADY CHARACTERS, AND I WILL GET ONSTAGE AND PEOPLE WILL LAUGH EVEN WHEN I FORGET MY, UM, MY--LINE. 
 LINES. 
 LINES. 
 EVERYBODY'S A THREAT, TRACY. 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S GONNA WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR. 
 IT'S TRUE. 
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE AUDITION PROCESS. 
 OH, YEAH, I FORGOT, DOTCOM. 
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ACTING BECAUSE YOU PLAYED A BIRD IN SOME STUPID SCHOOL PLAY. 
 YES, TRACY. 
I WAS TRIGORIN IN THE SEAGULL ON THE WESLEYAN ARTSPACE MAINSTAGE. 
 HE WILL KNOW. 
 VAMPYR! 
 ARE THEY CLOSING THE STAGE THIS AFTERNOON FOR AUDITIONS? 
WHAT'S ON THAT PIECE OF PAPER? 
 UH, MISS LEMON DID SAY, "KEEP THIS AWAY FROM JENNA." 
BUT SHE MAY HAVE MEANT THE JENNA THAT WORKS DOWNSTAIRS AT THAT LUGGAGE STORE... 
SO I'M GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU. 
 THANK YOU, KENNETH. 
 OH, MY, SIR. 
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT A BAD CASE OF THE CHEWDADDIES. 
OZARK KISSES? 
THE WOODSMAN'S COMPANION? 
BEDBUGS. THEY'RE A BIG PROBLEM 
IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW. 
 I DON'T HAVE BEDBUGS, KENNETH, I WENT TO PRINCETON. 
 SIR, ANYONE CAN GET THEM. 
BACK IN STONE MOUNTAIN, EVEN THE MAYOR HAD BEDBUGS. 
AND SHE WAS A HORSE. 
 I'M SORRY. 
AM I INTERRUPTING? 
 UHUH, NO, BRECKMAN, IT'S NOTHING. 
 IT'S NOT NOTHING, SIR. 
MR. DONAGHY'S GOT 
BLUE RIDGE QUILT TICKLERS. 
OH, SORRY. BEDBUGS. 
 BEDBUGS? 
CAN'T THOSE LIVE IN YOUR CLOTHES? 
 THAT'S TRUE, MR. DONAGHY. 
THE MAYOR HAD TO BURN ALL HER PANTSUITS. 
 DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, BRECKMAN. 
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE, UH, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT MEETING AT 11:00. 
 YOU KNOW WHAT, UH, WE MAY NOT NEED YOU FOR THAT. 
SO I'M GONNA GO NOW. 
 HEY, WHAT'S UP, DOTCOM? 
 THE GREAT UTA HAGEN ONCE SAID... 
"IS WHY I'D LIKE TO AUDITION FOR TGS." 
WALTER, YOU IDIOT. 
YOU LOST A CARD. 
 WAIT, YOU WANNA AUDITION? 
 OH, DOTCOM, I THINK YOU'RE GREAT. 
BUT NO, I'M SORRY, YOU CAN'T. 
 I THANK YOU FOR TREATING MY REQUESTS WITH RESPECT. 
 LIZ, I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU. 
 BEAT IT, GRIZZ OR DOTCOM. 
I SAW YOUR AUDITION LIST. 
 WHAT? 
NOW, I TOLD KENNETH TO LUGGAGE STORE JENNA. 
 WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS BESIDES JAYDEN MICHAEL TYLER? 
 A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE. 
 YOU'RE SETTING HIM UP TO GET IT. 
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW THAT TRICK? 
YOU DON'T THINK I'VE BEEN BROUGHT IN ON A MILLION AUDITIONS JUST TO MAKE KIM CATTRALL SEEM GROUNDED AND HUMAN? 
 YES, FINE, WE'RE STACKING THE DECK FOR JAYDEN. 
LET ME GUESS WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS WITH HIM. 
HE'S A TALENTED ACTOR AND YOU'RE THREATENED BY THAT. 
 NO, I KNOW HIM, LIZ. 
WE DID A PLAY TOGETHER 20 YEARS AGO, AND WE WERE BEST FRIENDS. 
UNTIL HE BETRAYED ME. 
 HEY, JENNA, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NOMINATION. 
FOR WORST SUPPORTING BRA! 
 WHAT PLAY IS THAT? 
 I WILL NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. 
 UGH. 
THIS PROCESS IS PAINFUL ENOUGH WITHOUT ADDING YOUR CRAZY TO IT. 
 TOO LATE. 
I'M GETTING THAT HOT FEELING IN MY HEAD. 
   HEY, MOM, IT'S WALTER. 
I'M JUST CALLING TO TELL YOU THEY CANCELLED THE AUDITION, SO MAYBE PRAY ON SOMETHING ELSE. 
 YOU CAN AUDITION. 
 I'LL NEED A PIANO. 
   WHAT IS THIS? 
 IT'S CISCO EQUIPMENT, SIR. 
IT'S ALMOST BETTER THAN BEING THERE. 
 IS THIS BECAUSE OF MY BEDBUGS? 
I WILL NOT BE OSTRACIZED LIKE THIS. 
 JACK, BEDBUGS HAVE BECOME AN EPIDEMIC IN NEW YORK. 
I JUST THINK THAT EVERYONE WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IF YOU STAYED IN YOUR OFFICE. 
YOU LIKE THE CISCO EQUIPMENT? 
 OF COURSE, IT CONTINUES TO BE THE GOLD STANDARD BY WHICH ALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY IS JUDGED. 
CISCO, THE HUMAN NETWORK. 
 THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LIVE NORTH OF 62ND STREET. 
 YOU THINK I DIDN'T HEAR THAT? 
I CAN HEAR YOUR HAIR GROWING ON THIS THING. 
YOU ARE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ME. 
I AM A HUMAN BEING. 
DID YOU JUST MUTE ME? 
DID YOU JUST USE CISCO'S CUTTING EDGE SUREMUTE TECHNOLOGY TO MUTE ME? 
 BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A UNITED FRONT. 
BART SAID THAT IF WE GO IN THERE WITH THE NUMBERS ALL SET  I'M GONNA COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND CRAWL INTO YOUR BED AND I'M GONNA BITE YOU ON THE ASS, DO YOU HEAR ME? 
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DOTCOM'S AUDITIONING? 
HOW DUMB ARE YOU? 
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THERE? 
 PETE, STOP IT. 
YOU KNOW MY FONTANELLE NEVER CLOSED. 
I TRIED TO BE STRONG, BUT I JUST COULDN'T TELL HIM NO. 
AND NOW I DON'T HAVE TO, SEE, BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING IT JACK'S DECISION. 
 OH, WE WERE, BUT NOW YOU'VE COMPROMISED THE HORNBERGER SYSTEM. 
IT'S FOUR PEOPLE FOR A REASON. 
THE FIRST GUY JACK'S SETTLING IN, THE SECOND HE HATES, THE THIRD IS JAYDEN, THE FOURTH PROVES HOW GOOD JAYDEN IS. 
THE MORE PEOPLE YOU ADD, THE LESS EFFECTIVE IT IS. 
LIKE A NEIGHBORHOOD DAD GARAGE BAND. 
 COME ON, IT'S JUST DOTCOM. 
 IT WON'T BE, BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING. 
 I'M DRIVING A BUS? 
 NO, YOU'RE YOU'RE OPENING THE FLOODGATES. 
 WITH A HORIZONTAL WHEEL? 
 FLOODGATE WHEELS ARE HORIZONTAL! 
IT WAS ALL UNDER CONTROL. 
NOW EVERYONE'S GONNA WANT IN AND WE CAN'T STOP THEM. 
 HEY, WHAT THE FRAK, NERDS? 
PETE TOLD ME YOU WERE ONLY LOOKING AT OUTSIDE PEOPLE. 
NOW DOTCOM'S AUDITIONING? 
 FRANK, I KNOW YOU'RE A STANDUP, BUT  NO "BUT." 
I WANT IN. 
AND I'M NOT CHANGING MY ACT TO FIT YOUR STUPID SHOW. 
 MMHMM. 
 LIZ, THERE YOU ARE. 
 I HEARD ABOUT THIS WHOLE DOTCOM THING. 
I'M NOT SAYING I WANT TO AUDITION, BUT NICKY MOTORULO FROM SCOTCH PLAINS, NEW JERSEY MIGHT BE INTERESTED. 
'EY, FUHGEDDABOUTIT. 
 ACTOR EMERGENCY! 
 WHERE? 
 HERE. 
PETE AND LIZ WANNA HIRE THIS GUY JAYDEN. 
HE'S EVIL, TRACY. 
 HE'S EVIL TRACY? 
OH, HE'S EVIL "COMMA" TRACY. 
GO ON. 
 PETE AND LIZ ARE RIGGING IT TO MAKE SURE HE GETS THE JOB. 
DO YOU KNOW WHO ELSE THEY'RE AUDITIONING? 
A ONE-MAN BAND. 
SOME OLD AUSTRALIAN, DOTCOM. 
 DOTCOM? 
OH, NO. 
I ONCE SAW THAT GUY BECOME TRIGORIN AT THE WESLEYAN ARTSPACE. 
THAT GUY IS GOOD. 
I CAN'T COMPETE WITH HIM. 
 OKAY. 
THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE NEITHER ONE OF THEM GETS THE JOB BY FINDING BETTER ACTORS OURSELVES. 
 GOOD IDEA. LET'S GO. 
 CALL MY CAR, I NEED TO GO TO THE DERMATOLOGIST. 
 I'M SORRY, SIR. 
BUT UNTIL YOU GET THIS BEDBUG SITUATION FIXED, THEY DON'T WANT YOU USING YOUR COMPANY CAR. 
IN FACT, THEY SUGGESTED YOU TAKE... 
A TAXICAB! 
 HEY. 
WHY ARE YOU SCRATCHING? 
YOU HAVE MUGABE'S CONCUBINES. 
NO, BEDBUGS! 
 GOOD AFTERNOON, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M SORRY YOU BOTHER YOU, MY NAME IS JACK. 
AND I HAVE BEDBUGS. 
I'M NOT A DRUG ADDICT. 
I AM AN EXECUTIVE WITH THE GENERAL ELECTRIC CORPORATION AND I JUST NEED TO GET MY MEDICINE. 
IF SOMEONE COULD TELL ME HOW TO TRANSFER TO THE 4 TRAIN, I WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR HELP. 
GOD BLESS YOU, AND HAVE A GOOD DAY. 
instruments tuning]  HAPPY? 
 NO, NOT SINCE I WAS A CHILD. 
WHAT IS KATHY GEISS DOING HERE? 
 HER FATHER HEARD ABOUT BRIAN WILLIAMS AND INSISTED SHE GET A CHANCE. 
THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE HERE FOR THE HORNBERGER SYSTEM, LIZ. 
WHAT IF JACK ACTUALLY PICKS ONE OF THESE WEIRDOS? 
DO YOU KNOW THE AUSTRALIAN JACKIE MASON WAS CHEMICALLY CASTRATED BY HIS GOVERNMENT? 
   LIZ. PETE. 
 JAYDEN. YOU MADE IT. 
 SO THIS IS MY COMPETITION, HUH? 
   NO! BAD! 
SORRY. 
IT'S A LITTLE CRAZY HERE TODAY. 
 ARE YOU KIDDING? 
I'M JUST HAPPY TO BE HERE. 
THIS IS CORNY, BUT WILL YOU TAKE A PICTURE OF ME IN FRONT OF THE TGS SIGN? 
 YES, OF COURSE. 
 THANKS. 
MAYBE THIS WILL CONVINCE MY MOM TO STOP SENDING ME LAW SCHOOL APPLICATIONS. 
 MY MOM USED TO SEND ME ARTICLES ABOUT HOW OLDER VIRGINS ARE CONSIDERED GOOD LUCK IN MEXICO. 
 OKAY, WELL, I'LL SEE YOU ONSTAGE. 
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING. 
 OKAY, THIS MAY BE A TRAIN WRECK, BUT THAT IS THE BODY THAT WE NEED TO PULL OUT OF IT. 
 ALL RIGHT. 
I'LL RETHINK THE SYSTEM AND TRY TO MAKE IT WORK. 
 HEY, AT LEAST WE KNOW IT CAN'T GET ANY WORSE. 
 IF YOU ARE A FUNNY GAY MAN, PLEASE GET INTO THE CAR. 
 I REPEAT, ALL FUNNY GAYS INTO THE CAR. 
 I'M NOT GAY. 
I'M BI-LARIOUS!  
 BLACK PEOPLE, I KNOW I'VE SAID SOME TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT YOU IN PRINT. 
BUT I COME HERE TODAY ON A MISSION OF PEACE. 
 WE NEED THE FUNNIEST FOOL HERE TO STEP FORWARD. 
 KOLANDRA! KOLANDRA! 
KOLANDRA! KOLANDRA! 
KOLANDRA! KOLANDRA! 
 THAT'LL WORK. 
 GOOD LUCK ON YOUR AUDITION. 
YOU'RE GONNA GET IT. 
 DON'T JINX ME. 
 WALTER, YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT. 
I MADE YOU SOMETHING. 
 IT'S A SEAGULL. 
 OH, MR. DONAGHY. 
DID THEY MAKE YOU RIDE THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR? 
 I WALKED IN YOUR SHOES TODAY, KENNETH. 
 I DON'T THINK YOU DID, SIR. 
I'VE JUST GOT THE ONE PAIR, AND I SLEEP IN THEM. 
 I FELL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PYRAMID TODAY. 
CAST OUT OF SOCIETY LIKE A LEPER. 
NO ONE WILL LOOK AT ME, LET ALONE TOUCH ME. 
BUT YOU WILL, WON'T YOU? 
MAKE ME FEEL HUMAN AGAIN. 
EMBRACE ME, KENNETH. 
 I'VE GOT A THING. 
 ET TU, KENNETH? 
 IT'S JUST A MATH EQUATION, THAT'S ALL. 
JUST, OKAY--YOU PUT TWO WOMEN IN A ROW LIKE WHO THE HELL ARE THEY? 
 THESE ARE SOME ACTORS WE FOUND DRIVING ALL OVER THIS AMAZING VIBRANT CITY. 
 AND THIS IS A REIMBURSEMENT FORM FOR MY GAS. 
I DROVE A MILLION MILES. 
 LOOK. 
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DRAGGED THIS IDIOT IN ON YOUR PARANOIA  PARANOIA? WHERE? 
 UGH! 
YOU ARE NOT TAKING AWAY THE ONE GOOD THING THAT I GET OUT OF THIS MISERABLE PROCESS. 
 IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HIRING JAYDEN, YOU'RE INSANE. 
JUST CALL ANYONE HE'S EVER WORKED WITH. 
 I DID. 
I CALLED EVERY ONE OF HIS REFERENCES, AND THEY ARE IMPRESSIVE. 
A COMMERCIAL WITH MARTIN SCORSESE, AN OFF-BROADWAY PLAY WITH CHRISTOPHER WALKEN. 
HE'S EVEN STUDYING THE MEISNER TECHNIQUE WITH SIR GILBERT GOTTFRIED. 
AND THEY ALL SAID THE SAME THING. 
Scorsese: ALL RIGHT, LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING ABOUT JAYDEN. 
I LOVE JAYDEN. 
Walken: I LOVE JAYDEN. 
Gottfried: I LOVE JAYDEN! 
 WAS DESCRIBING YOUR SANDWICH NECESSARY TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED? 
 NONE OF YOUR ACTORS ARE AUDITIONING. 
THE HORNBERGER SYSTEM WILL PREVAIL. 
 THINK AGAIN, LIZ. 
THE HORNBERGER SYSTEM WILL DE-VAIL. 
IS THAT THE OPPOSITE OF PREVAIL? 
   I HOPED IT WOULDN'T COME TO THIS. 
BUT NOW I HAVE TO RUIN JAYDEN PSYCHOLOGICALLY. 
 TELL ME MORE. 
 I'M GONNA WALK UP TO HIM AND SAY THE FOUR MOST VICIOUS WORDS YOU CAN SAY TO A PERSON YOU'VE ALREADY MET. 
"NICE TO MEET YOU." 
 AND THAT FREAKS PEOPLE OUT, HUH? 
THIS IS A LEARNING AND FRIENDSHIP ADVENTURE. 
 LEMON, ARE YOU READY TO GET STARTED? 
 YES, I JUST NEED ONE MINUTE TO SEND SOME OF THESE PEOPLE HOME. 
 REALLY? 
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO KICK ALL OF THEM TO THE CURB LIKE SO MUCH HUMAN GARBAGE? 
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO COLD AND DISPASSIONATE? 
 WHAT? 
BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME TO. 
 AND YOU JUST BLINDLY DO WHATEVER I SAY? 
WHAT ARE YOU, A ROBOT? 
 YOU ALSO TOLD ME TO BE A ROBOT. 
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU? 
 I HAVE BEDBUGS. 
AND THESE BEDBUGS HAVE CHEWED THE BLINDERS OFF MY EYES. 
THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE, LEMON. 
WITH FEELINGS. 
 GRR! 
 AND THEY ALL GET A CHANCE. 
THEY ALL GET TO AUDITION. 
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO AUDITION, JUST GIVE YOUR NAME TO PETE. 
 ANTHONY DECICCO. 
I'LL NEED AN OBAMA WIG. 
FRANK ROSSITANO. 
QUEENS, NEW YORK. 
I GUESS DREAMS CAN COME TRUE. 
SO LAST WEEKEND, I WAS AT THE MALL, BUT THEN I WENT TO THE BEACH  WITH MY NIECE'S FRIEND AND THEN I  AT THE POOL PARTY. 
 MMHMM. 
MM. 
 FOR MY FIRST CHARACTER, I'D LIKE TO DO AN OLD JANITOR WHO'S FINALLY HAD ENOUGH AND STABS EVERYBODY! 
 HELLO, I'M JENNA MARONEY. 
 OH, HI, I'M JAYDEN, NICE TO MEET YOU. 
 HOW DARE YOU PRETEND YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME! 
I'M THE ONE WHO DOESN'T REMEMBER YOU! 
 JOSH GERARD. 
FORMER TGS CAST MEMBER. 
THEN SOME MOVIE WORK. 
THAT DIDN'T PAN OUT. 
THEN MY AGENT DROPPED ME. 
THEN A WEB SHORT. 
WHERE THEY MADE ME DO GUY-GUY STUFF. 
OH, GOD, FORGIVE ME! 
I CALL THIS CHARACTER SMELLY BELLY. 
 GOOD EVENING, WE ARE LAUGH OF THE MOHICANS. 
OUR FIRST BIT IS THE HAMBURGLAR  NO! 
 TOOFER AND LUTZ DIDN'T TELL ME THEY WERE GONNA GO TOGETHER. 
THIS THROWS OFF THE WHOLE SYSTEM. 
I GOTTA FIND ONE MORE. 
 HEY, DOTCOM. 
NICE TO MEET YOU. 
 WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT TO ME? 
 HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REFRIGERATOR AFTER THE LIGHT GOES OFF? 
DOES THE MILK SAY, "LET'S GO DOWN TO THE CRISPER DRAWER AND MAKE TROUBLE"? 
I DON'T KNOW. 
FUHGEDDABOUTIT. 
 YOU WANNA BE ON A TV SHOW? 
COME ON. 
COME ON, COME ON. 
 GROWING UP IN BEDSTUY, THERE WAS A CERTAIN MUSIC TO THE WAY PEOPLE TALKED. 
"HEY, PAPI WHATCHOO DOIN'?" 
I'M SORRY, CAN I START OVER? 
SOMEONE REALLY MESSED WITH MY HEAD RIGHT BEFORE I CAME ON. 
 I DREAMED THAT LOVE  WOULD NEVER DIE  I DREAMED THAT GOD  WOULD BE FORGIVING     OKAY. HERE WE GO. 
YOU CAN DO IT. 
 HI, I'M JAYDEN MICHAEL TYLER. 
MY FIRST PIECE WILL BE A DINNER PARTY AT MARTIN SCORSESE'S HOUSE WITH CHRISTOPHER WALKEN AND GILBERT GOTTFRIED. 
 WHAT? 
  THANK YOU FOR INVITING US, MARTIN. 
  I BROUGHT WINE! 
   SON OF A BITCH. 
I WAS TALKING TO YOU ON THE PHONE, WASN'T I? 
 WHAT? 
  GIVE...IT UP. 
I FIGURED OUT... 
YOUR GAME. 
 CONGRATULATIONS. 
YOUR SHOW IS SO STUPID, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE TOO. 
 I CAN'T BELIEVE I WENT THROUGH ALL OF THIS FOR YOU. 
I FOUGHT FOR YOU, JAYDEN, AND NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO START ALL OVER. 
 NO, YOU DON'T. 
YOU'RE GIVING ME THE JOB NO MATTER WHAT. 
BECAUSE YOUR FINGERPRINTS ARE ALL OVER MY CAMERA. 
 SO? 
 SO? 
YOU SAID YOU'D ONLY HIRE ME IF I LET YOU TAKE PICTURES OF MY GENITALS. 
 OH, NO! 
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THEM? 
JENNA WAS RIGHT. 
YOU'RE TOTALLY CRAZY. 
 WOULD A CRAZY PERSON LAUGH LIKE THIS? 
   YOU CAN USE THE REGULAR ELEVATORS AROUND THE CORNER. 
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S HUMAN HERE. 
   WELL SAID. 
 JENNA, YOU'RE RIGHT. 
HE'S CRAZY. 
WE CAN'T HIRE HIM. 
 WHO, BRIAN WILLIAMS? 
 NO, JAYDEN. 
I'M SORRY I DOUBTED YOU. 
IT'S JUST THAT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN RIGHT BEFORE. 
ABOUT ANYTHING. 
 I KNOW. 
 I GOTTA FIND JACK. 
TELL HIM WE DIDN'T FIND ANYONE AND WE HAVE TO START OVER. 
 MY TWO CENTS? 
I LIKED THE JANITOR. 
 I'D NEVER BEEN TO AN AUDITION BEFORE. 
IT WAS UPSETTING. 
A GROTESQUE CARNIVAL OF HUMAN MISERY. 
 TO BE FAIR, I DID NOT THINK KATHY GEISS WAS GONNA FINISH HER SONG BY TAKING OFF HER UNDERPANTS. 
 HOWEVER, THE PROCESS WAS A PLEASANT REMINDER THAT SOME OF US ARE, IN FACT, BETTER THAN OTHERS. 
THERE WAS ONE CLEAR STANDOUT IN MY OPINION. 
 NO, I KNOW. 
HE WAS MY FAVORITE TOO, BUT WE CAN'T. 
HE'S CRAZY. 
WE HAVE TO START OVER. 
 ALL ACTORS ARE CRAZY, LEMON, AND THE MORE TALENTED THEY ARE, THE CRAZIER THEY ARE. 
I MEAN, LOOK AT JENNA AND TRACY. 
THEY HANDED IN A CHECK REQUEST FORM FOR $600,000 WORTH OF GAS. 
YOUR JOB IS TO MANAGE THE CRAZY AND BRING OUT THE TALENT. 
 CRAZY IS ONE THING, HE'S A PSYCHOPATH. 
 YOU'RE WRONG. 
HE'S A GOOD PERSON. 
AND THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER. 
WE'RE HIRING THE ROBOT. 
 THE ROBOT... 
IS THE GUY THAT YOU LIKE. 
AND YOU THINK HE'S THE BEST... 
BECAUSE? 
 BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THEM, THE ONLY PERSON IN NEW YORK THAT WOULD SHAKE THE HAND OF A MAN WITH BEDBUGS. 
LEMON, WE'RE NOT JUST HIRING AN ACTOR. 
WE'RE HIRING A COWORKER, A HUMAN BEING, AND I SAY WE HIRE THE ONE WHO LIVES BY THE CODE OF THE ROBOT. 
CARE. LOVE. LIVE. 
 OKAY. 
SO INSTEAD OF STARTING FROM SCRATCH, WE ARE HIRING THE ROBOT. 
ON THE SHOW. 
TO ACT. 
BOY, I HOPE HE SPEAKS ENGLISH. 
YIKES. 
I wrote that! I'm Liz Lemon. 
"If your man is over 30, and still wears a name tag to work, that's a deal-breaker." 
But not you, Mike. 
That's not you. 
Mike, leave my cutout alone. 
Okay, you know, I'm gonna do the same thing to your cutout. 
Oh, wait, you don't have one, because you're nobody. 
Blam-O! Another successful 
interaction with a man! 
30 Rock - Season 4 Episode 02. 
Edited by He7LOW0RlD Yes, Mr. Geiss, of course. 
Well, I'll only be in D.C. for 
the day, but if I find time, I'll be sure to go see Fonzie's jacket. 
You sit on it as well. 
Hey, if you're going to D.C., I lost my 
retainer there during a junior High field trip. 
What can I do for you, Lemon? 
Well, I wanted to give you a copy of my book. 
They used your blurb. 
"Lemon numbers among my employees. 
"Sir, your bus to Washington leaves in half an hour. 
You're taking a bus? 
I have to. 
Ever since these buffoons from Detroit took private planes, the rest of us have to put on a show. 
And now, your president-who, by the way, is Kenyan and smokes cigarettes, has created an industry task force for microwaves and small appliances. 
Why? Do you need to be bailed 
out with my tax dollars? 
Even if they wanted to, I wanted take it. 
It's corporate welfare, Lemon. 
Granted, the microwave industry isn't what it used to be, and the American love affair with the microwave oven has cooled since its postwar heyday. 
* and she told her daddy she was doin' the microwave ?* 
* do the microwave?* 
Did that happen? 
But, unlike Detroit, we don't need handouts or regulation. 
I'm gonna go down there, talk circles around these hacks, and catch the afternoon bus back to Chinatown. 
Now, where was the last place you remember having your retainer? 
I took it out to eat astronaut ice cream at the air and space museum. 
Air and space... 
If your man collects action figures, that's a deal-breaker? 
What? Oh, yeah. 
Last weekend, I picked up this girl after practicing Jedi moves in prospect park. 
Also a deal-breaker. 
I took her back to my house on the handlebars of my bike. 
As is that. 
Snuck her inside, past my mom. 
Wow, that's four. She sees my mint-condition 
Hellboy figurine and starts quoting your dumb book! 
Also, my girlfriend is mad. 
In Canada. 
Ms. Lemon, would it be all right 
if I only worked 20 hours today? 
I'm volunteering at an animal shelter later on. 
Oh, of course. I didn't 
know you did volunteer work. 
Oh, yes. I also help out at the pants 
for zoo animals program and big brother. 
Really? I did big sister in college. That 
little girl taught me how to use tampons. 
Oh, no, this big brother isn't affiliated with the mentoring program. 
It's an organization that secretly watches people and makes sure they're behaving properly. 
Liz, I don't if you saw the crawl on the TV guide channel, but I've agreed to star in a sexy, supernatural thriller in the vein of twilight and true blood. 
Oh, that's good. The vampire 
movies are hot right now. 
This is actually a werewolf picture that, for tax reasons, is shooting in Iceland. 
I play a moon scientist who's trying to get to the bottom of things, and who-spoiler alert-may herself be a werewolf. 
We start shooting tonight. 
You can't leave. You 
have rehearsal tomorrow. 
Oh, well, why don't you get the New cast member to cover for me? 
Okay. 
Look, I know that you're mad about Jack's decision to bring in another actor, and you want to punish me. 
Punish you? Please, Liz. 
I've just always wanted to shoot a student werewolf movie in Iceland, where I'm filling in last-minute for Victoria Beckham. 
Or we could sit down and talk about this like adults. 
Liz Lemon! You booger face! I'm 
gonna kill you with a bazooka! 
I bought my wife that dumb book of yours, and the more Angie reads it, the madder she gets at me. 
Well, maybe that's on you, tray. 
No, it's off me! 
A book hasn't caused me this much trouble since where's Waldo went to that barber pole factory. 
It's on you Liz Lemon. 
And you will be punished. 
This'll take ten minutes. 
Let's hit the meadowlands racetrack on the way home. 
I've got a betting system based on horse penis size. 
Is it true, Mr. Donaghy, that your executives routinely 
used company helicopters to dry their home tennis courts? 
Yes, and no. yes, that did 
happen. No, it didn't not happen. 
And that G.E. kept a party clown on 
retainer with a six-figure salary? 
When silly Willy's fee was amortized over all birthdays company wide I'm being told that company money is being gambled at racetracks. 
Yes, but I have a system. 
In 2007, a G.E. officer used corporate funds to throw 
a cabaret-themed Halloween party on fire Island. 
As I recall, that was you. 
Mr. Donaghy, I am overwhelmed by 
the negligence and incompetence. 
It is an affront to your shareholders and, frankly, to the American people. 
Listen, Banks! 
Mr. Banks, you go and tell 
your president the truth. 
We don't need the government telling us how to run our industry. 
I've heard enough. 
Why do you have a gavel? This 
isn't the congress. 
I brought it from home. 
Congratulations, Liz Lemon. 
Now Angie wants a break. 
So instead of going to a hotel, or my houseboat, which I cannot find, I'm staying with the woman that started this problem in the first place. 
What? No. Tracy, that is not fair. 
Oh, yeah, there's a garbage bag in the hallway with a reef shark in it. 
Just put him in the tub with a reef. 
What's for dinner tonight? I want pierogies! 
Unfortunately, we're not gonna be able to find homes for all these animals. 
But, uh, you know, the most important thing is that you not become emotionally attached to any of them. 
I grew up on a pig farm, sir, where all the animals, even the birds that cleaned our teeth, were workers, not pets. 
I never even had a dog, 'cause, as my mom would say, you can't eat love. 
And as my mom's friend Ron would say, "the donkey died. 
You're the donkey now, Kenneth. 
Just another animal. 
Might as well be a rat. 
An adorable rat, who shows you it's okay to be scared during a thunderstorm. 
Why, it seems crazy to me to even give a dog like this a name. 
For example, bandit. 
And that's Reggie, and up there is digger, well, the dogs scheduled to be put down today have red tags on them. 
I will adopt all of them. 
Jonathan, call don Geiss' office and Les Winkler in corporate communications. 
Tell Susan Cunningham, Alan Junkin, Mark-Jack. 
What took you so long? 
Banks, you son of a bitch. 
You know, revenge is a dish best served cold, Jack. 
Like...sashimi. or pizza. 
You prefer cold pizza? 
The morning after, it's the best. 
Better than hot pizza? That's insane. 
You don't tell me what kind of pizza to like. 
You don't tell me anything anymore, Jack! 
It was a year ago that you kicked me to the curb. 
I began plotting my revenge that very day. 
I knew that I had to align myself with something more powerful than G.E. 
And since American idol is not on till January, that left the United States government. 
So I spent all last fall raising money, worming my way into the Obamas' inner circle. 
Oh, my god, Malia, he did not say that! 
Let's text him now. 
After the election, I could have had any ambassadorship I wanted. 
Even to the world's gayest country, Ireland. 
Instead, I suggested that I take on this task force. 
See, I had you in my sights the whole time. 
What kind of gun was that? 
It's a laser gun. It�s unstoppable. 
You listen to me, Banks. 
You keep your spray-tanned little hands off this company. 
Too late. 
Your testimony's gonna make headlines in every paper across the country tomorrow. 
But...it wasn't a public hearing. 
Somebody must have "weaked" it. 
You did. You "weaked" it! 
And I'm just getting started. 
By the time I'm done, you're gonna make AIG look like the Lehman brothers of microwaves. 
You would destroy an entire company just to get me? 
Think of the pensions, the employees, the kittens we use to test microwave strength. 
Enjoy the view while you can, Jack. 
You'll be here for about three days, tops. 
Oh, that's all I'll need, Banks, you watch me. 
I'll make this company profitable so fast, the only headline will be, "Donaghy saves G.E., marries your mom. 
�See you in a couple days, Jack. 
Laser shield. 
Tracy and Liz's residence. Tracy speaking. 
Tracy, it�s Jenna. Is Liz there? 
It's Jenna, from work. 
Jenna, it's 2:00 in the morning. What�s going on? 
Night stalkers has encountered some production speed bumps that are complicating my schedule. 
Well, I need you back by Friday. What kind of speed bumps? 
Well, Iceland appears to have a different sun than America, because this one is not setting. 
Ugh, yeah, of course, 'cause it's so far North. 
And you probably don't know this, because you've never played a moonologist, but werewolves only come out at night. 
Yes, I remember that from the thriller video. 
Too soon. 
What is your plan, Jenna? 
Well, evidently, as it gets later in the year the sun will start to set. 
I'm told tomorrow night we may get as much as a minute of darkness. 
Really? So you're gonna shoot this movie 
one minute at a time, just to punish me? 
Liz, I don't even know what you're talking about. 
What New cast member? Bye. 
No, you... 
What's wrong, roomie? 
Well, two of my coworkers are driving me insane, so I'm gonna kill them in their sleep tonight. 
Tracy and Liz's. Tracy speaking. 
Tracy, put Lemon on. 
Hello? 
Okay, as a single woman, would you be more inclined to buy a New microwave if it could be programmed to ask you about your day? 
Before you answer, consider your loneliness. 
I'm hanging up now. 
Now that we're all up, you want to talk about the elephant in the room? 
No, I don't. I don't even know 
why you brought that thing. 
I mean the figurative elephant! 
Liz, I been reading your book. 
Now I see why Angie's mad at me. 
"If your man has seven cell phones, but won't give you any of the numbers, that's a deal-breaker?" 
"If your man owns a diamond necklace that says open marriage, that's a deal-breaker!" 
Liz Lemon, every little thing I've done is in here. 
You used me to write your book! 
What? No, maybe some of 
it is inspired by you. 
You stole my life. 
And you're gonna pay for it. 
Really? 
You're gonna make my life worse than it is right now, how? 
I'll take all of them. 
Tracy and Jenna are like children. 
And like children, you can't reason with them when they're upset. 
All you can do is turn the heat up, pour some whisky in their juice, and wait for sleep to save you. 
Well, that's not gonna work for me, because Jenna is immune to whisky, and Tracy is afraid of juice. 
Oh, and not to add to your problems, but Paula read your book. 
Attention, creative types. Brainstorming Session. 
Let's try to stop mouth-breathing for one minute. 
What is this? 
It's an idea. An idea that started 
this company, changed the way we live, and made this country great. This is Dinesh Mehta. 
He's a design engineer from the microwave division. 
All Dinesh and I need from you is one idea that is as good as the light bulb. 
What? 
I have two days to make people buy a lot of microwaves. 
Well, it's kind of annoying when you're microwaving, like, a burrito, and the burrito won't rotate because it's too big. 
It just gets caught against the sides and the tray under it rotates, but it doesn't rotate. 
Bigger ovens. Americans 
like big, yes. What else? 
What if microwaves broke down more easily, so people would have to buy New ones more often? 
Yes, shoddier, excellent. 
Bigger and not as well-made. 
Wow, that sounds exactly like the philosophy that almost destroyed the U.S. auto industry. 
This isn't the auto industry, Pete. The auto 
industry was run by a bunch of out-of-touch White guys selling consumers a product they didn't want. 
We're G.E., damn it. 
And we're gonna make a giant, flimsy microwave. 
Frank, I can't! If I make it any 
bigger, the door will be too heavy. 
Fine! Forget it. 
Wait. 
Say that again. 
I said forget it. 
For...get it. 
Four smaller doors. 
We'll crack this yet "We�ll" crack this yet. 
Wheel. Put wheels on it. 
Nice. 
Donaghy Okay, it's go time. Are you ready? 
I'm in character and everything. 
All right, let's do this! The sun 
is setting! We get one shot at this! 
Thank you. 
And action! 
Claire, I'm sorry. Which hand did I have 
the flashlight in when we were inside? 
The right! You had it in the right. 
Thank you. 
Cut! 
Great day, everyone. 
You guys are the real stars. 
Since I have neither the time nor the energy to even pretend that your situation is a real problem. 
She doesn't like to refill the Brita. 
I will cut the baby in half. 
And I will take the top half. For 
that is the part with the face. 
Lemon, you wrote about Tracy's life for your own game. 
Tracy should be allowed to use your life as he sees fit. 
I'll have Jonathan call legal and get a life rights contract drawn up. 
Wait, what do you mean? Tracy 
will own my life story? 
What are you gonna do with my life story? 
Something humiliating. 
Thank you, Jack. 
Thanks a lot, Jack. 
It's your only move, Lemon. 
Sometimes the way back up down. 
Let me tell you a story. It's 1994. 
I went ice climbing, and I fell into a crevasse. 
I hurt my leg, and I couldn't climb back up. 
So fighting every natural instinct, doing the thing that seemed most awful to me, I climbed down into the darkness. 
And that's how I got out. 
And when I got back to base camp, I went and found my fellow climber, the one who had cut me loose after I fell, and I said, "Connie Chung, you did the right thing. 
Thank you. 
Climb down, Lemon. 
Climb down. 
Hey, you're back. 
Night stalkers is taking a brief, permanent hiatus. 
Well, maybe now we can talk. 
Jenna, I'm your friend, no matter what, and I will always oh, Liz, I would really love to do this. 
But I have to go home for the day. 
Gotcha. So you're sticking with 
the passive-aggressive acting out. 
No, it's not acting out. 
I have Mercury poisoning from obsessively taking my rectal temperature. 
And cup holders. Everyone 
loves cup holders. 
Okay, I've been up for the last 50 hours, but I think this is a good idea. 
Let's get rid of the oven entirely and replace it with an AM/FM radio. 
Okay, it's a car. We�ve 
invented the Pontiac Aztec. 
Thank you, Subhas. 
You are the deal-breaker! 
This is a Bill. 
Tracy. 
Hey, roomie. Did you order 
pay-per-view at my apartment? 
I'm willing to go splits-ies. 
I'm not paying for any of this. You 
ordered six adult movies in two days. 
"The curious case of Benjamin Butt." Lovely. 
"I'm a do us?" What does that even mean? 
That's a pun on Amadeus, dummy. 
I will not be judged by you. 
You caused this whole folderol. 
Until you're adequately debased, you will subsidize my predilection for erotica. 
Oh, yeah, and I used your credit card to buy a vocabulary course from the teaching company. 
So you're saying once you figure out how to get back at me, you and the dogs will leave my apartment? 
Affirmative. 
I have to climb down...into the darkness. 
I know what you should do with my life rights. 
Pete, keep tours out of the studio for the next couple days. 
I need you to build a set that looks like my apartment and get all the hand sanitizer you can find. 
Wait, wait, why do you need Tracy is producing a porno based on my life. 
And I'm writing it. 
I didn't think it would end like this, Jonathan. 
Not with a bang, but with a whimper a whimper indeed, Jack. 
I only came by to wish you luck on your New venture. 
What do you think that'll be? Selling fake weed to NYU students? 
I'll have you know that Barry Diller and I are working on a whole New approach to media, combining the digital - God! 
Just let me drink. 
See you around, Jack. 
Thanks for letting me be such a big part of you hitting rock bottom, huh? 
Not yet, Banks. 
I can go lower. 
Into the crevasse. 
What? 
You played this all wrong. 
You want to humiliate me? You want to destroy me? 
You should have walked in here with a check. 
Again, what? 
Sure, maybe you've ruined my career. Maybe you'll never see me again. 
But if you had forced me to take government bailout money, you'd be my Boss. 
Oh, my. 
You'd have to come down to Washington. 
Report to me, like a little school boy... 
Your hands sticky from candy. 
And the worst part is, I wouldn't even want the money. 
No, you wouldn't. Jack Donaghy 
taking welfare? It'd kill you. 
With so many jobs at stake. 
You'd have to take it. 
I'd make you. I'd make you take it all. 
I'd roll over and let you give it to me. 
I'm honestly not trying to make this sound gay. 
No one is. It�s just happening. 
One word to the president, and I own you. 
I own this office. 
I own that...fancy 
little fellow outside. 
It'd kill me. 
But I'd do it for the company. 
Hey Sasha, is your dad home? 
What? You have to invite everyone 
to your party? Even Zach S. 
Everyone settle. 
And action. 
It's not just about the new cast member. 
When you always put the show ahead of me, it makes me feel like we're growing apart. 
Jenna...you're my friend. 
No matter what. 
I will always look after you. That's not going to change. 
Oh, Liz, thank you for giving me the hotter porn Lady. 
Okay...we should get out of here. 
Yeah, we should. 
Everything good with Tracy? 
Yea, I think so. And Jenna and 
Frank and even Subhas. And you? 
I live to fight another day. But at what cost? 
Oh, boy, I know the feeling. What a week, huh? 
Lemon, it's Wednesday. But 
it's not all... 
Bad news. 
My retainer. Now my 
dad won't be mad at me. 
Take it out, Lemon! 
You take it out, Donaghy! 
Everything good with Tracy? 
I think so, and Jenna too, and Frank, and even subhas. 
And you? 
I live to fight another day. 
But at what cost? 
Boy, I know the feeling. 
What a week, huh? 
Lemon, it's Wednesday. 
But it's not all bad news. 
My retainer. 
How will I ever thank you? 
And cut. This is disgusting. Shut it down. 
﻿1 There's a lot of history in studio 4C. 
To catch a predator, the XFL halftime show, Storage for broken copier equipment, And now... 
Dealbreakers. 
Liz Lemon's got her very own talk show! 
 I'm a star   I'm on top   somebody bring me some ham  I used to sing that when I was a kid. 
Yes, well, it's really happening for you, Lemon. 
Between TGS and this, You're like a swarthy, big-hipped Kelly Ripa. 
I know. 
I mean, if this works, my life will be totally different. 
  I have to go back into space, Liz. 
I hope you enjoyed the kissing, followed by my genuine interest in that TV dance competition. 
Bye, astronaut Mike Dexter. 
Liz! Snap out of it! 
Jenna's locked herself in her dressing room! 
What? No, go away. 
This is my fantasy, Pete! 
I knew it. 
You're blonde in your fantasies. 
It looks terrible. 
Oh! 
Jenna, what's wrong? 
My niece drew a picture of me, and I look so fat! 
Well, I really like your hair today. 
Thank you! But you don't know what it 
looks like, because of the door! 
Wow, she finally figured that out. 
Okay, Jenna, you win. 
If you're really not feeling up to doing the show this week, I know that Jenny McCarthy is in town. 
My nemesis? 
Never! 
Oh, my god. 
I bet she put Charlotte up to this. 
Lemon, that is why Dealbreakers is going to work, because your star is a crazy person, and my star is you. 
And I am not crazy, because unlike Jenna, My mother never used my beauty pageant winnings to buy her married boyfriend a motorcycle. 
Exactly. 
Boy, if this thing works, it could be my ticket out. 
This job is starting to get to me. 
Lately, I've been shoplifting just to feel in control. 
'cause no one knows I took the candy bar. 
No one but Peter. 
 Liz Lemon, I need to talk to you. 
 What's up, Tray? 
Come over here and check out my corner. 
 No trap. 
 What? 
Come over here, I said... 
In my normal tone of voice. 
Liz Lemon, recently I realized that I have a hole in my heart, and not the one I got from eating batteries. 
It's 'cause I don't have a daughter. 
 Well, that's actually sweet. 
 I want a baby girl, Liz Lemon. 
I mean, havin' a daughter's Like goin' to the nba all-star weekend. 
It changes you. Makes you want to 
take your wife to the doctor. 
 Well, I think that's great, Tray. 
 I'm glad you feel that way, Because Angie's on her way up, and I want you to tell her for me. 
 Oh, no. I'm not doin' that. 
 Oh, yes, you are. Click. 
I said "click" to distract you from the sound of the handcuffs. 
 What? 
 Uhuh! 
Why are you handcuffed to the bookshelf I built for my husband? 
Tracy did this to make me tell you that he wants to have a baby girl. 
 You did good. 
 Really? Have you lost your mind? 
I'm not gonna raise another child by myself. 
What are you implying? 
I'm a very attentive father. 
Oh, please, tracy. 
Where were you last week during Tracy, Jr. 's birthday party? 
There was a better kid's birthday party up the street! 
I cannot believe you made me come here for this. 
Now I won't have enough time to shop for Christmas presents  and still get my hair did. 
 Your hair did? 
You just got your hair did! 
You have to get your hair did again? 
 It needs to be did every week! 
 Maybe we could undid these handcuffs. 
 Oh, cracker! 
 Racist! 
You know what? 
Keep your hair appointment. 
I'll do the Christmas shopping this year to prove to you I can be reliable and that I can finish everything that I No. Come back! 
Ah! 
Season 4 Episode 7 Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001 Listen up, dummies, I'm gonna be gone this week doing my talk show, so I need to leave someone responsible in charge. 
Now, it's not about who I like the most or who's the funniest, so it's Toofer. 
Oh, thank you. 
As Tennyson wrote, "I mete and dole unequal-" No, never mind. 
Lutz, you want it? 
Mm-hmm. 
Oh, okay. 
Too much pressure. 
Writers who never talk, Anyone want a promotion? 
Great! Frank, congratulations. 
You are the new boss. 
Awesome. 
A cool person in charge for once. 
My first act as leader, I'm telling them to take down the Internet firewall. 
We can surf porn again. 
 Wonderful, porn! 
 I like porn. 
Sir? 
A Mr. Adouche is on the phone. 
 I.M. Adouche? 
 I am a douche? 
Banks! 
What do you want? 
 Did you say it? 
 No, I knew right away. 
Aw, sure, you did. 
Well, D.C.'s great. 
So many men in uniform down here. 
If you're calling to check in on your bailout money, just read the budgets we sent. 
We're getting more efficient every day. 
Our health care costs are way down since we started putting something in the coffee to keep women from getting pregnant. 
It's funny, I have been reading the budgets, and I couldn't help but notice that you're doing a talk show  with your foureyed little friend. 
 That is a business decision. 
 She wrote a very popular book. 
 It doesn't matter. 
Do you know how bad that could look? 
Worse than me in capri pants... 
Which you'd think I'd be able to pull off 'cause I'm tall. 
What are you saying, banks? 
If this Liz Lemon project loses one penny, I am gonna publicly flog you like... 
Well, like me at the provincetown flogging festival. 
In other words, it had better work. 
But don't worry. 
She's just a writer with zero performing experience. 
It'll work. 
I'll make it work. 
 Moron says what? 
 What? 
What does he say? 
What? 
I need a special gift for my wife, something that says I'm responsible. 
 Something simple, classy. 
 I get itelegance. 
That's why people come to Yakov's Nubian Bling Explosion. 
Yeah, it's perfect. 
What's that? I want it! 
I forgot why I originally came in here! 
Oh, that belonged to Philip Michael Thomas, The actor who played Tubbs on Miami Vice. 
Sure. I know him from the 
secret black people meetings. 
Nah, I'm just kiddin'. 
He's not invited. 
 But who's "EGOT"? 
 "EGOT" is not a person, T.J. 
It's a goal. It stands for Emmy, 
Grammy, Oscar, and Tony, Four awards that Thomas planned on winning in his career. 
That's a good goal for a talented crazy person. 
Anyway, you wanted something special for your wife. 
Nah, that was earlier. 
I want this. 
So how you feelin'? 
Feelin' good? Ready to go? 
With dealbreakers? Yeah. 
The set looks great, I'm ready. 
We just need an audience. 
I just want to make sure we're not forgetting anything, because this has to work. 
Has to work? 
It's gonna work, right? 
Yes, because it has to. 
And because we've thought of everything. 
 What if you didn't wear your glasses? 
 What? You think it's not a good look? 
Well, I don't know. 
Are you married? 
 I'm just saying. 
 Well, I can lose the glasses. 
I just might not be able to read the teleprompter, and I can't wear contacts 'cause the doctor says my eyeballs are too pointy. 
What about Lasik? 
The show'll pay for it. 
 Okay, if you think it's a good idea. 
 Great. Now we're perfect. 
What if we change your name to Veronica St. Pierre? 
No, that's too much. 
Your hair... 
Is fine. 
 Marco! 
 Both: Polo! 
Ha! 
Marco! 
Tracy, put that sword down and help me take these gifts to the car. 
No need. I got something better than 
presents for you and the kids. 
I got us all this "EGOT" necklace for me. 
That's exactly what I was talkin' about. 
I send you out for gifts, and you go and buy that dumb necklace for yourself. 
It's not dumb. It's smart. 
This necklace is a life goal. 
I'm gonna win me a Emmy, a Grammy, a Oscar, and a Tony. 
What? 
Tracy, you've never finished a damn thing in your life. 
I am gonna "EGOT," for us, for the family, and especially for little Chewbaquina Jordan. 
Okay, Tray. You go out and 
win every one of those awards and prove how responsible you are, and I'll give you a daughter. 
But until then, I don't want to hear another word about your baby girl. 
Great. 
I'll be in touch. 
 You still using your Hotmail account? 
 Mm. 
One more... 
And done-zies. 
 Did it work? 
 Oh, I'm sure it did. 
This machine is a genuine... 
"Lasig"? 
Hmm, curious. 
Here. 
Can you read the top line over there? 
"Dear, Dr. Spaceman, 
thank you for your submission. 
"The New England Journal of Medicine does not publish X-rated cartoons. " 
Well, why not? 
It's so frustrating. 
But at least I heard it from a friend. 
So while we're here, what else do you want to do? 
Face burn? 
Bone morph? 
 Mouth peel? 
 No, thank you. I can't. 
I'm gonna be on TV this week. 
 Really? I think you mean radio. 
 No, I don't. 
What iswhat Why do people keep saying stuff like that? 
You seem nervous. 
I could give you something for that. 
But you know what? 
I'm not supposed to have sex with my patients. 
Your hair is... 
Fine. 
Hey, we're all going to Chuck E. Cheese's. 
It's divorced Hispanic mom night. 
I can't. 
I've gotta proof all these sketches, Figure out the rundown, then meet with props in... 
Ten minutes! 
Okay. 
Have a good night, Liz. 
Very funny. 
I'm not Liz! 
Ooh, ham. 
Mmm! 
That's good. 
I'd first like to thank my creative team For coming here on such short notice, And I'm sorry I'm four hours late. 
Dotcom, research update. 
I googled a complete list of all past "EGOT" winners. 
Listen to this. 
"Composer Richard Rodgers, "Composer Jonathan Tunick, Composer Marvin Hamlisch. " 
That's good raw data. 
Now turn it over to Grizz for analysis. 
They're all composers. 
Kenneth, synthesize Grizz's analysis. 
Mr. Jordan, you need 
to write one great song, A song whose success will get it featured on a TV show, and then a movie based on that TV show. 
and then a broadway play based on that movie. 
This is how I'm gonna get my baby girl! 
All I have to do is create the most popular song of all time. 
 I've started already  That's great, Tray. 
 It's all happening! 
It's all happening! 
Hi. 
You got a haircut. 
Oh, actually, I got three haircuts. 
The first two made me look nuts. 
Hey, do I say the word "camer-ah" weird? 
Camer-ah. 
I need to talk to you. 
I have an actress problem. 
Okay. Don't try to 
move the body yourself. 
No. It's Liz. 
I need dealbreakers to work. 
And yesterday, I told her that she shouldn't wear her glasses. 
Oh, no! 
Why did you do that? 
Jack, you don't know what it's like to be on camer-ah. 
You're vulnerable. 
You're exposed. 
It doesn't take a lot to send you over the edge. 
 This is Lemon. 
 Not anymore. You've created two lizzes, 
Regular Liz and performer Liz. 
You've got to lie to her, Coddle her, protect her from the real world. 
I get it. 
Treat her like The New York Times treats its readers. 
Guys, standards is saying no to the rubik's pube thing. 
What? 
 You look exactly like Liz. 
 What? Shut up. 
You've just never seen my reading glasses before, which I have to wear to read your dumb sketches. 
And I lost my hat after I threw it at a bus that wouldn't stop for me, Even though the guy could see me running. 
 What about the purse and sweater? 
 This is a bag For all the scripts I now have to carry, And I'm wearing a sweater 'cause the studio's cold. 
You know what? 
I don't have to explain myself. 
You dummies have no idea what it's like to be in charge. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be in my office trying to have it all! 
What is happening to me? 
Dealbreakers main titles, Take number 510. 
Okay, here we go. 
One more! 
This is the one! 
And action! 
Great, and smile. 
With your mouth. 
And raise the roof! 
Yeah, you look boy, you can do it! 
Good! 
Oh, my god. 
Break it down, break it down. 
Oh, yeah, yeah! 
Sassy. Sass it up. 
Wave to a friend. 
Wave like a human being. 
You remember waving? 
And blow a kiss. 
No, with your hands! 
And, uh... 
A little cleavage. 
Nope! 
And just have fun. 
Are you spinning a basketball? 
This is great. 
You look really relaxed. 
I'd watch this show. 
 Okay. 
 What's happening to her? 
Okay, Lemon, step in front of the high-def camera. 
Let's see what that looks like. 
No! No high-def, 
Uh, because of the camera. 
The, uh, gobos are really moraying, right, pete? 
Please step away! 
 I have a delivery for miss Lemon. 
 Oh, an opening night bouquet. 
 I wonder who sent that? 
 They're from devin banks. 
 Oh! 
 Banks? 
"F.E.M.A. Paid for these flowers because 
your show is going to be a disaster. " 
 Jack, what is this? 
 Oh, god! 
I got a tattoo that says "freedom" in Chinese, And for what? 
May I have a moment alone with Lemon, please? 
Okay, here's the honest truth. 
You're better at this than Oprah. 
I need a minute. 
Hello? 
I fully understand the irony of what I'm about to say, But I have locked myself in my dressing room, and I am not coming out! 
 people   shoodily bop bop bow, ba badaba do   love songs   tweedly dum, tweedly dum ah   bada doobity ba   about love   and cars   I've started already    boo bop boh   stop! 
Stop! It's all wrong! 
How could five of the most popular musical styles all played at once sound so bad? 
Mr. Jordan, I'm not sure 
you've thought this through. 
Oh, yeah, ken? 
What do you know about the pressures of "EGOT"- ing? 
I need to speak to someone who's been there, A fellow "EGOT"- er. 
Tracy, what are you doing? 
You're supposed to be in a fitting. 
Nerds! 
Is it me, or is Liz Lemon getting hotter? 
 Lemon, it's Jack. 
 Don't even bother! 
I've been on the other side of that door, Jack. 
You can't outsmart me. 
I know all the tricks. 
 It's like that movie, The Negotiator. 
 I didn't see that. 
In the end, the police chief turns out to be the bad guy. 
I didn't say I wasn't going to see it. 
Lemon, what is it going to take to get you out of there? What do you want? 
I don't want to do this show anymore! 
Shut it down! 
I can't do that. 
If this thing loses money, I may as well let banks play out one of his gay home invasion fantasies on me. 
Then I guess it's a standoff! 
And I want pizzas for all the hungry people in here! 
 So you tryin' to "EGOT," huh? 
 I gotta "EGOT," Whoopi. 
See, I made this deal with my wife. 
If I don't "EGOT," then I can't have another kid. 
You know, I got my "EGOT" on a bet too. 
That's why Arlen Specter had to change parties. 
You created the supermajority? 
Mm. 
I don't get it. 
Why is it so hard? 
I paid all these people to create the most popular song in the world for me. 
That's the problem right there. 
You cannot fake your way to a "EGOT," fool. 
You know, all these awards I got, I got for projects I believed in. 
 Wait! Is that a daytime Emmy? 
 It still counts. Girl's gotta eat. 
Listen, my point really is, it's gotta come from the heart, and then the awards will follow. 
 That's good advice, Whoopi. 
 Mmhmm. 
Say... 
Can I have a glass of water before I leave? 
 Yeah. Sure. 
 Thank you. 
Colored man, put it back. 
Put it down. 
Lemon, come out. 
Jack, I just got your business sext. 
What have you done? 
This is no time to play the blame game. 
Of course not. 
I'm not wearing my outfit. 
Jenna, you're the only one who knows what Lemon is going through right now. 
Help me. 
Well... 
I hate to even tell you this, but I've always wondered why you guys don't take the door off its hinges. 
That's not gonna work! 
 This changes nothing! 
 Lemon, I am hemorrhaging money right now. 
Your audience has spent the last hour listening to Kenneth tell cleaned-up versions of Garrison Keillor stories. 
Now, I understand performer Liz is freaking out, So I need regular Liz's help. 
 I don't know that she's here right now. 
 Lemon, I need regular Liz to tell that crazy bitch, performer Liz, to get out on the stage and give me something I can try to make money off of. 
Please. 
Hey, buddy, your hair looks nice. 
Don't try those tricks on me! 
 Oh, boy. 
 Okay, I know that it's been a hard day. 
I could have had it all, But you had to ruin it With your thinking! 
Come on. 
 you're a star   you're on top   somebody bring you some ham  You should kill yourself! 
 Good god, Lemon, what is that? 
 This is how I cry now, ever since you made me get that off-brand eye surgery. 
Lemon, what have we done to you? 
It's okay. 
Go home and get some rest. 
 I'll take the hit. 
 I can't let you do that for me. 
Let him go! 
  baby girl   you're the missing piece   the perfect fit   baby girl   you're the product of doing it   er-eeeee  Damn it, Tracy. 
That's what's in your heart? 
You sweet fool. 
Let's make a baby. 
Wait! 
If you really want a baby, I'll give you my gift. 
But I must warn you, I won't be around a lot, 'cause I'm "EGOT"- ing. 
 Aw, Tracy Jordan, you're an idiot. 
 I know. 
We're lucky people laugh when I say stuff. 
Both: So, uh, how are we doing? 
 And by "we", I just mean the two of us. 
 I'm okay. 
You shouldn't have said anything about my hair. 
I know that now. 
I think it will grow out nicely. 
I agree. 
I'm sorry that I ruined You didn't. 
I sold the opening titles. 
 Really? To who? 
 "Whom?" 
And from now on, whenever a television is on in the background of a Sheinhardt-Universal soap opera,  You will be on it. 
 I'm gonna be on TV on TV! 
You're back! 
Thank god. 
I missed you so much! 
Don't ever leave me again! 
I'm back. 
I'm back! 
Hey, fancy face. 
You scared me. 
I thought I was gonna lose you. 
 You can't get rid of me that easily. 
 That's me. 
 My wedding ring. 
 I found it on the beach. 
That's me again. 
What is the What is this TV show? 
It's very distracting. 
Now,remind me,did you just do the philadelphia cotillion, or did you also debut internationally? 
I'm happy to say that I don't even get that. 
 How was your trip? 
 Terrible. 
I had to give up my window seat to some sevenyearold who had to sit next to her precious mommy. 
What about the actual purpose of your tr? 
How is the search for the new cast member going? 
Okay. I saw a few good alternative 
comics in San Francisco. 
San Francisco? 
I asked you to find an actor from middle America,a real person. 
You're not going to find him in the people's gaypublic of drugifornia. 
Jeez,relax. I'm also setting 
up auditions in toronto. 
Canada? Why not just go to iraq? 
The television audience doesn't want your elitist east coast, alternative,intellectual,leftwing... 
Jack,just say Jewish. 
This is taking forever. 
Stop trying to amuse yourself and start thinking about what makes actual human beings laugh. 
Who wants... 
my puddings! 
Now that's what I'm talking about. 
What a dumb... 
oh,no,he's really hurt. 
Hey,tracy,did you hear? 
Fred dawkins,the incredibly overweight guy that pacman was based on died last night. 
I will eat a bowl of cherries and some ghost meat in his honor. 
Orange and black decorations? 
Is this halloween or princeton parents' weekend? 
I don't know whether to be scared or proud of my cousin. 
 It's halloween,sir. 
 Proud it is. 
But this "almost all saints' day" isn't gonna be much of a celebration. 
I just heard that worldfamous clog dancer jugbert cody has gone to a better place. 
He's in cabo? 
No,sir. He passed away. 
But at least he died doing what he loved... 
blogging on the huffington post. 
Two down,one to go. 
What do you mean? 
The rule of threes... 
celebrities always die in groups of three. 
You better be careful,tray. 
Yeah,right. That's not a real thing. 
This is gonna be the scariest princeton parents' weekend ever!

30 rock  s04e03 hey,I read your rewrite. 
Start over,you hack! 
Miss maroney,are you okay? 
Oh,I'm fine. 
Just reminding the writers who's boss. 
With this new actor coming in, I want to make sure I get taken care of. 
I'm not gonna be pushed aside and forgotten, like that time at my sister's funeral. 
Ma'am,I don't think bullying people is the way to get them to help you. 
This is show business. 
Being nice gets you nowhere. 
No. Being nice can get you everywhere. 
Florence henderson used to bake cookies for the brady bunch writers. 
And,in return,they wrote her the role of a lifetime, as her own grandma hutchins. 
I don't really remember the brady bunch,'cause I was too young. 
But being nice to the writers... 
interesting idea. 
Think about it. 
Excuse me,Mr. Donaghy. 
I wasn't sure if you were participating in this year's pumpkincarving contest, or,if like last year,I should go jump up my own ass. 
Same as last year. 
Uh,hang on. 
Kenneth,you're from georgia,aren't you? 
Stone mountain,sir. 
Although when the parcells first came to America, they lived in a town called sexcriminalboat. 
Do you think that's cherokee? 
Uh,no,I mean,you're a middle American,a Joe average. 
You're the only one around here who knows what ordinary people want. 
So tell me... what makes you laugh? 
The usual,I suppose. 
Two hobos sharing a bean... 
lady airline pilots. 
I remember,growing up in stone mountain, my whole family would go down to the chuckle hut. 
That's the local comedy club? 
Oh,no,sir. It's a chuckle hut. 
You see,the chuckle is the part of the pig between the tail and the anus. 
But at night,the chuckle hut becomes the laugh factory, and that's a comedy club. 
Lemon,cancel your trip to toronto. 
We're going to stone mountain,georgia. 
****** hey,Frank,what is this? 
It's an Evite to our halloween party. 
I don't want to do that again. 
Remember last year? 
Hey,I work across the street, and I saw you guys are having a halloween party. 
Yeah,we are. 
Could you close your blinds? 
You're really bumming all of us out. 
It's humiliating. 
Guys,we can't give up on halloween. 
It's a magical night where women dress slutty and drink too much, where we can hide our bodies in bulky costumes. 
We've got to keep trying. 
But we suck. 
Yes,but anything can happen on halloween. 
Up is down. Black is white. 
Good is evil. And evil... becomes good. 
Hey,writers. I baked you cookies. 
Jack! You have to help me. 
I'm gonna die any minute. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Celebrities. 
They always die in groups of three. 
Two already died,and I might be the next to go. 
That's ridiculous. 
I got to go somewhere where nothing will happen to me. 
Can you get me on Charlie rose? 
Tracy,you have nothing to worry about. 
The rule of threes is a myth that doesn't exist, like going bald with dignity. 
That said,I would prefer if you take the next one. 
So this all started when their plane crashed? 
That's lost. 
Oh,right. 
You know,I met j. J. Abrams once. 
And I don't know what this means, but he said the Island is just Hurley's dream. 
Why is jenna hanging out with us? 
'Cause she's freaking out about the new cast member. 
So she's trying to suck up. 
I don't like having her around. 
Don't worry. We'll get rid 
of her,one prank at a time. 
There my buddies are. 
Oh,wow,they painted the ceiling in here. 
We're going to find the perfect person for the show down here, someone who represents the real America. 
Jack,for the 80th time, no part of America is more American than any other part. 
You are wrong. 
Small towns are where you see the kindness and goodness and courage of everyday americans... 
the folks who are teaching our kids,running our prisons, growing our cigarettes... 
people who are still living by core American values. 
There are plenty of core American values in new York. 
But there are not restaurants called fatty fat sandwich ranch. 
Turn here. Turn here! 
Lemon,if this is going to play out like lunch, I suggest you crack your window now and save yourself the embarrassment in 20 minutes. 
Now,they have hush puppies here, which you might know better as a knish or a beignet. 
I know what you're trying to do,Jack. 
You want to paint me as this new York snob. 
Can I share with you my world view? 
I'd rather hear you sing rocket man again. 
All of humankind has one thing in common... 
the sandwich. 
I believe that all anyone really wants in this life is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich. 
What a surprise... your 
world view is foodbased. 
And who am I to say that my delicious Italian sub is better than its stone mountain equivalent? 
Which is why I will have the carp po'boy with extra chuckle. 
Keep refreshing. 
Maybe Andy dick has died in the last 20 seconds. 
Okay,I'll keep looking. 
No,I have to take matters into my own hands. 
 Hello? 
 Boo! 
Who is this? 
Hey,Betty,it's t. J. 
Tracy! 
I haven't seen you since that rappinggrandma movie we did. 
You were so funny as the rapping grandma. 
So how are you feeling? 
Any arm pain? 
Shortness of breath? 
Plans to investigate corruption in russia? 
Wait a minute. 
Are you calling because the pacman guy and jugbert cody died? 
 Is this a "rule of threes" call? 
 Um,no. 
Nice try,jordan,but I am going to be at your funeral. 
I will bury you. 
oh,this carp sandwich is not agreeing with my world view. 
Hello,there,folks. 
How y'all doing on this fine october... 
we have reservations under donaghy and lemon,and we need keys. 
Are y'all from new York? 
Yes. How can you tell? 
 New York people,always in a real big... 
 hurry,yeah. 
No,it's not because we're from new York. 
We're all the same sandwiches. 
You all have a beagle with you? 
Just give us our rooms. 
Oh,my God. 
Tell me about the peach festival. 
Oh,peach festival... 
they got peach preserves,of course, peach pie,peach wine,peach jerky... 
peach butter... 
unbelievable. 
I have to apologize. 
You know what they should do with people like her? 
They should round them all up and put them on an Island. 
Oh,wait,they already have. 
It's called Manhattan. 
Down here we call it sexcriminalboat. 
Maybe spend some photoshop there. 
Hey,Frank. 
Do you know sacha,Michael,and gay Michael? 
Can I ask you a question? 
Why? 
Oh,God,it's bad enough having jenna hang out here. 
Now she's bringing her friends? 
How can a dude in a midriff top dominate me like that? 
I like those guys. 
I might hang out with them on halloween. 
What? Why? 
Have you ever been to a gay halloween? 
It's amazing. 
Last year my girlfriends and I went to mario cantone's party in a renovated Barn in chelsea. 
So that's where all the girls are on halloween... 
at awesome gaydude parties. 
Oh,my God,we go so crazy. 
We kiss each other,get into vans,black out. 
I mean,I'm engaged,but not on halloween. 
Stop! Stop filling jenna's 
wigs with raw shrimp. 
 Why? 
 We need to pretend to be jenna's friends for the next 24 hours. 
She's our ticket to a gay halloween. 
How come when jenna suggests it,everybody's on board? 
No,lutz. Jenna attracts gay guys. 
Gay guys throw awesome halloween parties. 
Hot girls go to awesome halloween parties. 
Ergo,if we're jenna's friends... 
we spend halloween... 
 with hot girls. 
 With gay guys... 
hot girls. 
God,are you doing this to me 'cause I took that blind guy's hot dog? 
Who was at the door? 
You probably know him as "hick at the reception desk," but his name is travis hoagle, and,uh,he brought you something for your stomach. 
What is this? "peppy bismilk"? 
Why is everything a little different here? 
 I hate it! 
 You hate it? You hate travis hoagle... 
choir member,desert storm veteran,father of three? 
I made all that up,but you get my point. 
Do you even care that I am not feeling well? 
Of course I do. 
There,there. 
Thank you. That's nice. 
Well,I'd love to stay and do this all night, but one of us has to go to the laugh factory. 
No,I don't want you going there alone. 
Yes,you do. 
The people here... they're the 
audience we're trying to reach. 
I get them. I know what they want. 
I'm gonna find somebody great tonight. 
Hey,Rick,what's the difference between your girlfriend and your truck? 
I don't know,pumpkin. 
What is the difference? 
Your truck don't yell at you every time you get gas. 
Wonderful. Bravo 
hey... actor friend. 
So what are we all doing together for halloween? 
Oh,well,sacha and the michaels usually have a party. 
Oh,'cause lutz and toof and I always have a party. 
Hang on. 
What if we combined parties, threw one big party here in the studio? 
 Is that crazy? 
 No. Let's do that. 
Yes. 
That gesture. 
I like people who do that. 
A party with them? 
Oh,don't look at me like I'm a football game. 
I need those guys. 
I've been using them to make sure I'm taken care of when the new actor gets here. 
Girl,I don't even have the energy to tell you what's happening here,so read my face. 
Oh,my God! 
They're using me to get invited to gay halloween so they can meet hot girls. 
In metro news,Mary Hillman is going to gaffney for the weekend and hopes that Martha or stephanie will water her plants. 
And now an update on... 
very small town. 
Morning,lemon. I 
brought you a ginger ale. 
"Schwupps ginny pale"? 
This place is the worst. 
Don't worry. We're leaving. 
Our work here is done. 
In entertainment news, local funnymanand subshop owner Rick Wayne has been hired by a catholic to appear on tgs with a black fella. 
 What? 
 Hear me out. 
We're hiring Rick Wayne and pumpkin. 
It's a ventriloquist act. 
Oh,I'm too sick to handle this. 
See,you think you're not this prejudiced,arrogant new yorker, but you are,because in your mind, a southern ventriloquist act can't be funny. 
But you know who does think it's funny? 
These people... these 
wonderful,folksy,simple... 
stop calling them simple. 
You know what? You're the prejudice one. 
Sure,some of these people are simple, but some of them are smart,like matlock... 
or wholesome,like elly mae clampett. 
And some of them are skeevy dirt bags like the dukes of hazzard, driving around like maniacs. 
Children use those roads. 
My point is americans are the same everywhere in that we are all different. 
You're wrong,lemon. 
These people are better,purer. 
Do you know what I did this morning? 
I assisted in the birth of a foal. 
They named it Jack. 
And it was delicious. 
I know what I'm doing here,lemon. 
We're hiring Rick and pumpkin. 
We're not hiring anyone until I see them. 
Good God,lemon,your breath. 
When did you find time to eat a diaper that you found on the beach? 
Hi,I'm trying to get to studio 6b from here. 
I'm still finding my way around. 
You look clean. 
You a celebrity? 
I have my own show on NBC. 
No. Celebrity. 
I was in a movie with queen latifah once. 
Perfect. 
I'll show you the shortcut. 
Okay,you're sure this is the right way? 
Yes,queen latifah's friend. 
I'm sure. 
Mr. Jordan! 
Are you trying to kill Mr. 
Fallon with that hammer? 
What the hell? 
Is this a "rule of threes" thing? 
Not cool,guy. 
I'm sorry,Ken. 
But I want to live. 
Mr. Jordan,you're going to be fine. 
There is no rule of threes. 
 Iook out! 
 Okay,okay,truce. Truce,okay? 
But if some celebrity doesn't die soon, I'm gonna kill my first guest tonight. 
It's a dog who plays soccer. 
Really? That's your first guest? 
Yeah. 
Pete,I'm not gonna let this happen. 
But what can you do? 
Well,Jack says I'm just an obnoxious new yorker, so that's what Rick Wayne is gonna get tonight. 
And it's gonna get ugly. 
What are you... 
oh,my God,you're gonna heckle him, like that time I invited you to see my cover band. 
Yeah,and today the world is better off without the Pete hornberger Alan Parsons project project. 
I may be dehydrated. 
I may still be working a little chuckle out of my system,but don't worry. 
When I'm done,the last thing Rick Wayne and pumpkin are gonna want to do is come to new York. 
You guys,I am so excited. 
I already put on my costume. 
Get it? I'm an Italian senator. 
Don't you love it? 
It's gonna be awesome. 
And with one word,I can make it all go away. 
Wait,wwhat are you talking about? 
Oh,cut the crap. 
You boys are just pretending to like me to get in on gay halloween. 
Okay. What do you want? 
I want two good sketches a week, a promise to hate the new cast member, and no more making fun of me when I misuse dated cultural references. 
Okay? Are we cowabunga on this? 
 Fine,we're... we're cowabunga. 
 Good. 
But if I wake up in any of your apartments tomorrow morning, you will buy me breakfast. 
All right,the last pig is in the chuckling chute. 
And we're now the laugh factory. 
We got a great show for y'all tonight, and we're gonna get right to it with stone mountain's own Rick Wayne and pumpkin. 
All right,you asked for it. 
 Good evening,everyone. 
 How y'all doing? 
Hey,this your first time doing this? 
I'm sorry,I didn't know it was filthy, thinlipped hooker night here at the laugh factory. 
Okay. I underestimated you. 
Knock,knock. Who's there,pumpkin? 
A ferretfaced skank. 
Yep,I see her too. 
Get a job,hayseed. 
Are you still talking? 
You are one mouthy bitch. 
I don't go down to where you work and stop them from milking you. 
I'm sorry,but that's enough,sir. 
You're out of line. 
I'll tell you what's out of line. 
Your old lady's knockers. 
Good lord,woman. I 
wouldn't you with elmo's. 
Rick,pumpkin,what are you doing? 
A gentleman,whether he's human or somehow more than human, does not speak to a lady like that. 
You two are wholesome and decent. 
Oh,I get it. You think 'cause we talk 
like this,we're all simple and quaint. 
Well,I'm an amateur astronomer,and Rick's black wife speaks French. 
Her name's jamilla. 
See,I told you. There's 
no "real America. 
" You shut that dog rectum you call a mouth? 
Yes,sir. 
Why are you people laughing at this? 
You're supposed to be better,nicer,but you're terrible. 
You're all terrible,just like the people in new York. 
All God's children are terrible. 
Terrible,huh? I got a 
question for you there,pal. 
Do you ever find smaller heads orbiting your head? 
Is that a comment about the size of my head? 
I'm a tall man,and it's proportional to my frame. 
Your frame? What are they 
building there... a super walmart? 
You come down here and say that. 
I can't. I got a man's arm stuck up me. 
But you know what that's like. 
I can't believe I bought a fatty fat sandwich franchise! 
Oh,God,he's murdering me. His 
head is so much bigger up close! 
The deal's off,Wayne. 
Lemon,to the kia sorrento!

Oh. The cleaninglady's here. 
Please come back later.No polish. 
I live here.What're you doing? 
Oh. Haven't you heard?The 
building's going condo. 
If you're planning on buying,i'm wendy. We should talk. 
Well, I'm not buying,and they can't just kick me out. 
No, they can't,but they can hike your rent up. 
Way up. 
Let me show youthe bedroom. 
Jack will tell youwhat to do next. 
What? 
Thanks, cindy.All right, now 
we'regonna work those glutes. 
Hey, do youhave a minute? 
Good god, lemon,have you seen this? 
As I'm sure you'veconcluded from the headline,don geiss'sestranged son bertram is suing hishalfsister kathyfor control ofthe geiss family trust fund. 
They could've done,"geiss screams, son pay!" 
you know, like,ice cream sundae. 
This makes me sickto my stomach, lemon. 
Don geiss is my hero,my mentor, a great man. 
Holding up one fingerto get someone to stop talking...He invented that. 
 I don't think... 
 And now... 
He's being publicly humiliatedby his own family. 
This is y I'm gladI never had children,and why I never will. 
Oh, jack,you don't mean that. 
Geiss also invented the abruptconversational segue. 
Talk aboutyour thing now. 
Okay, well, um,my building is going condo. 
And they're tryingto drive the renters out?Are you going tobuy your place? 
Well, I love my builng,but if I gonna buy a place it should be a big placewhere I can have a family. 
Then spend someof your dealbreakers money.Buy two apartments. 
What? 
You know whymy place is so big? 
When I was first married to myexwife we were in the basement. 
Over the years I keptbuying the floors above me to make room for the familyI thought we'd have. 
Well, now I havesomething better than a family. 
A walkin humidor,a lap pool, and a replica of the irish pubwhere my grandmother was born. 
Well, I'm not rich, jack. 
You're doing okay.And this 
could beyour dream apartment. 
Sniff around yourupstairs neighbor,see if he'sanning to leave. 
If he's not, make him an offerhe can't refuse.Trademark 1974,

Oh, my god! Frank! 
Were you gonna peein that jar? 
I didn't knowanyone was here. 
That's what youuse the jars for? 
You told methat was sun tea. 
Some of themare sun tea, and some of themwere sun tea. 
Do you know about this? 
We havea gentleman's agreement. 
He gets the jars,and in return he's agreed to let a yale sweatshirtbe our desd fart dampener. 
What is wrongwith you guys? 
What would it be like if cerieand sue and I were not here? 
We'd have a room dognamed meatus. 
I'd take my pants offand eat chicken wings. 
Shut it down.Throw away the jars. 
Fine, but I'mgonna recycle them, and then one day as youdrink some apple juice,you'll wonder,"where has this jar been?" 
I will fight my sister toothand nail to get what I deserve because i, bertram geiss,am still daddy's fancy boy. 
After the deposition,kathy geiss's lawyeroffered this rebuttal. 
My name is teddy ruxpin.Can 
you and I be friends? 
Mr. Donaghy,you wanted to see me? 
Kenneth,I have a task for you. 
Is it menial? 
As part of nbc's annualgreen week initiative,has to reduceits carbon footprint. 
I'm putting youin charge that effort. 
Global warming, sir? 
I'm sorry, that's justa bunch of scientist talk. 
Same peoplewho'd have you believe that my greatgrandfatherwas a monkey. 
If he was a monkey, then whywas he killed by a monkey? 
You're preachingto the choir, kenneth. 
I mean, I love the earth.I 
have these rarekadupul blossoms flown in every morningfrom sri lanka on a private jet. 
That's the definitionof green.And 
yet they force usto do more. 
More sacrifices.Why? For the children. 
What have childrenever done for us? 
Well, they makeour shoes and wallets. 
I need a 5% reductionof energy use across the board. 
I'll do itif you insist, sir. 
But I'm gonna be grumpyuntil the end this sentence. 
Hi, I'm liz,and I live right below you. 
Oh, my god.I'm brian. Come in. 
Wow, this placeis great. 
Isn't it?New kitchen,original molding, 
and I have a view because thatdentist blew up his townhouse. 
So... You gonnatry and bribe me like 
the rest of theseyuppie bottom feeders? 
What? No. Bribe?People do that? 
Yeah, well,the guy above me offered me ten grandto move out. 
That's a lot. 
It's obscene.This 
neighborhoodused to be real. 
Now it's all chain storesand fancy restaurants. 
Yeah, we cool peoplegot to hold our ground. 
Fight the man.Michael moore, et 
cetera.Is thata working fireplace? 
Yeah, but it'skind of annoying.I can't ut the flue, 
so the apartment smells likeburger king all day and cinnabon all night. 
Yeah, I just came up hereto make sure you're staying. 
Ruining things for those creepsg to make duplexesfor their imaginary children, and their imaginary husband,astronaut mike dexter. 
So what's your plan? 
I don't know. Just 
figuresomething out, I guess. 
Look,what if we team up? 
What do you mean? 
I can't affordto stay here on my own, and based on yourshoes and teeth,i'm guessingyou can't either, so why don't wemove in together? 
I mean, you'd have togive up your place'cause this isthe twobedroom. 
There's two of them? 
oh! Is that bad?Oh, god. 
So now you're your ownupstairs neighbor. 
What's the plan? 
Well, I'm gonna pretendto move in with brian,somehow drive him out, then buy both placesand make my dream apartment. 
That sounds like something I'dcome up with if I was smarter. 
I know, I'm terrible.But brian sucks. 
He doesn't have a tv and hewears political tshirts. 
Don't feel guiltyfor a second.This 
is manhattanreal estate. 
There are no rules.Like 
checkinat an italian sex party. 
I mean,do you know how long I've been waitingfor the lady next door to finally joinher husband in hell? 
Hello, Mrs. Gerstein. 
Oh, my heart...Is 
getting strongerevery day. 
Oh, you ancient bitch! 
But you've alreadygot a foot in the door. 
Here's whatyou're gonna do. 
Do you rememberthat horrible roommate you had back in chicago? 
You mean you? 
I know it's my turnto do the dishes,but I'm in character, and if you make me do the dishesI will kill myself! 
You drove a lot of guysout of that third bedroom. 
Becauseguys hate drama.And I'm gonna 
teach youhow to be a drama queen. 
And if I fail,i'm gonna take a bunch of pills,and it's gonna be your fault! 
Still got it. 
Lemon, I justwant to make sure you're not making any jokesabout don geiss this week. 
Don't worry,ack.Our topicalcold open is 
aboutomarosa borrowingbjork's swan dress. 
Tracy. 
What's up, donaghy? 
Tracy jr.,to what do we owe this visit? 
It's "take your black kidto work day." 
Do you everregret having children? 
Every day. 
I thought having a family wasgonna be like the cosby show. 
Oh, no,vanessa nto a concert! 
Oh, no, rudy and I are makinga sandwich for 25 minutes! 
The cosby show was a lie.Having 
a familycan be the worst. 
For example,I have this strip club story from this weekendI need to tell you, jackie d. 
It is disgusting. 
But I can't becauseI got this little dbag, here. 
I know what that means. 
And yet youwon't tell me. 
I've been thinkinga lot about family lately, about my legacy. 
I've been watching a friendgo through an ordealwith his children,and it has only affirmed that I was not meantto have any of my ownand that I never will. 
It's not that simple. 
Now, what if a girltries to trap you like nicole tried to do meon the band trip? 
Bitches can be tricky. 
I'm going to getsome strawberry milk. 
Tracy jr.'s right.There's only one way 
to reallytake children off the table. 
I'm going to geta vasectomy. 
.I mean, that's a bigecision! 
Having a family is alsothe best thing a man could... 
He's gone.So my story. 
So I'm in the strip club with charles barkleyand one of the hobbits. 
Hey, daddy. 
Damn it!I n't live like 
this!I'm gettinga vasectomy too! 
Excuse me, Miss maroney. 
Kenneth, I'm doingy kegelsright now. What is it? 
Well, I've beenput in charge of reducing tgs's carbon footprint. 
And everyonehas to chip in. 
Kenneth, I oncetook a lowvolume shower with ed begley jr. 
What more can I do? 
Well, let's see. 
Minka kelly says,"my show is about football. 
"there's a football teamcalled the chargers.Unplug your chargers." 
But kenneth,I need all of these. 
This one's for my cell phone,this one's for my laptop, this one'sfor my erotic massager,and this one'sfor something personal. 
A vasectomy is a veryserious decision. 
I want to make sure you'veboth tught this through. 
I have,I've thought about it,and I've decided thatI don't want to have children. 
Family planning.And 
what about you, tracy? 
the cosby showlied to me. 
I don't think there'sa box for that on the form. 
Uh, what about"cheers lied to me"? 
Okay.Now, for the procedureyou can 
choose between localor general anesthesia. 
I should warn youthat general anesthesia can cause powerfulhallucinations. 
So highly recommend it.I'll 
scheduleboth of you for the morning. 
Now, this is surgery, so don'teat anything before you come in, because I'll havea big breakfast waiting for you. 
Until tomorrow,gentlemen. 
We all see the little, black boyin the corner, right? 
Okay. 
Hey, liz. 
Made you a mailbox key. 
So is thatall you have to say to me?That's how you apologize? 
What? What did I do? 
What do you care?Whatever, 
brian, I am over it! 
Over what? 
 It! 
Oh, I'm sorry,is it too much drama? 
You remind me of my fatherand my boyfriend! 
Ugh! Are you listening to 
me?Because if you are not, 
I will put on a wedding dressand jump in front of a subway! 
Honey, you don't needto tell me how much men suck. 
Sit downand tell me everythingwhile I make usraspberry mojitos. 
You're gay? 
Start from the beginning.What's 
this boyfriend's na astronaut mike dexter. 
Hi, tracy.I thought "take your 
black kidto work day" was yesterday. 
No, it's alwaysa wednesday. 
Brian is gay, jenna.The drama 
did notmake him want to move out. 
Well, of course not.Drama 
is likegay man gatorade. 
It replenishestheir electrolytes. 
Damn it,he's never gonna leave. 
Trying to getsomeone to move out? 
May I suggest what gotmy neighbors to move out? 
Black person moved in,scared 'em off. 
Huh. That's nota bad idea, tracy. 
I got a lotof good ideas.Now 
if you'll excuse me, I have to take my sonto my vasectomybecause the cosby showlied to me and I cannot tellan amazing strip club story. 
Okay, let's go. 
Miss lemon.As I'm sure you 
know,it is green week, and nbc... 
Oh, brother, are they actuallygonna do something this year, or are they just gonna putthat stupid green peacock in the cornerof the screen? 
Actually, we're reducing tgs's carbon footprint. 
And what you can do,miss lemon,is get rid of youroffice mini fridge. 
My mini fridge?What about my fresh 
fruit?...flavored toastercheesecakes? 
Oh, so I guess you canmake other peopl stuff up, but you're too goodto make a sacrifice yourself. 
Fine, I'll give upmy mini fridge because unlike frankI am a good d decent person. 
Is that my cell phone? 
Oh, no, sorry.It's in my hand. 
Count backwardsfrom ten. 
Sure.I know how to do that. 
You lied to me, bill cosby!You lied to me! 
Uhoh, here comesmy hallucination. 
Denise. Vanessa?Sondra the 
boring one.'s your father. 
I'm having a cosby show hallucination. 
Hey, dad. 
Theo,what's going on here? 
Did rudy make a messwith the juicer again? 
Vanessa was supposed tobe watching her and not upstairsgossiping on the phone. 
Who are rudyand vanessa? 
Your adorable sisterand your sister. 
I don't have any sisters, dad. 
it's just us guys. 
You know how it iswhen it's just us guys, right? 
That's why my lifeis not like the cosby show. 
I only have boys,and boys are disgusting! 
I need a baby girl. 
Don't patronize me! 
Stop laughing!It's not funny! 
I need a baby girl!Don't 
snip my vas deferens! 
Looking... Things! 
Hey, what'reyou doing home? 
Oh, just gettingmy computer.Sorry, 
I forgot you'dbe home now, brian! 
Elizabeth,I know you're in there. 
Oh, no.It's my crazy black 
boyfriend,astronaut mike dexter. 
Better not be with a man!Even if he's gay! 
Mike, no, I don't evenknow why I'm letting you in when you're in thisunreasonable state. 
Don't get angryand jealous, even though brian is the onewho convinced me to move on. 
I'm gonna be coming byall the time, gettin' jealous,takin' thingout of context. 
That dude brianwould be happier moving out! 
Okay, everybodyjust calm down. 
I feel angry! 
Like warren moonmust've felt back in 1995! 
As I have told you many timesduring our relationship, no one getsthat reference. 
Oh, lord! 
Nypd!Stay on the ground! 
A gay hipster cop.You're 
aninteresting guy, brian. 
Look at this. 
The geiss name used to besynonymous with success, power, funny incidentswhere women died at barbecues. 
Now it's beingdragged through the mud. 
This is whyi'm having a vasectomy. 
Yeah, but lookat that picture. 
He had some good timeswith his kids too. 
That junk is priceless. 
Well, I'm glad I'm doing this.Very, very glad. 
What are youworking on now? 
I have to write an essayabout my dad for school. 
I wanted the cover to beone of those things where each letter in his namestands for a word about him. 
That's calledan "acrostic." 
An acrostic. Cool.Thanks 
for teaching me that. 
Yes, well,you're welcome. 
Maybe I could help youwith the grammar.Why don't youread it to me? 
"T" is for terrific,"r" is for rad, "a" is for awesome,"c"... 
'cause he's my dad. 
Damn you, tracy jr. 
Miss lemon, your mini fridgeis still in your office. 
You made a promiseto masi oka. 
"conserve electricity.Don't 
be a zero,be a good guy." 
Why doesn't thatsay "hero"? 
That feels likea real missed opportunity. 
I don't care.If I can't 
havemy adult apartment, I will havemy mini fridge. 
Wow, liz.Don't you 
careabout the environment? 
Shut up. What do you 
knowabout the environment? 
Only everything. 
Ladies and gentlemen,I present to you the greenest person at tgs,mr. Frank rossitano. 
He neverwastes anything.I've 
seen himeat food from the trash. 
What's a trash barrel but a big salad bowlfilled with trash? 
He never wastes waterby doing his laundry. 
This shirtstarted out white. 
No, do not encourage this. 
He pees in jars and leaves themaround the office.That's a health hazard. 
Come.Let me show you something. 
Don't talk to melike that.You look 
like a turtlewho lost its shell. 
Mr. Rossitanohas actually been 
emptying his jarsout there. 
He's been pouring themout the window? 
Oh, that is... 
Beautiful. 
Miss lemon,tgs can reach its 5% goalin one of two ways. 
You can give upyour mini fridge, or you can let Mr. 
Rossitanodo his sun tea system. 
Just keepthe door closed. 
Absolutely not. 
Wake up, tracy!Wake up! 
I don't want a vasectomy,dr. Spaceman. 
I need to goback in time. 
Why did I sellmy delorean to Mr. T? 
You'll be fine, tracy. 
I didn't let leogo through with the vasectomy. 
If a patient's friendruns into the operating room and yells at you,you have to stop.It's the doctor's code. 
Jackie d,I need a baby girl! 
Maybe one day our kidswill play together. 
I didn't havemy vastomy either. 
Tracy, I wantto have children.I want 
those memories,no matter what t cost. 
And I have to pass onthis head of hair. 
What made youchange your mind? 
Tracy jr. Made youan acrostic. 
Well, I hope he makes mean across helmet so I don't get hurtplaying across! 
Now, come on,that's pretty solidfor a guy who just cameout of an hallucination. 
Hey, how'd everything gowith dotcom? 
Terrible, actually. 
Well, what're yougonna do now? 
I give up. 
I can't jack, jenna, or tracythis guy out of the apartment. 
I'm out of... Ideas. 
I got the apartment! 
You did? How? 
He moved out,and now it's mine. 
You didn't reallyanswer my question. 
What? 
What did you do? 
You didn't! 
Manhattan real estate.No rules, right? 
You thinki'm disgusting? 
I used the sun tea systemto stop global warming. 
You used it to kick a gay copout of his apartment. 
I have no regrets! 
No regrets! 
Hey, tracy. 
Now you can tell meyour filthy strip club story. 
Frank, I'm gonnahave a daughter,and I would nevertell that story. 
It's demeaning to women. 
Especially if they've had theirboobies sneezed on by a tiger. 
Good for you, sir. 
Did you knowthat fluorescent light bulbs last ten times longerthan regular ones? 
Yup. And they only useone 
quarter of the power. 
But if we're gonnasolve the climate crisis, we've got to change more thanthe light bulbs and the windows. 
We've got to changethe laws and the policies through collective politicalaction on a large scale. 
You know, there's an oldafrican proverb that I made up. 
If you want to go quickly,go alone. 
If you want to go far,go together. 
We need to go far.Quickly. 
Mr. Vice president. 
The snack tableisn't gonna clean itself. 
Look again, kenneth. 
Well, that's notsuper helpful. 
Kenneth, encourageyour lawmakers to take action, and recycle everything. 
Including jokes. 
I'm sorry, sir, what? 
Quiet. 
A whale is in trouble.I have to go. 
Sir, I'm happy to report that TGS reduced its carbon footprint by seven percent. 
Kenneth, I also wanna do my part. 
You do? I may not have 
children anytime soon. 
But when I do, I want the earth here. 
That's why I replaced my wasteful imported flowers with beautiful azaleas from my very own 30 rock terrace. 
Oh my They're still sprinkled with morning due, Kenneth. Smell them. 
Smell my flowers, Kenneth. 
******** ******** ******** I also bought this.   
A chinese knockoff of your book. 
What? 
"dealbreaker: the book for you man no good,by lesbianyellowsourfruit. 
" so,uh,what do you need from me? 
Ah,well,our new cast member starts today. 
Oh,of course,the robot.  I liked him. 
We don't know anything about him. 
I don't think his real name is partybot. 
I don't know what he looks like. 
 I don't know what he talks like. 
I certainly don't know if he can act. 
Lemon,what did you once say to me about acting? 
Just hit your marks,stay in your light, and do the same thing every take for continuity. 
See?  Anyone can do it. 
Miss lemon,security called.  
Our new actor just checked in. 
He'll be on six in a couple minutes. 
Let's go introduce ourselves. 
This is so exciting. 
Maybe we should practice the welcome song i distributed. 
?makin' a new friend 
??sure ain't easy ?? 
and that's how two become one ? 
lemon,do you have any plans for dinner tonight? 
I do,i bought an activia microwavable panini. 
Good god,have dinner with me. 
 Just the two of us?  - Yes.  - Okay. 
Hey,jackie d. 
I hope the new dude isn't impossible to work with, like some people i know. 
 I hope he's educated.  
 I hope he hates toofer. 
I hope he likes janitor hugs. 
Somebody's coming. 
Oh,no.  Is that the new guy? 
What?  No,it's me,lutz. 
I've worked here for three years. 
I gave you that car i won. 
Come on. 
Hi.  I think i'm supposed to be on tv. 
Jack donaghy.  Good to see you again. 
Oh,hey.  I'm jack...  Baker. 
So guess there's two jacks here now. 
I don't think there are. 
Welcome aboard...  Danny. 
Hi,danny.  I'm liz. 
Did he just change my name? 
Let's go look at your dressing room...  Danny. 
He looks like all the guys in my magazines. 
This is unbelievable. 
Last week,i was just a street performer making 50 bucks a day and getting memory loss from all the silver paint fumes,and now i'm...  Um... 
 You're on tgs.  
 I'm on tgs? 
This is unbelievable! I 
haven't done any real acting since i was in that high school football movie back in ottawa. 
You're canadian? 
All right,hosers,i want all 12 of us fighting for every meter on all three downs! 
We're gonna make this a boxing day the prime minister will never forget! 
Okay,well,you don't have zero experience. 
I just don't want to screw up. 
Like,what do you wish you'd known on your first day here? 
Oh,well,don't eat prop food. 
They spray something on it that messes you up. 
Hello,mr.  Baker. 
I'm kenneth,one of the nbc pages. 
I'm going out to get miss maroney and mr.  Jordan's lunch. 
And what would you like? 
Oh,thanks.  I'll probably 
just go grab something later. 
Can i get you anything while i'm out? 
Yad sdrawkcab tsuj s'ti sseug i,yako. **

30 ROCK Season 4 Episode 05 ??okay,here's one. 
You can have the powers of superman for an entire year, but you can only have one sexual partner for the rest of your life. 
Two questions: must i live by superman's moral code, and will the sex woman get older? 
 Yes and yes.  
 Forget it.  No deal. 
I don't want your sleeve to catch on fire. 
Why would my sleeve catch on fire? 
You know me well,sir. 
I often know what you're going to do before you do it. 
 What am i going to do next?  
 What am i going to do next? 
Speaking of which,i made some calls. 
And there's interest in a dealbreakers talk show with you hosting. 
Spit take.  Are you serious? 
Absolutely.  You're 
becoming a commodity. 
I say we book the studio,shoot the pilot, and take it from there what do you think? 
Wow,okay.  Let's do it. 
 i knew you would say yes,lemon.  
 i knew you would say yes,lemon. 
Hey,pete,i have question. 
Is camera left my left or my right? 
Here's some advice,danny. 
Learn as little as you can. 
'Cause when you know things,people ask you to do things. 
And then everyone starts coming to you with their problems. 
That's why when someone comes to me with something i don't want to deal with, i say,"oh,no,my kid's sick," and take off. 
You have any kids?  No. 
I mean,i pretty much raised my little sister, 'cause my mom ...that 
must have been hard. 
no,my kid is sick. 
A dealbreakers talk show?  That's amazing,liz. 
Liz lemon,you are blowing up like a balloon with a grenade in it. 
Who else are you meeting with? 
What do you mean? 
You know,like producers and agents. 
No onei'm doing it with jack. 
 For sheinhardtuniversal. 
Liz,you can't just go with the first person who comes along. 
I know,because i've been burned. 
Do you remember when i was first starting out, and i signed a tenyear deal with that karaoke machine company? 
??when i first got big,i made 
bad business decisions too. 
Which is how i got stuck having to plug wade bogg's carpet world five times whenever i appear on screen. 
You have to plug what? 
Wade bogg's carpet world. 
Wade bogg's carpet world. 
 Wade bogg's carpet world. 
Liz,jack would never take a first offer,right? 
He's taking advantage of your relationship. 
He knows you're special,like a black stripper with blue eyes. 
You have to test the marketplace. 
But i already told jack that i would do it with him. 
Did you sign anything? 
Then he'll understand.  It's business. 
I'm gonna set you up with someone at my agency and make sure that you do this right. 
And one last piece of advice,liz lemon, from someone that's been on this side of the business for a long time. 
Wade bogg's carpet world. 
That was actually good advice. 
From now on,i shall call us the problem solvers. 
Yo,ken.  Do you have a 
problem that needs solving? 
Actually,i do. 
Mr.  Baker wants to do 
everything for himself. 
I feel about as useless as a mom's college degree. 
Sounds like a job for the problem solvers. 
We'll talk to danny for you. 
Lemon,i was just going to call you. 
The guy who came up with this thing for arsenio hall wants to create a signature arm gesture for our talk show. 
I was thinking something like this. 
About the talk show... 
While i am very thankful for your offer, i think i maybe should take a couple other meetings before committing to anything. 
Like you said,i'm a commodity now. 
My book is number 14 on the nonfiction bestseller chart, right behind the founding fathers' diet. 
So...  I'm signing with an 
agent and exploring my options. 
I see. 
Well,if that's how you feel about it. 
Good luck in the marketplace. 
Obviously,this is nothing personal. 
I just want to be thorough. 
That's okay,right? 
All right,then.  Great meeting. 
Raise your hand if you're cool with what's happening. 
Not too late to raise your hand. 
Cerie,if you need me,i'll be at a meeting with my new agent. 
Oh,he called to confirm your lunch, but i told him you'd already eaten a weird panini. 
That was no. 
Just,heh,call him and tell him i'm on my way. 
 Do i look okay?  
 That's exactly how you look. 
There she is! The 
dealbreaker! Simon barrons. 
 You're an agent?  
 Uh,junior agent. 
Um,uh,full disclosure: until now,i've mainly represented dogs, but seeing as how we're both embarking on a new phase in our career performing, representing humans and monkeys i want you to know that i'm hungry. 
And i would do anything for you. 
My clients are more important to me than my own mommy. 
Okay,good.  I need someone 
that i can count on. 
I'm...  Kind of alone out 
here in the marketplace. 
I get it,i get it.  
That's what i'm here for. 
Um,okay,let's get your face out there,take some meetings. 
There's jack donahee at nbc. 
Donaghy.  Already met.  Who else? 
Do you know who scottie shofar is? 
Oh,yeah,he's the guy that produces   THAT DUMB SPORTS SHOW THAT ALWAYS BEATS US. 
Yeah,you're talking about sports shouting. 
 Okay,let's meet with him.  
 Absolutely. 
Now,i don't know him, but a former client of mine once buried a bone in his backyard. 
We go looking for that bone, it's like,"oh,mr.Shofar,what's up? 
My client has got an idea for a talk show. 
" oh,no,i got the hiccups. 
Danny,around here,we're known as the problem solvers. 
Always have been,always will be. 
And we think you could use a little guidance. 
Yes,please. 
I don't even know where the bathrooms are around here. 
It's not about the room,danny. 
It's about the man. 
Any room you see around here with a door, you make it your bathroom. 
You're an actor now.  You're special. 
And taking advantage of kenneth is part of it. 
It's what he's here for. 
Look,i'm just trying to keep my head down and suppress my canadian accent. 
I'm not "aboot" to... 
 Aboot...  Abwah...  Out. 
Ah,all i'm saying is that i don't want to rub anyone the wrong way,even kenneth. 
Oh,don't worry.  Kenneth 
loves being our slave. 
He may say that,but trust me,it's not true. 
I was an assistant once ,and when you're in that position you grow resentful and bitter. 
So what if kenneth's bitter?  He's an underhuman. 
Look,a couple days ago,i was working as a robot for spare change. 
And now look at me. 
Kenneth's a page,but who knows? 
Someday,he could be running the network. 
What?  That's ridiculous. 
 Crazier things have happened.  
 Kenneth in charge? 
Liz,here are today's press clippings. 
Women's health magazine gave us a dminus. 
Son of a bitch! 
Sheinhardtuniversal announces production of a dealbreakers talk show? 
What the what,jack? 
Let me explain something to you,lemon. 
Dealbreakers is a sketch that first appeared on this networkwe own it. 
And we're doing it whether or not you're involved. 
Really?  So you think 
you can just replace me? 
Of course not.  We can do better. 
I've already spoken to padma lakshmi. 
Then who's gonna host top chef? 
You are ruining my life! 
Well,we could just do the show with you. 
But that door is closing. 
Close it. 
You think you can bully me like this? 
Well,you don't know me. 
Two can play at this game,jack. 
Gaah! 
Ken,you don't want to be a page forever. 
Who said i've been alive forever? 
What?  No,i mean... 
 What's your dream job? 
Where do you see yourself in ten years? 
Well,you know how much i love television,sir. 
So i guess my dream would be to one day run the network. 
Just kidding.  There won't be a network. 
But whatever people are watching,i want to be in charge of it. 
So...  Someday,you could be my boss? 
Well,guess so. 
Now,are you ready to get started? 
No! I'll brush my own teeth. 
I don't want you to have any resentments towards me. 
From now on,i don't want you to do anything for me. 
Hey,jack. 
Two days to the show,and i still don't really know anything. 
I'll tell you everything you need to know,danny. 
Never do business with a friend. 
Never be friends with a woman. 
And lose the leather bracelet. 
Pete,i have a problem. 
 I need your help. 
Oh,my kid got hit by a car! 
Hey,jackie d,what's wrong? 
You're not your usual,giggly self. 
If you've got a problem,you've found the right people. 
Okay,i have a problem. 
It needs to be communicated to lemon that if she wants to play business, i'm more than happy to play with her. 
But as she saw earlier today,business jack does not play gentle. 
Are you as turned on as i am right now? 
Lemon has a decision to make.  
She can either be crushed by me. 
Or she can suck in her stomach and crawl back through the tiny crack i've left for her in the proverbial door. 
You think you can pass that along? 
Wait,hang on...  Our tshirts are wrong. 
Do you want to switch where we're standing,or switch our tshirts? 
Just to be safe,let's do both. 
Really?  He said crawl back? 
You're not really capturing the sexual energy of it, but that was the message. 
So problem solved? 
I haven't even begun to problem. 
We are suing jack donaghy and nbc for the rights to dealbreakers. 
Would either of you care for a drink? 
 No.  
 Do you have drinkable yogurt? 
Simon,we're both men of the world. 
Yeah,i've seen some bras. 
I bet you have. 
Here's the thing.  
No one's suing anyone. 
Don't let him push you around. 
I'm not.  God,leave me alone. 
Nbc employs 80% of your agency's clients, between are you stronger than a dog and i'm a celebrity dog: get me out arf here.  You need us. 
I've already talked to your lawyers,and they're not interested in pursuing this. 
God,jack,why are you being such a wang about this? 
I'll take that as a complement. 
An wang,the founder of wang computers, is one of the greatest businessmen of the 20th century. 
And you're the one being a lowercase wang,lemon, because after working with me every day for four years, you didn't trust me to produce your show. 
Instead,you made it about business. 
And i didn't get a bathroom door that looks like part of a wall by being bad at business. 
That's a bathroom? 
You tried to take advantage of our friendship to make money. 
I don't need you to make money. 
In fact,i'm meeting with your replacement tonight. 
Yeah?  Well,i'm replacing you too. 
Because i got all kinds of meetings lined up. 
 Big meetings.  
 Really?  With who? 
Damn it,simon! 
You were right about jack. 
He's in love with me? 
What?  No.  He burned 
me on dealbreakers. 
And now i need to find someone to help me burn him back. 
Well,i could introduce you to my boy,scottie shofar. 
You know him? 
Hell,yeah! I'm a frequent 
guest on sports shouting. 
Nah,introducing you to scottie probably wouldn't solve your problems with jack. 
Jack who?  Set it up. 
Scottie shofar.  I know that name. 
 What does he look like?  
 I don't know. 
All white people look the same to me,pete. 
Oh,my god. 
Scottie shofar was my assistant on trivial pursuit: the movie. 
I was horrible to him. 
And now he's actually successful? 
What if i got called in to audition for him and he recognized me, even with all the changes to my face? 
That have happened naturally. 
That's what danny was saying. 
We have to be cool to everybody. 
Because the future is like a japanese game show you have no idea what's going on. 
Miss maroney,your mexican diet pills came. 
Should i start taking them to test their side effects? 
No,kenneth.  I'll do it myself. 
You don't have to do anything for me anymore.  Ever. 
What is happening around here? 
What has changed? 
We're aboot to get married. 
Oh,no,that's not right.  Abhah.  Obot. 
Mr.  Baker.  We need to talk. 
Now's not a great time,kenneth. 
 I don't need anything. 
Sir,this time,i need something from you. 
You've poisoned mr.  Jordan's 
and miss maroney's minds. 
You've got to tell them to go back to the way it was. 
To let me help everyone again.  Including you. 
 Kenneth,i don't.  
 yes,you do. 
Because you're scared.  And frustrated. 
Of course i am,because i'm going on tv tomorrow and i don't know what i'm doing. 
 Embrace your anger.  
 What? 
Yyou know,of all the weirdos i've met around here, you're the worst! With 
your creepy,don knotts face, that ridiculous hitler youth haircut. 
Excellent.  What about my chin? 
What about your chin,kenneth? 
I've seen bigger chins on a premature baby! 
MR.Baker,you've just 
made me feel terrible. 
And said the word "about" correctly. 
Congratulations.  You're an actor. 
 About.  
 About. 
Oh,my god.  Thank you,kenneth. 
That was aboot the coolest thing i've ever seen. 
How long have you been there? 
 Nine hours.  
 A few minutes. 
Well,you need to know something too. 
No matter what happens in the future, i will always take care of you. 
Kenneth's the best. 
He knows what i want before i do. 
 Who's hungry?  
 I wanted waffles. 
So you can have all the powers of superman for an entire year,but superman? I've done hot yoga 
with tom welling and dean cain, and i don't think they're right for this. 
No,i wasn't,um sorry,i gotta take this. 
What's up?  Nothin',just meeting 
with this dealbreakers lady. 
I don't know.  
Regular,six.  Drunk,seven. 
Padma,i'm so happy you've taken an interest in dealbreakers. 
I love doing top chef, but this would give me a chance to showcase my other talents. 
I mean,men always tell me i'm very funny. 
Have you heard this one?  Knockknock. 
We don't even care about the profits from your actual show. 
That's nothing to us.  
That's our snapple money. 
See,we're all about monetizing you as a brand. 
I'm blowing up.  It's rahm emanuel. 
He wants me to go to deer valley.  I am crushing it! 
Yeah,because i'm really looking for a partner in this. 
Someone i can trust. 
So...  I would be a full 
partner in this with you? 
That's what i'm looking for,yes. 
I like it.  You know,i'm 
very entrepreneurial. 
I invented this new bag that you put around a sandwich to keep it fresh. 
But it's clear,so you still get the full visual of the sandwich. 
So it's a sandwich bag? 
No,jack,it's a new thing that i invented. 
The point is,we do business together, and you are my number one priority. 
Nothing is more important to me than you. 
I gotta take this.  It's brooke hogan. 
What's up,you tall drink of bitch! You're amazing. 
No,seriously.  Amazing. 
Yeah,you heard me.  Yeah,that's right. 
Yeah.  No,seriously. 
So what would my time commitment be if i host this thing? 
Honestly,two days a week. 
Wow,that's great. 
Top chef has all this traveling and allday shoots. 
If i could do this instead,i wouldn't be so grouchy and exhausted all the time. 
My clothes wouldn't have food stains all over them. 
I could actually find a balance between my work and being a mommy. 
This would change my life,jack. 
It would.  It would change your life. 
 So let's do this.  
 No. 
 What?  
 I don't want to change your life. 
I want to change lemon's life.  I'm sorry. 
Uhh,this business is so hard! 
Not really.I'm kidding. 
Go.  Go. 
 Lemon.  
 Jack. 
I was wrong.  It's you. 
 It's always been you. 
I want to do business with you,lemon. 
I'd like that.

ProudlyPresents do you have a problem? 
then call the problem solvers. 
Taxes got you down?  
Wasps in your crawlspace? 
Term paper blues?  Migrating implants? 
call the problem solvers. 
'Cause after all,what's a problem but an opportunity disguisedas a stripper having a seizure on your boat? 
Mouse in your house? 
Or need a cheap flight to tucson? 
Both: ?we are the problem...??solvers ? 
that was a good rehearsal. 
 Now let's record it. 
And we're rolling. 
Hey. 
Could I get your lucretia mott on this? 
What is this? 
Budget approval for travel and hotels for the moms. 
The moms? 
What moms? 
The staff moms that are gonna be on the mother's day show that nbc is making us do after their ill-fated decision to re-air the pilot of bitch hunter. 
Put the mimosas down! 
Bitch. 
Wait, it's mother's day already? 
Did you forget? 
Colleen is gonna kill you. 
There's still time. 
Jonathan. 
Jonathan, call the florist, and order a dozen--no. 
Necktie. 
Too late, Jackie. 
 30 Rock 4x20  
The Moms Hey, why isn't my beautiful Frank up on the wall? 
Ma, come on, that's just for the actors. 
Oh, here's a picture you can use. 
It's little Frankie in the bathtub, getting ready for the senior prom. 
Thank you. 
Mom, what are you doing? 
You don't have to pay for the food. 
Honey, nothing is free. 
You remember that when a man buys you an expensive meal. 
Yeah, that's happening a lot. 
Hey, verna. 
Well, you must remember my mom, Margaret. 
Oh, yes, we met a few years ago when the girls lived in Chicago. 
You must have me confused with someone else. 
I have never been to Chicago. 
I sexually assaulted scottie pippen in 1997. 
There's my baby! 
Oh, mommy! 
Look, Tracy, this mother's day show is tomorrow, and we haven't been able to track down your mom. 
I gave Kenneth her information. 
"Her name might be Cheryl, and she was wearing a red shirt in 1984." 
Look, I don't want you to be alone up there with all the families, so what if I hire an actress to play your mom? 
Okay. 
But whoever she is needs to be someone as amazing as I am. 
I want to see a list of names. 
Like when they was looking for John mccain's running mate. 
I'm kidding. 
This needs to be taken seriously. 
Happy mother's day, Colleen. 
I'm not here about mother's day, John Francis. 
You know who's in my water aerobics class down in Florida? 
Yes, mother, I've memorized the names of everyone in your water aerobics class. 
Patricia goodband, whose sister runs the Friday night bingo game at our lady of reluctant integration in waltham. 
Turns out last week that the game was won by Anne o'connor, who mentioned that her niece, Nancy Donovan, got divorced and was running around with a hotshot in New York City who pours scotch like a woman. 
If I don't always share my personal life with you, Colleen, it's becse you've never approved of any woman I've shown an interest in. 
Now, that's not true. 
I'm not having this conversation with you right now. 
I have work to do, and I'll be joining you for lunch. 
In the meantime, Kenneth here will entertain you. 
Okay, Kenneth, entertain me. 
 Oh, the fiddle's in the creek   and the frog's in the kitchen  I apologize, ma'am. 
That is not a song. 
You make me very nervous. 
Oh, my God. 
Hey, lutz, this is my mom, miho. 
Oh, hi. 
I didn't know you were adopted. 
What? 
Thanks a lot, lutz. 
Mom, this is Lee. 
He's the head of our wardrobe department. 
Well, hello, Lee. 
Wrong tree, mom. 
Gotcha. 
So Lee's gonna take care of your clothes for the show. 
Oh, no, no, that won't be necessary. 
I brought some real cute duds. 
I made us both rompers to wear. 
Excuse me. 
My...Friend has to go 
strangle her anxiety pillow. 
Lee, it's the bridesmaid's dress. 
I can't breathe. 
I'm gonna die in here. 
Bridesmaid? 
It's bad luck for a married woman to be a bridesmaid. 
It brings fever and disease. 
Yeah, well, I'm not actually married, so... 
Not even common law? 
How do you get credit at a mattress store? 
You know, my Johnny's single, and he gives excellent backrubs, I can assure you. 
Thank you, Mrs. lutz, 
and thank you, moms, for your interest, but I just haven't met the one yet. 
Oh, for crying out loud, Liz. 
You see? 
That's what feminism does. 
It makes smart girls with nice birthing shapes believe in fairytales. 
Stop waiting for your prince, Liz. 
I'm not waiting for a prince. 
I'm waiting for astronaut Mike Dexter. 
Oh, sweet lord in heaven. 
Who turns out to be the secret king of Monaco. 
Liz, you're almost 40. 
You're not gonna find some new kind of man. 
Whoever the one is, you probably already met him. 
You're 40? 
John is looking for a... 
Greener banana, so... 
Hello, verna. 
Glad to see you're here, upholding your end of our bargain. 
Oh, yeah. 
I'm being a great mother listening, giving advice, asking stupid questions during movies. 
But I need you to hold up your end. 
That money order you sent, that was only for half. 
That was a down payment, verna. 
You'll get the rest after you've fulfilled your mother's day duties. 
That's kind of a problem for me, 'cause I already spent that down payment on the first half of my boob job. 
It's not an implant. 
It's just a little yank up, you know? 
I mean, I got the meat, Jack. 
Go ahead. Feel 'em. 
Feel the difference. 
Very different indeed. 
Like a cantaloupe and a ziploc bag of mushroom soup. 
But you're not getting the rest of that money until you give Jenna all the mother's day love she deserves. 
Whatever. 
Narc. 
Good news, tray. 
We found a great mom for you. 
Her name is novella Nelson. 
Novella Nelson? 
Oh, wait, is she aquaman's girlfriend? 
No. She's a great actress 
who lives in Brooklyn. 
She looks like you. 
That could be anyone! 
We all look the same to me. 
Is she famous? 
You'd probably know her best from a commercial they air a lot during the 3:30 A.M. 
sportscenter. 
Ugh, these overalls are chafing. 
I can't wear these pajamas fishing! 
Female announcer: Pajamaralls. 
Pajamaralways. 
What about the list I gave you? 
Phylicia rashad. 
Serena Williams. 
They're too recognizable, Tracy. 
And Serena Williams is younger than you. 
Who cares? 
She's awesome, and so am I. 
I want Serena Williams to be my mother. 
We've already booked novella. 
The woman's been in the business for 40 years. 
I think she's good enough for the star of sherlock homie. 
I know what you're thinking, mother, and we are not talking about Nancy Donovan. 
I don't want to talk about Nancy Donovan. 
I want to talk about the little blonde girl that you are sleeping with. 
What? 
A mother knows, Jackie. 
Oh, hi. 
Are you going up? 
Down, actually. 
Ugh, I forgot my phone. 
Two women, Jack, at the same time. 
What are you, Italian? 
I didn't choose for it to happen like this. 
Be a man and pick one. 
I can't. They both 
give me different things. 
One connects me to the man I was. 
The other... 
Inspires. 
Just listen to yourself, Jack. 
I know it's gay, but it's my gay problem, and I'm handling it. 
We're ready to order now. 
Just bring my son one of everything. 
That way, he doesn't have to choose. 
Hey. 
Um, why was I given this to wear on the show? 
Well, I loved your idea that we both wear the same outfit. 
I just thought this one might be more...Tv friendly. 
You mean instead of the rompers that your mother slaved over. 
Mom, this isn't Florida. 
You're damn right it isn't. 
In Florida, everybody's always asking me, "where did you get that? 
You made it? 
Holy crap! 
Where do I commission one?" 
Oh. This is about you 
making money selling junk. 
Verna, this is my job, and I know you don't understand that, 'cause you haven't had a job in 15 years. 
Because of my back. 
Because of the trampoline accident. 
But I need to look a certain way on tv. 
You are nothing but a spoiled brat. 
You know what? 
Here's what I think of you and your fancy clothes. 
That is quality stitching. 
Damn the tiny, brown hands that made this. 
Oh, there you are. 
Just thought I'd tidy up. 
That's my computer. 
Oh, no, honey. 
A computer is a great big thing with a green screen. 
Mom, do you think it's weird that I'm still single? 
Well, your standards are very high. 
As they should be. 
I remember someone who got a three on her history ap test. 
But do I expect too much? 
Maybe the moms were right. 
Maybe I should have just settled. 
I can't tell you what to do, Liz, but I know from experience that that gu that perfect guy, is out there. 
'Cause I know I found mine. 
See, that's all I want. 
What you and dad have. 
Oh, I'm not talking about your father. 
What? 
what do you mean you're not talking about dad? 
You love dad. 
Of course I do, but Dick lemon isn't ed. 
Ed? Who's ed? 
Ed was my true love, sweetheart. 
He was my steady at montclair high. 
The night before he was shipped off to Korea, I repeatedly lost my virginity to him, while Waldo, the town perv, watched from the bushes. 
Wait, what? 
Nothing, younger me. 
It's fine. 
He wanted to get married, but when he was invited to Houston for his astronaut training he was an astronaut? 
You could have been an astronaut's wife? 
It wasn't that simple, Liz. 
I had just graduated from secretary school, and I got a job at sterling Cooper. 
I couldn't just pick up and move. 
I was already 26, an old maid. 
Different times. 
Octomom. 
So I settled for a wonderful man, and I have never regretted it. 
Not even when I watched ed aldrin walk on the moon. 
Wait, your ed is buzz aldrin? 
Yeah, but I always called him ed, because our town had, like, five buzzes. 
You could have married buzz aldrin? 
You should regret that, mom. 
You should have followed him. 
Laura linney could have played you in the hbo original movie moon wives! 
Where are you going, verna? 
Oh, I quit. 
I've been working my ass off pretending to be a good mom, but Jenna doesn't appreciate it. 
I see. 
Well, then good luck paying for that other implant. 
It's not an implant, Jack. 
I mean, I got the meat. 
Of course. 
I apologize. 
Verna, you have a very simple decision to make quit, don't get paid, and drive around with one headlight out, or, swallow your pride, and get the money you need tomorrow. 
They said they were gonna put a wig on me or something so that nobody would recognize me as the pajamarall lady. 
Like anyone would recognize you anyway. 
I'm sorry. 
What did you say? 
You are way beneath me, novella. 
I am a movie star, a television actor, and a guinness book of world record holder for most car accidents in a single year. 
Maybe you wanted someone more high-profile, but I am what you got, so, Tracy, you better watch yourself, or you may wind up with no mother at all. 
Fine. I'd rather be 
up on that stage all alone than to be with someone whose resume has "black judge" on it nine times. 
And you think I wanted a fake son who recorded an anti-condom psa? 
I saved a lot of kids from lame sex! 
Little ingrate. 
All right, start with taxes, then insurance, and change this to "latin America." 
I can't say Nicaragua. 
Gah! 
You must be Avery. 
Yes? 
I am so sorry, miss Jessup. 
Mrs. Donaghy keeps tricking me 
and running away, but not anymore. 
Carl, they need you out in the hall. 
Yes, ma'am! 
Mrs. Donaghy. 
You must be Jack's mother. 
Indeed, I am. 
And Jack has told me so much about you. 
You're going to have to work your backside, because chest-wise you have the measurements of an altar boy. 
I wish Jack had told me you were in town. 
Well, men have their little secrets, don't they? 
Especially Jack. 
Secrets? 
What I'm trying to say is, if you're serious about Jackie, let him know now. 
A man like Jack has other irons in the fire. 
I beg your pardon? 
Oh! 
Look at the time. 
I've got to get back to calling Kenneth "carl" to see if he ever corrects me. 
Carl! 
Yes, ma'am? 
Lemon, have you seen Colleen? 
Kenneth was supposed to be watching her, but I just saw him with his eyes closed counting to infinity. 
You want to talk about moms, Jack? 
Listen to this. 
My mother could have married buzz aldrin. 
Oh, really? 
I know buzz. 
We met at a photo shoot for vanity fair's annual awesome gentleman issue. 
My mom blew it, Jack. 
She had true love, and she threw it away just because it was inconvenient. 
Well, lemon, if your mom had ended up with buzz, you would have never been born. 
Or I would have been born Peter aldrin. 
And I+d wait for a woman with the right stuff. 
Now, remember, in this scenario, I'm a man and my father is an astronaut. 
Well, lemon, if you'd like to see what your mom's life would have been, I can arrange for you to meet buzz. 
Are you serious? 
He's in town. 
I saw him last night at Rupert Murdoch's twister party. 
I mean, uh, regular party. 
Tracy, this mother's day thing is a disaster. 
I hear you. 
Because you're talking in the ear that I didn't lose a button in. 
I thought verna and I had made this breakthrough, but now we're just back to fighting about money and clothes. 
Thank God Terry's dead, or we'd be fighting over him again too. 
Boy, I thought I had it bad with my fake mom. 
Are you kidding? 
At least your fake mom has to act like she cares about you. 
Yeah, it's true. 
And she is a good actress. 
I bought those pajamaralls. 
And you got to choose her. 
No, Jenna, no one gets to choose their mom... 
Even when they're fake. 
For good or bad, we're stuck with them. 
And you know what? 
They don't get to choose who we are, either. 
And God knows we're not perfect. 
It's true. 
Sometimes I sing too beautifully. 
What a nice surpri is there another woman? 
What? How did you--? 
Colleen. 
Don't blame your mother, Jack. 
This is about us. 
Oh, my God. Look, Avery, 
you know how I feel. 
So I'm gonna skip the part where I deny anything. 
Then you skip the part where you yell at me. 
And then we both move on to the, uh, make-up sex. 
Wow. 
That is a swing. 
Look, I assumed you and I were exclusive, but we never talked about it, so maybe this is partly my fault. 
And I forgive you. 
Come here. 
I'm sorry. 
But these tactics have worked on stupider women. 
If we're going to move forward, you better figure out what it is you want. 
Soon. 
Excuse me, Dr. aldrin. 
I'm sorry. There wasn't a door, 
so I just... 
I don't believe in barriers, because I always break them. 
You must be Liz. 
Yes, sir. 
I actually came about my mother, Margaret lemon. 
Well, you would have known her as Margaret Freeman. 
Maggie Freeman? 
Of course I remember her. 
Well, I'm sorry to bother you, but I can't help but wonder what my mom lost by giving up on you, her perfect man. 
Perfect? Sure, 
I'm a famous astronaut, decorated fighter pilot, doctorate from mit, but even I sometimes... 
I see you. 
I see what you're doing. 
Return to the night. 
You've no business here. 
Are you yelling at the moon? 
I'm sorry. 
She and I just... 
I get mad sometimes. 
Sure. 
Look, you want to know what your mother missed? 
Years of drinking, depression, cheating. 
I flipped over a saab in the San Fernando valley. 
I once woke up in the air and space museum with a revolver in the waistband of my Jean shorts. 
Oh, my God. 
But you're a human being. 
But I'm at peace now. 
Sober almost 32 years. 
But I would have put Maggie Freeman through hell. 
The moms were right. 
There's no such thing as astronaut Mike Dexter. 
What am I doing? 
I'm sorry if I've disappointed you. 
Would you like to yell at the moon with buzz aldrin? 
Yes, please. 
I own you! 
You dumb moon! 
I walked on your face! 
Don't you know it's day? 
Idiot! 
Well, I'm ready for the show. 
Mom, you're wearing my outfit. 
Well, a mother makes sacrifices. 
Like those 16 hours I spent in labor, even though it was Margarita Monday at dockside Joe's. 
Daughters make sacrifices too. 
Why are you wearing that? 
Who's paying you? 
No one. 
I'm wearing it for the same reason you're wearing mine. 
Because I love you. 
I love you too, baby girl. 
Oh. 
Why does your chest feel weird? 
Uh, because I love you so much. 
 Sincerely   oh yes sincerely   'cause I love you so dearly  you look beautiful... 
Mom. 
Thank you. 
Son. 
I think I'm ready for the sex talk. 
 Oh you know how I love you  mom, you were right to settle. 
I'm glad you married dad. 
So am I, dear. 
Now, would you please find yourself someone and start a family before my hereditary dementia sets in? 
Wait, what? 
 Please say   you'll be mine  you. 
What is wrong with you? 
I am 51 years old. 
Do you not think I can take care of my own personal life? 
Think? 
I know you can't. 
You do a lot of things well make money, choose wine, wear ties. 
But you and women? 
Disaster. 
Divorce. 
Broken engagements. 
I assume herpes. 
And I wonder why I'm like that. 
Maybe it's because you can't let go of your precious Jackie, so you undermine me at every turn. 
I'm not gonna be around forever. 
Don't pull that out, Colleen. 
And if I don't do something, you will never make a decision. 
You'll just froufrou around with Nancy and Avery until they're both gone. 
And then where will I be? 
I'll be circling the globe in my coffin rocket. 
Something I saw on tv. 
It's very expensive. 
I'm done disapproving, Jackie. 
I'm just trying to help. 
I need to know that someone is looking out for my little boy. 
All right, Colleen. 
Then I'm asking you, for the first time in my life, tell me what to do. 
And I'm going to tell you, for the first time in my life, I can't! 
I--I did not lose her, sir. 
Carl would never let you down. 
Carl, that does not sound right. 
Kevin--no. 
Who am I? 
Is it Keith? 
No, that's not yes, I'm Keith. 
That's our show. 
Thanks for watching. 
But before you go to bed, our moms are gonna tuck you in with a special song. 
 Don't go to sleep with a frown in your pocket   take it to the yard and tie it to a rocket   shoot it to the moon   you'll feel better soon   don't go to bed with a frown  all: ♪ don't go to bed with a frown  good night. 
Lemon. 
I just got my bridesmaid's dress For cerie's wedding. 
It is a vietnamese size two. 
Dressing up isn't any easier for men. 
Do you know what it's like when a younger man shows up Wearing the same cufflinks? 
You might as well be invisible. 
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna let this dress win. 
I have a plan. 
This morning, I joined  A suicide cult! 
 A gym. 
What do you want, jack? 
I just received a call from don geiss' Estate lawyer. 
Apparently, I've been named in his will. 
I know this is a difficult time for you, But word of advice: If the will says that you have to spend the night In a haunted house, you better hope That everybody else there is black guys and sluts. 
I just want something to remember the man by. 
 Okay. 
 His pen or his tie clip. 
Maybe that boyhood sled he held so dear. 
I believed he called it... 
Sleddy. 
Something which I, in turn, Can then pass on to my... 
Protege. 
any chance it's one of those Bendy hospital beds? 
Maybe. He did have three. 
he was such an amazing man. 
Before we rehearse, I have an announcement to make. 
Our boy grizz is getting married on may 22nd. 
Jeez, another wedding. 
Life is like tv. 
Testing tells us that people like weddings, births, And episodes where a character dies. 
That's dumb. 
My heart! 
So I thought grizz might want to take this time To announce who's gonna be his best man. 
Um...I haven't decided yet. 
"um, I haven't decided yet." 
You sound like my mother Talking to the planned parenthood lady. 
Seriously, which one of your rich and famous friends With hepatitis b are you going to pick? 
Let's not do this in front of everybody. 
Let's not do this in front of everybody? 
You sound like my mother being pulled onstage At a 2 live crew concert. 
Damn. 
My mother had problems. 
Oh, brother, we have to tell jenna We can't do her kardashian sketch Because jack is "bros" with lamar odom. 
you are such a coward! 
you think I care what you think? 
Hey, jenna! 
So look, we can't do the kardashian sketch. 
Okay, I understand. 
Pete, there you are you. 
I heard one of your kids broke his arm. 
Oh, uh, yeah. 
The shed I built collapsed on him. 
Well, is he gonna be okay? 
What's going on? 
Why are you being so happy and nice? 
Are you soaking your tampo in vodka again? 
Because the glue is abrasive. 
But I'm really happy. 
Is there any chance This might make our lives easier? 
No way. I have seen 
this 100 times. 
She gets psyched about some guy, He reveals himself to be crazy, Then there's a terrible breakup, And we suffer. 
Remember when she dated that sniper? 
And so it's over. 
Jenna, there's a laser sight on your forehead. 
Oh, please. He's not gonna fire. 
For god's sakes, he's scared of his own mother! 
Aren't cha, alan? 
Aah! 
Whoever this new guy is, We need to figure out his deal Before she gets burned and takes it out on us. 
Tell me about it. 
Remember this breakup, when she bit me? 
Pete, that was, like, two years ago. 
It just won't heal. 
That concludes mr. 
Geiss' financial disbursements. 
I believe all have been accounted for. 
His daughter. His lovely wife. 
His even lovelier mistress. 
The secret canadian family. 
And his even more secret attic family. 
L that remains are a few personal items. 
"to my daughter cathy, "I bequeath my pocket watch. 
"it comes with very specific instructions for care, "the most important of which Is to not let the piece get wet." 
"to my protege and friend, john francis donaghy, "I leave a gift "from the gardens of my estate in connecticut. 
My beloved pet peacock, argus." 
Hello, old friend. 
Ugh! Vietnamese size two. 
Beth, I hope it wasn't awkward for you When tracy brought up my wedding. 
Why would it be awkward? 
Because of our sexual past. 
Leave it open. I'd feel safer. 
How could I help you, grizz? 
Well, tracy keeps pushing... 
To be your best man. 
Yeah, I noticed that. 
But I wanna pick dotcom and... 
And you're afraid that tracy will freak out. 
So you want me to help you convince him to step aside. 
You know my every thought, beth. 
We really were the sam and diane of this place. 
no. 
Liz, pete, I want you to meet someone. 
This is my boyfriend paul. 
 Pete hornberger. 
 Hey. 
But you can call me dallas. 
this could be the start of something for me. 
It's really nice to meet you, And I'm a big fan of the show. 
Yeah, so, paul, what's your deal? 
How did you guys meet? 
Through a mutual fund. 
Friend, jenna. 
Oh, of course. 
Through a friend fund. 
Noted. 
And what do you do for a living, paul? 
Oh, I work for a bank. 
...Rupt circus. 
He works for a bankrupt circus. 
Okay, he's hiding something. 
I'm guessing... 
Already-married cat strangler. 
Hmm. 
Hey, could I just get a signa Agh! Living dinosaur! 
Lemon. 
This is argus. 
He was a gift from don geiss. 
Don's last gift, to be exact. 
Why did don geiss have a peacock? 
Is that an nbc thing? 
No, don owned argus long before he bought nbc. 
Peacocks can live up to 40 years, Longer if they're not part of mike tyson's home zoo. 
Ohh, what a weird gift. 
Not at all. 
When don was first taking me under his wing, He and I would sit on the veranda Of his home in connecticut, Talking about business, politics, How to avoid getting paper cuts while making love On a pile of money. 
And our friend argus would strut proudly through the garden. 
We three peacocks felt like we owned the world. 
Well, that's a how did he get up here so quick? 
You know, I never told anybody this before, lemon, But don and I had nicknames for each other. 
Like we might someday, j-town? 
We called each other sempai and kohai. 
Master and pupil. 
Terms we learned on a trip to japan Because they played the movie rising sun on the airplane. 
Don was my sempai. 
Now this bird is... 
All that remains. 
Jack, I'm really sorry for your Oh, his feather went in my mouth. 
Ew, it's so oily. 
Lemon, he's marked you. 
He thinks you're his wife. 
Go! Get out. 
yah! 
Hey, tracy. 
Grizz and I were just talking. 
Of course. 
You guys are very close. 
Continue. 
And we had an amazing idea. 
We thought that maybe, at the wedding, You could be the lead singer of the band. 
Really? I'd be awesome at that. 
You would. 
Now, of course you couldn't sing and But who's gonna tell you two? 
The wedding band is u2? 
No! You two idiots! 
I see what you're trying to do. 
You're trying to manipulate me Into not being the best man. 
And, damn it, grizz, I've known you since you was six feet tall! 
I'm gonna be your best man! 
I am the leader of this entourage! 
and because of you, I'm having a tantrum! 
Now pick up that table and smash it for me! 
That's right! 
I know that. 
Hey, jenna... 
What are you doing? 
I'm just feeling the weight Of jenna's jewelry on my finger pads. 
pete! 
Pete! 
Ugh. Dallas. - What's up? 
Paul is getting weirder. 
We've got to step it up. 
You know what we should do, we should follow him. 
I don't care how long it takes. 
What's going on? 
Your kids have a play tonight? 
Oklahoma. 
They couldn't find cowboy hats big enough For my kid's head, So they're just wearing turbans. 
It's on. When paul leaves, 
we follow him, Cia style. 
And afterwards, I go to the gym. 
Words are the first step on the road to deeds! 
You wanted to see me, sir? 
Oh, my, what a gorgeous swamp eagle. 
This is argus. 
He is very special to me. 
 Is he okay? 
 I don't know. 
He's become listless. 
And he won't eat any of the peacock food I got at the crazy rich person's pet store. 
Frankly, I don't know what to do. 
He's recently taken a mate. 
Lemon. 
Good luck, argus. 
Well, sir, there's nothing wrong with this bird. 
He's just very old. 
Argus probably doesn't have very long to live. 
All of your page duties stop right now. 
The welfare of this bird is your only concern. 
He lives...Or you die. 
I was about to suggest the same thing. 
Hey, dummy, What are you doing to grizz? 
Whoa, you watch your mouth, Before I show you the back of my hand. 
Look, you gotta grow up about this best man thing. 
Liz lemon, I don't even want to be best man. 
Why would I? 
Show up one time, not lose a ring, Keep my shirt on through a dinner? Psh. 
Then why are you throwing a fit about it? 
Because I'm trying to protect dotcom, dummy. 
He's in love with grizz's fiancee... 
Feyonce! 
Oh, your stutter is back. 
No, grizz's fiancee's name is feyonce. 
Like beyonce with an "f." 
 Ah, come on. 
 Listen... 
We cannot make dotcom Get up there and give a speech at that wedding. 
It'd kill him! 
Wow, I can't believe that you are using Your infantile selfishness for good. 
I'm impressed, tracy. 
You think that's impressive, Watch me stand on one foot. 
Hang on. I did it earlier. 
You're right, tracy. 
You've got to convince grizz to choose you. 
No, you do. 
Why do I have to do everything? 
Oh! I am never gonna 
fit in that dress. 
Bored! 
What? Ohh. 
That's a bar. 
We're gonna have to drink a lot to fit in. 
I don't understand where he went. 
Can I get five more beers here? 
Name's dallas. 
I don't get it. Did we lose him? 
What if he's in a secret back room doing pot? 
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together For miss jinah baloney! 
what did he say? 
Is that jenna? 
No, it's paul. 
* my muffin top is all that * * whole grain, low fat * * I know you want a piece of that * * but I just want to dance * I'm jenna. Naturally. 
Jenna's boyfriend is a jenna maroney impersonator. 
* * Work it, miss thang. 
Oh, god. 
I'm gonna need five more cranberry juices over here! 
Jack, I just found out that jenna Is dating a guy who does a drag show...As her. 
Lemon, what is with this food layout? 
Kenneth says he needs some sumac bark And shrub yellow root To make a poultice for argus. 
How is your thing weirder than mine? 
I... 
I am not letting that bird die. 
And why does he have to? 
For god's sakes, if we can put an ear On a mouse's back, We can certainly make a peacock immortal. 
Oh, jack, I know this is important to you, But it is just a bird. 
I mean, do you think maybe you're so worked up about argus Because you never let yourself grieve for don? 
I did grieve for don. 
As soon as jack welch told me, I went through all five stages of grief. 
Don is dead. 
What? 
You didn't do anything. 
 Let me retell it  in slow motion. 
Don is dead. 
* * See? 
Sir, I just wanted to let you know, Argus is sleeping. 
And you left him alone? 
What if he rolls over on his back And his cloaca fills with mucous? 
Oh, brother. This is 
not about some peacock. 
We're gonna have to help him, kenneth. 
I have an idea, but you're gonna have to take the lead, Because I am stretched pretty thin. 
Well, not new york thin, but Don't worry, I'm on it, ms. Lemon. 
Sorry--mrs. Argus. 
Okay. 
Beth, I need you to do something for me. 
Yeah, actually, I need to talk to you About the wedding. 
I'm too upset to talk. 
Look at me. 
What's this? 
Grizz has asked me to read this to both of you. 
"dear friends, "I don't want any more fighting or bad feelings. 
"tracy, I love you, but I've known dotcom "ever since we went to above the beanstalk, "a free summer camp for giants. 
"I want him to be my best man. 
"and if you care about me, "you'll respect my decision. 
I will always be your" Oh, no, I'm white. 
I can't read that word. 
"friend from the neighborhood. 
Grizz." 
I'm so honored. 
Now no one is getting hurt. 
No one at all. 
Thanks, guys. 
I'm so happy. 
Hey! Jenna! 
So nice to meet paul! 
Interesting guy. 
How much do you know about him? 
Well, I lost a toe ring in him, So I'd say a lot. 
No, I mean, like, what he does... 
At night, and what he wears there And who he's being. 
So...You know about paul's act. 
Wait, you know about paul's act? 
How do you think we met? 
Paul won a jenna maroney impersonator contest, At which I came in fourth. 
And now you're dating him? 
That's it, right there. 
That face. 
That is exactly why I didn't tell you about paul in the first place. 
Your judgmental badger face. 
Jenna, even for you, This is weird. Be a friend, liz. 
Until then, I don't want to talk to you. 
Looks like one of us is in trouble. 
 How is he? 
 He's awake. But... 
But what? 
Well, sir, I've spent a lot of time with peafowl. 
They make all sorts of different noises. 
ooh, that's a car alarm. 
Kenneth, what's your point? 
It's just I've never in all my life Heard a peacock say Sempai and kohai. 
What did you say? 
Sempai and kohai. 
At least, that's what it sounded like. 
Kenneth, I've been under a lot of strain lately. 
But do you believe a human soul Could be transferred into an animal vessel? 
Sir, I think that there's a lot about this world That we don't understand. 
Like the afterlife. 
Or how bread turns into toast. 
Liz, I am in love with grizz's fiancee, feyonce. 
Oh, my god! 
I definitely didn't know that. 
Would you talk to grizz and convince him Tracy should be his best man? 
Okay, yeah. I'll try to help. 
But can I please go to the gym first? 
No. 
Hello. 
badger. 
It's another badger. 
The third badger has taken the bait. 
Why is everyone code named badger? 
I thought you said you wanted to do it this way. 
No, I said I didn't care. 
Jenna, can we please talk about this Before it becomes a big Aah! - Hello, liz. 
Jenna told me I didn't need to hide from you anymore. 
All right, let's cut to the chase. 
What's your game, friend? 
What are you getting out of this What am I getting out of this? 
Yeah. 
I am the luckiest "shman" in the world. 
I get to be with the most talented, Beautiful, sexy woman ever. 
So you aren't just using her for your act? 
My act? 
I'd never tuck my penis again if she asked me. 
All I want to do Is spend my days listening to her talk and sing And scream at her cleaning lady on the phone. 
To be honest, liz, I just don't understand what she gets out of it. 
I think I do, paul. 
She finally gets to love herself. 
It's perfect. 
What are you two talking about? 
You, jenna. 
Ooh. 
This situation is empirically weird. 
But...I'm glad you're happy. 
I heard what you said about me. 
You're so sweet. 
God, you're incredible. 
Okay, guys, let's just... 
Ew, jenna, why are you grabbing his boobs? 
I don't know, argus. 
Maybe it's the scotch talking, But I think... 
There might be a man's soul inside you. 
This is crazy, but, don, If you're in there... 
Give me a sign. 
You want a drink. 
Don... 
Sempai... 
There's just a few things I want you to know. 
You're the father that I never had. 
Just let me finish. 
I want to live the rest of my life In a way that'll make you proud. 
I just wish you could be here to watch me do it. 
Good-bye, sir. 
All right, grizz. 
I'm gonna speak frankly to you now. 
And I can do that because of our... 
Sexual past. 
Damn, beth, let it go. 
Don't even have a best man. 
Your wedding day Is about you and your bride. 
So who cares what anyone thinks? 
Love isn't judgmental. 
Love is patient. 
Love is...Weird. 
And sometimes gross. 
Love is elusive. 
And you found it. 
So treasure it. 
And maybe don't leave it alone with dotcom. 
That was beautiful. 
Look at me... 
Crying like a baby. 
So now I am grizz and feyonce's Woman of honor. 
And he wants me to give the same speech At the hunts point marriott while wearing a dashiki. 
So you're In three weddings in the same day, yeah. 
You're welcome. 
* when I was young * * I never needed anyone * * makin' love was just for fun * * those days are gone * * all by myself * * don't wanna be * * all by myself * * anymore * This is awesome! 
﻿1 Good morning, Lemon. 
Ugh. I hate January. 
It's dark and freezing, and everyone's wearing bulky coats. 
You can do some serious subway flirting before you realize the guy is homeless. 
Work is awful. 
Everyone's snippy and tense. 
Well, the lack of sun makes people depressed. 
It's called seasonal affective disorder. 
Oh, is that where the word "sad" comes from? 
What? 
You think "sad" is an acronym invented by psychologists? 
I've been stuck inside playing online boggle. 
It's messing with my head. 
Star, rats, arts, tars. 
It's from Nancy. 
She said she's in line behind the female Larry Bird. 
Oh, God. 
There's a photo. 
Oh, come on. 
How is female Larry Bird holding hands with a guy? 
What am I doing wrong? 
What's that for? 
I'm telling Nancy that I'm with female Kevin McHale. 
So what's going on with you and Nancy, anyway? 
We're just friends. 
It's platonic. 
I have elaborate fantasies of her husband dying in a boat explosion. 
But she's getting divorced, right? 
Well, she hasn't mentioned it. 
It's not the sort of thing you discuss by text or email. 
Well, this is my stop. 
Stop. Pots. 
Tops. Opts. Post. 
Morning, Kenneth. 
Good morning, Miss Lemon. 
I'm sorry. 
I didn't mean to snap at you. 
I've got winter madness. 
Lutz, do the right thing. 
What's going on? 
It's Lutz's turn to pick where we eat today. 
Oh, boy. 
Lutz, don't do this. 
It's my turn to pick. 
I'm the picker. 
Lutz, look at me. 
It's a long year. 
Think of the group. 
 Subway. 
 I hope you die! 
Are you out of your mind? 
Whoa, you guys. 
Calm down. 
I know we're all tired and cranky, but we just got to get to the end of the season. 
And, hey, who knows? 
Maybe some people won't be coming back next year. 
I don't care. 
Worth it. 
I hate the new guy. 
Loser. 
Season 4 Episode 11 Winter Madness Oh, hello. 
Hey, Jack. 
Go to the... 
Portant... 
Ing over the... 
Octopus. 
Nancy, I'm sorry. 
The audio's bad. 
Jonathan, why do I have an Indian assistant if my computer is always... 
Jack. 
I'm messing with you. 
Oh, very funny, Donna. 
The... 
Aw, the computer froze. 
Nice. 
So, uh... 
To what do I owe the pleasure? 
I wanted to tell you I'm coming down to New York. 
Oh, really? 
When? 
June 5th. 
For my son's graduation. 
So five months from now. 
Okay. 
Well, maybe you'll come up here before then? 
Well, my 25th reunion from Harvard Business School is... 
June 5th. 
That's too bad. 
Well, I should go. 
I got to scrape the icicles off the gutters. 
I'm tired of waking up to a porch full of dead squirrels. 
God, I miss Boston. 
See ya. 
Liz, I have an idea. 
Something to boost morale. 
Pete, no. 
I listened to you when you wanted to take the staff to see that "R" rated hypnotist, and that sucked. 
He was pretty bad. 
Nutmeg. 
Rodeo, rodeo, rodeo. 
Look, I think we can take the show to Miami for a week. 
What? 
Can we afford to do that? 
If we do it on the cheap, double up rooms. 
Think about it, Liz. 
Florida. 
I can rent a convertible, You can complain about the heat with elderly people. 
I can sell this to Jack. 
Cross promotional, Deal mechanics, Revenue streams, Jargon, Synergy. 
That's the best presentation I've ever seen. 
Get started right away. 
Whoo! 
One little thing. 
Instead of Miami, make it Boston. 
But I... I bought a parrot shirt. 
Whoo! Okay. 
Exciting news, guys. 
This week, TGS is going on the  road  There's a rumor that it's Miami. Is it Miami? 
Close. 
It is a city with an NBA team. 
And even though Will Smith never wrote any raps about it, the poet Robert Lowell lived there. 
Okay, we're going to Boston. 
No one's happy about it. 
Oh, it's freezing there. 
No, no, no, it's gonna be fun. 
How? 
Their bars close at 2:00. 
You know, I went to college in Boston. 
Well, not in Boston, but nearby. 
No, not tufts... 
Shut up. 
It's 14 degrees up there. 
How is that supposed to make us feel better? 
 Harvard. 
 You have been told to shut up. 
Come on. Silver lining. 
It's a fun vacation on the show's dime. 
FYI, to pay for this vacation, we need to cut some corners, so we sill be doubling up hotel rooms, and we are going by bus. 
By bus? 
Also, there is no Spectravision or Internet in the hotel, So plan ahead, gentlemen, porn-wise. 
Did Pete just say we're doubling up rooms? 
Did he? 
Oh, this is the worst. 
Well, what if, uh, you and I room together? 
Oh, no. Toofer and I 
already talked about it. 
You can't have talked about it! 
You just said you didn't even know about it. 
You think I like sharing a room with Toofer? 
Dude is still playing that Obama song. 
And yeah, I know you're standing there! 
Hey, fellas, we're getting Tracy his own room, So I assume you two will pair up? 
Why would you just assume we would room together? 
Why would he assume we wouldn't? 
I don't know. 
Maybe because one of us still hasn't read the other's screenplay. 
I read it. 
I just didn't like it. 
Hey, Cerie, I thought you and I could be roommates. 
Go out, meet guys, share clothes like twinsies. 
What size are you? 
Usually designers just make clothes for me, But when I do buy stuff, I'm a child's medium. 
Well, I only wear designer labels. 
These are Jamie Foxx for assfarm. 
But I can't room with you. 
Sue and I already talked about it. 
Why? You know sue says stuff 
about you behind your back. 
She always says stuff to me about you. 
Wait, what? 
I was making my thing up. 
You bitch! 
 What did you tell her, you vondruke? 
Liz Lemon, I can't go to Boston. 
Oh, Tracy, come on. 
You don't understand. 
I get in trouble on the road. 
Thank you, thank you. 
It's great to be here, Cleveland. 
You suck. 
I suck? 
The rock and roll hall of fame sucks! 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Hello. 
The road is a minefield, L.L. 
All those angry drunks and new temptations? 
Yeah, I don't know what to tell you. 
This Boston thing is Jack's idea. 
That stupid, Irish piece of...! 
Oh, boy. 
Boston is not gonna go well. 
 WBHD, Boston  Hey, leave him alone. 
Stop it. 
Miss Lemon. 
These gentlemen are the writers for Bruins Beat, Whose offices we'll be sharing. 
They are all named Sean. 
They are mean, and I hate it here. 
Liz, Mr. Donaghy would like 
to see you in his office... 
What? What? 
Boys, come on. 
Ow! Ow! 
Please! Please help! 
Please! Please! 
You've got to be kidding me. 
What, are you not using an office-replication service while we're here in Boston? 
Is it identical? 
Not quite. 
Seven items are different. 
See if you can spot which ones. 
So how's the show looking for Friday? 
Like it may not happen, actually. 
Oh, that'll really disappoint your key demographic of drunken 11-year-olds. 
Look, I know for you this is all just a way to meet married ladies, but it is my job. 
Let me give you some advice on uniting a dividing people... 
Find a common enemy. 
A common enemy? 
For example, What keeps people polite on airplanes? 
A shared hatred of the CBS sitcoms They're forced to watch. 
No, I understand the concept, Because with these dummies, The common enemy is always me. 
And I'm sick of it. 
I'm not gonna be the bad guy this time. 
Then find someone else. 
I recommend Lutz. 
Why do I always want to choke that guy? 
You just do. 
But that is not... 
Am I interrupting? 
Of course not. 
 Oh. 
 Oh. 
You're not a part of this, Liz. 
Why didn't you tell me you were coming up here? 
I wanted it to be a surprise. 
And I hope that you and of course Mark will come to the show on Friday. 
I can't believe I'm in the same building as Bruins Beat. 
 Come on. Give me a tour. 
 Of course. 
Ooh, actually I'm gonna tag along. 
I still haven't had a formal tour of the facility. 
So I'm gonna... 
Stay here. 
Why the long face? 
Your boss there making your life miserable? 
It's complicated, Sean. 
Yeah, I know what it's like. 
I'm the head writer at Bruins Beat. 
Trying to have it all... 
It's wicked hard. 
Is this where they do the news? 
It's small, isn't it? 
I find that news anchors and breasts are always smaller than they look on TV. 
You can try it. 
Feel like Chet Curtis and Natalie Jacobson. 
Tonight's top story, A Worcester man accused of trading his foster son for gasoline. 
And later in the hour, Ten tips on how to make your cat's birthday go purr-fectly. 
Back to you, Nat. 
Nancy, are you okay? 
Oh, God. 
I swore I wasn't gonna cry in front of you. 
Mark left. 
Yesterday. 
He took a job in New Orleans. 
What? 
What about his roofing company? 
Apparently Brad Pitt and Sharon Stone did a crap job rebuilding those Katrina homes, and Mark thinks he can make a fortune down there. 
But I know the real reason he left. 
He wants to force me to be the one to ask for the divorce. 
So you guys are having problems? 
I'm sorry. 
Oh, Jack, it's a mess. 
Suddenly he has his own bank account. 
We've had our house on the market for a year, and neither one of us know what to do about the dog, 'cause we both hate it. 
Have you talked openly about divorce? 
Yeah, we talked to Dr. Phil, 
and then we made a collage in our dream journals. 
No. 
You know how it is up here. 
People don't talk. 
They just run off to New Orleans And jump on that B.S. Saints bandwagon. 
Go pats. 
Oh, Donovan, I hate seeing you like this. 
Well, I... I got to get going. 
I... I got an open house tomorrow, 
and Mark was supposed to shovel the walk and salt the carport. 
I can barely understand you, but let me help while I'm here. 
Do you know how to rewire a doorbell? 
I do if you can resuscitate an electrocuted person. 
Can you wire the doorbell to the dog? 
Okay, that's lunch. 
Dude, why do you keep fixing my spelling? 
We're back in at 3:00. 
No, 3:30. 
Enjoy the town, everyone. 
You're welcome. 
Now who would like to join me on a morale-boosting tour of Boston's historic freedom trail? 
Ooh, I would... 
N't. 
Now what am I supposed to do? 
I got free time in a strange city. 
Why don't you come on the freedom trail with me? 
It's an educational walking tour. 
Purr-fect! 
Like a cat birthday. 
How could I possibly get in trouble on a walking tour? 
Smash-cut to... 
And I, John Hancock, With one stroke of my pen, set all Americans free. 
You lying, white devil! 
The only people you set free were rich, white dudes like yourself! 
I think my good friend and supervisor Paul Revere can address that. 
I'm out, Kenny. 
Hey, you know what? 
We're gonna go. 
Man, no. 
Most dudes that signed that declaration of independence owned slaves! 
What about you, John Hancock? 
Well, technically, I just inherited my slaves. 
I knew it. 
For a dude that has the most hilarious last name I ever heard, you blow. 
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock. 
Plymouth Rock landed on Mars! 
All right. 
Give it a try. 
'kay. 
Ugh. 
I have many other valuable skills. 
It'll be the new owner's problem. 
Just like the water heater. 
And the ghost. 
Well, it is a buyer's market right now. 
I think it'll turn around in the next year or so. 
Oh, I can't wait that long. 
I got to sell this place if I want to get divorced. 
What do you mean? 
Well, there's no money, Jack. 
If I can get some cash out of this place, Then I can start a new life. 
Buy a condo in Marina Bay. 
Open a store for redheaded girls to buy cosmetics... 
From someone who understands. 
So you need to sell this house to get divorced? 
Basically. 
You looking for a country estate in Waltham? 
There it is. See? 
Why did you even get to pick lunch again? 
Because it's my birthday. 
And thanks for remembering. 
I'm 45. 
It's kind of a big deal. 
Who orders food from a gas station? 
The Shell by me has good hot dogs. 
Guys, guys, come on. 
We're all in this together. 
Shut up, Liz. 
This is your fault. 
It's not my fault. 
I tried to do something nice. 
It was Jack... 
Sure, find a scapegoat. 
Just like John Hancock did with the good King George. 
Jack made us come to Boston. 
This isn't about Boston. 
Boston was just the match that lit the powder keg. 
Like the tragic events at Lexington and Concord. 
 That's right. 
 Yes. 
We are sick of the long hours, The crappy food, sharing offices with the one black guy in New York who sucks. 
Getting stuck with new cast members who don't even hit on us once. 
Stop trying to send dirty text messages to my land line, Jenna. 
And the winter. 
Oh, lord. 
The winter. 
Really? 
You're blaming me for winter? 
Well, we've got to blame someone. 
Who's it gonna be if it's not you? 
You want someone to blame? 
I'll give you someone to blame. 
Dale Snitterman. 
Okay, I'm out. 
Who the hell is Dale Snitterman? 
Dale Snitterman is the guy at NBC who makes all the decisions that make us unhappy. 
Snitterman is the one Who cancelled taco night in the commissary. 
Snitterman is the one who okayed that cast photo where your hair looks green. 
He's the one who keeps rejecting your "summer shorts for the pages" idea. 
Sounds like one of King George's hated tax collectors. 
Exactly. 
Thank you, Tracy. 
You guys think I'm the bad guy? 
Fine. I don't care. 
But I fight for you every day. 
And if Dale Snitterman had his way, the show wouldn't even be on. 
That vondruke! 
And all we can do to get back at him is put on the best damn show that we can, and not give him the satisfaction of everybody turning on each other. 
Or me. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Yeah! Yeah! 
I love you guys. 
You wanted to see the world's greatest manager? 
Is Kiyoshi Kawashima of Honda here? 
No, it's me. 
I'm a genius. 
I made up a fake NBC executive and blamed everything that has ever gone wrong on him. 
The imaginary enemy. 
Classic move, Lemon. 
The Salem witch trials, the red scare, global warming. 
Now that you've cleaned up your little mess, I'll need to borrow some of your people to go to an open house in Waltham for me. 
Charlie what now? 
Nancy spilled everything. 
Her husband left. 
And they're getting divorced If she can find someone to buy their house. 
And that someone is you. 
I'm just going to be the money man. 
The transaction will be conducted by one of your staff, Who will be operating under the alter ego Silas Marymount-Peppercorn, Uh, a name I came up with. 
Oh, you should have come to me for your fake name. 
My executive? 
Dale Snitterman. 
Amazing, Lemon. 
Where do you come up with this stuff? 
Well, you know, The creative process is always a mystery. 
I just wish I could get inside that marvelous brain of yours. 
Oh, wait. 
I can. 
Okay, in this instance, The creative process was that I saw that name, forgot that I saw it, and said it later. 
Then, in 1754, I graduated from university here in Boston. 
Well, not in Boston, but nearby. 
No, not tufts. 
Don't listen to him! 
We fell for his lies 300 years ago. 
Don't let this slave-owning time traveler fool us again! 
Excuse me, John Hancock was a patriot. 
Then patriots are overrated. 
Hey! 
What'd you say about the patriots? 
I said they suck! 
Uh-oh. 
Here come the punches. 
This was all Snitterman's fault. 
electricity crackles] Are you here for the open house? 
Hello. 
We are here from a different town for the open house, because we are interested in purchasing a house in this area. 
I'm Nancy, the owner. 
I am Silas Marymount-Peppercorn, And this is my first wife... 
Moronica. 
It's nice to meet you. 
I'm British. 
My wife and I have disparate levels of attractiveness, because I am a successful inventor. 
Well, I got to be honest. 
I was wondering. 
Well, all right. 
It's a... 
it's a three bedroom, and a partially-finished basement. 
Partially finished? 
I'll take it! 
Dudes, you are not gonna believe this. 
Snitterman is here. 
What? 
I was wandering around upstairs, Checking out the local cleaning lady talent, And I found that son of a bitch's office. 
He's in Boston? 
We should go up there and mess him up for all the crap he's put us through. 
Right, Liz? 
Let's get him! 
Yeah! 
Kill! 
Okay, don't... 
Oh, boy. 
Okay. Oh, boy. 
You little bitch. 
 What? 
 Look at you. 
You're just a suit. 
You're nobody! 
I don't even know why I was scared of this guy. 
Look, there must be some mistake. 
Don't try to explain yourself, Snitterman. 
You don't talk. 
You don't talk at all. 
Aah! 
Hey! Hey! Hey! 
Okay, I think he's really scared. 
We've done enough here. 
Never. 
Lutz! 
Truffle-shuffle him! 
Truffle shuffle! 
Truffle shuffle! 
 Truffle shuffle! 
 Hey, what are you...? 
Yeah, take that, Snitterman. 
That's what you get for making us work late tonight. 
Yeah! 
We're working late tonight because of you! 
So how was the open house? 
Well, somebody actually came, for once. 
Nice young couple. 
Weird last name, though. 
I'm sure your name is weird to them. 
Any reason to open this? 
Did they make an offer? 
No, they didn't. 
Really? Are you sure? 
Yeah. 
That house is never gonna sell. 
I'm gonna take it off the market And see what happens in a year or so. 
Well, what about your plans? 
The condo? 
The store for pale teens? 
I can't run a store, make change for people. 
Have another open house. 
I bet someone offers cash this time. 
Not with that broken doorbell. 
We'll have it fixed. 
I had an offer, okay? 
For ten grand over the asking price. 
So what's the problem? 
The problem is that I've been married for 23 years. 
The dumb house is just an excuse to stay put. 
You know, I'm not ready for a new life, Jack. 
Not ready? 
Nancy, we're 50. 
Yeah, and that's too old to rush into anything. 
You know, you're not from here anymore. 
You know, down in New York people are like, "let's get divorced. 
"you marry the butler, And I'll be a gay octomom." 
It's different here. 
People judge you. 
Who cares what people around here think? 
Your neighbors named their daughter Belichick! 
I don't want to talk about it anymore. 
Of course you don't want to talk about it,  You repressed, Irish maniac. 
 Don't want to talk about it. 
You must know that I have feelings for you. 
No. Not talking. 
I don't want to pressure you, but if you were divorced... 
No, let's go to Kelly's. 
Let's get some roast beef. 
Nancy, let me talk. 
I'll give you two words. 
Ten. 
Four. 
Final offer. 
I'll wait. 
Not forever. 
I'll try. 
Wicked hard. 
Tracy, there you are. 
I want you to meet my fellow revolutionary And dear friend, Crispus Attucks, So you can see John Hancock has black friends. 
Uh-huh. 
And where did you two meet? 
Why, we met at the sons of liberty gathering. 
Uh, when was that, Crispus? 
1775? 
Really? 
So five years after Crispus Attucks was killed in the Boston massacre? 
Run, Crispus. 
He... he's on to us!
