Which of these pictures do you like better? 
Um,the one on the left? 
So the wacky one. 
Sure. What's the picture for? 
I'm giving the keynote address at the company's six sigma retreat to move forward in croton-on-hudson. 
Is that like a corporate retreat? 
I used to have to perform at those all the time back when jenna and i were in that improv troupe. 
The audience suggestion is sling blade and oprah on a date. 
I sure do like them french fried paters. 
no,you don't,oprah. 
Jenna is not a great improviser. 
To be honest,lemon,uh, i'm a little apprehensive about going to this thing. 
I haven't seen a lot of these people since the ceo debacle and my... 
Time in the... Bush administration. 
Yeah,jack,you never really told me what happened in washington. 
Please be gentle. 
The point is a lot has happened to me since the retreat last year. 
So i hope that when i return, they still think of me as the same guy. 
 You've got camp jitters. 
 What? 
You haven't seen your little business camp friends in a year, And now you're afraid everybody's gonna think you got weird. 
Uh,lemon,the retreat to move forward is a global meeting of ge's best and brightest. 
Careers are made there. 
It would be helpful to have someone with me who's got my back. 
Ugh,no. Don't make me 
be your camp friend. 
I hate those corporate things. 
Bunch of drunk people talking about synergy. 
First of all, never badmouth synergy. 
And i'm asking you to do this as a favor. 
Oh,fine! I'll go. For you. 
 As long as this place has a spa... 
 They do. 
Where you are allowed to eat in the sauna. 
Because at some places, they get mad.

Unless you make some serious lifestyle changes, You're in danger of becoming diabetic. 
So how bad is diabetes, really? 
It's quite serious. 
If left untreated, you could lose a foot. 
Could i replace it with a wheel, like rosie fromthe jetsons? 
I suppose. 
But then you'd have to register as a motor vehicle. 
Well,buddy,here we go. Bases 
loaded. Bottom of thninth. 
Are you gonna step up? Oh,yeah. 
Because it's winning time, you magnificent son of a bitch! 
You go in there and show them.

Just do it. Is it in you? I'm loving it! 
Are you okay? 
Oh,i'm sorry, i was just,uh... 
Were you psyching yourself up in the mirror? 
I do that sometimes before i go to a party where i don't know a lot of people. 
Stop sweating,you idiot. 
What is wrong with you, you stupid bitch! 
I wish you hadn't sn that. 
It's okay. Now you're ready to 
get in there. You're psyched up. 
You got your camp buddy. Just do it. 
You are a lion. Take what's yours. 
There they are the six sigmas themselves.

Insight. 
Brutality. 
Male enhancement. 
Handshakefulness. 
And play hard. 
Wish me luck. 
Men,if i'd known your wives were alone, i would've stayed in new york. 
Jack donaghy. We've been waiting 
all day for you to show up. 
 Uh,this is my friend  guys over in war machines have been dying to see you. 
The finulus data sugst r ocwe should be leveraging disintermediation paradigms.

Ohno i'm just here with my friend. Or i was. 
So you're like a g or an h? 
No,i'm not part of this. I'm not any letter. 
J? 
Morning,mr. Jordan. What's 
that on your foot,sir? 
It's a practice wheel for when i lose my foot to diabetes. 
You can't eat candy if you have diabetes. 
There's no link between diabetes and diet. 
That's a white myth,ken. 
Like larry bird or colorado. 
It's not a myth. 
Gentlemen, back me up here. 
I don't know. 
My dad had diabetes, and he ate whatever he wanted until he died on the day i was born. 
How do you not see the connection? 
You know, there's a conspiracy theory that after the civil war, the u.s.government spread false 
information about diabetes  Word.  To keep the newlyfreed 
slaves sluggish and docile. 
 And i heard that from yusef jackson. 
 Which is why to this day, most african americans don't understand that diabetes is caused by sleeping on your back. 
I don't think that's right. 
Diabetes and diet. 
Next you'll be telling me that leasi a sports car is a bad investment! 
Hey,nice suit, squaresville. 
Where's the bank? 
What can i do for you miss... Jimplin? 
Well,according to my wikipedia page, i'm gonna need some crrjuice, Buttermilk,and tequila to make my signature janis joplin cocktail, the frankschlong. 
Good grief. 
Hey,jack, where you been hiding? 
Oh,lemon,there you are. 
I'm sorry i got distracted.

I know. It's going great. I'm actually 
joining the six sigmas for lunch. 
Oh,okay. I like lunch.

for negating cris hierarchies. 
It's a competive teambuilding exercise where one person directs his teammates in the construction of a lego model That only he can see. 
Lemon,why don't you join team donaghy? 
We'll win this thing, and then we'll go to c.l.a.s. 
I don't want to go to a class. 
No,lemon,c.l.a.s. It's an acronym for 
"consuming lunch and simple socializing." 
now that just seems intentionally confusing. 
K. 
What's up with this disgusting stuff? 
Mr. Jordan, i've seen too many folks back

You need teat better.

Oh,you want to hear tell of the hill witch? 
My meemaw saw her once taking away a boy who wouldn't eat his vegetables. 
She's a shriveled crone, 1,000 years old. 
One look turns you to stone, and then she gorges your living brain. 
Through the stone? 
Really,ken? That was your plan. 
Doubt me if you dare. 
But beware the omens of her coming. 
Crops will fail. 
Animals will run wild. 
And my page desk will be turned sideways.

Well,of course i'm taking it seriously. 
This is my chance to win an oscar.

Uh-doyee! 
It goes on top. It's a smokestack. 
Yeah! 
Suck it,nerds! 
 What happened to you, donaghy? 
 What do you mean? 
That woman is a subordinate of yours. 
Her behavior is totally inappropriate. 
Familiarity. Nicknameification. 
And you seem to encourage it. 
Well,lemon is unique. 
Okay. 
But the old jack donaghy wouldn't have stood for that. 
Sorry! I dropped it when i 
was pretending it was my penis! 
Robot penis. 
We won! 
Oh,hey,jenna. 
Um,about last night... 
Oh,god. 
I just want to make sure you haven't told anyone what happened. 
I have a lot of irons in the fire around he. 
You'll keep it to yourself, right? 
Oh,yes. Of course. Thank you. 
Yeah. 
Wait. I'm sorry. You don't 
want people to know about us? 
Oh,god,no. I mean, it's so embarrassing. 
Yeah,for me. You should 
want to brag about it. 
Don't worry about that. Last 
night was stupid. Stupid,frank! 
No,last night was the best thing that's ever happened to you. 
It was my mistake, not yours. 
I'm the one who had to take the silkwood shower this morning. 
Okay,fine. Whatever. But 
you'll be cool about this? 
You... The one... Who cool... Should be. 
Oh,all right. Cool. 
Wha-- what the hell was that? 
First of all, ere's an omelet bar downstairs. 
So you should probably go get yourself an omelet. 
Second,i want to see if your room is bigger than mine. 
Oh,you have a sitting area? You jag. 
Uh,please come in. 
Lemon,i give u a certain amount of leeway at work. 
But while we're here, i need you to behave appropriately. 
What are you talking about? 
Well,the,uh,nicknames, the arm punching, the familiarity. 
The way you were behaving at l.u.n.c.h. 
You can't say "uh-doyee" to me in mixed company. 
Okay. 
So when i helped you win that lego thing when i thought we were having fun together, I was actually embarrassing you, is that right,jack? 
While we're here,i need you to call me mr. Donaghy. 
I get it. 
You broughme here in case you need me. 
But now that you have your cool six sigma friends, I can go back to the lake with the fat kids and make bracelets. 
Lemon,you know how important this is to me. I've got my speech tonight. 
Yeah,don't worry. I get boundaries. 
Ooh,sorry,liz,my parent's basement only has room for five sleeping bags. 
Or,no,i'll come over after prom and we'll make nachos together. 
Lemon,this is a part of our problem. 
I give you a simple managerial suggestion in a professional context, And i get back the second half of a judy blume novel. 
Whatever. This place is dumb. 
We're gonna be back at work tomorrow. 
Let's not make this bigger than it is. 
Too late. Friendship over. 
Good lor like a waitress.

That's a good one, prashant. 
So i heard about you and frank. 
Ugh,i know. It's hard to believe.
