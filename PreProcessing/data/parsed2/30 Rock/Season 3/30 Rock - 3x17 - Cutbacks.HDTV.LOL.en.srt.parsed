So where's that conference room? 
 Oh. Golly. 
 Whoa, k. 
I am sorry, mr. Jordan. 
I'm just overworked. 
With my page duties and being mr. Donaghy's assistant, 
There's not enough hours in the day. 
I'm sorry about that. 
But just let me know if there's any way i can help. 
 Actually, there is one thing. 
 No. I was just saying that. 
Why can't you read human facial queues? 
All right, what is it? 
Well, with both these jobs, I don't know when i'm gonna be able to get home. 
I'm worried about my bird, sonny crockett. 
Would you mind going to my apent and feeding him? 
Yeah, okay. Birds are 
like little dinosaurs. 
So what i'll be doing is actually pretty cool and brave. 
Thank you, sir. 
Here are my keys. 
Oh, and one thing, don't go into my bedroom. 
 What? 
 Do not go into my bedroom. 
25%? How am i supposed 
to cut a quarter of our budget? 
Well, there is some fat. 
What about sid? 
Sid? I can't fire our announcer. 
He'll lose his insurance. 
You know, he has a lot of health problems. 
Yeah, because he was hit by lightning And can't really talk anymore. 
It's tergis with tracky ng-Jong And jimmy moop! 
No. Sid is off the table. 
I'm not firing any of my people. 
I'm not doing that to their families. 
Or in sid's case, their much younger wife With whom they have an open relationship. 
All right, we'll find the money somewhere else. 
 The food budget  No! 
All right, what about straws? 
We spend $1,200 a year on straws. 
Okay, fine. No mstraws. 
Everyone drinks from the can from now on. 
 Oh, no, we need straws. 
 Oh, god! That's its bathroom! 
Listen, liz, i'm gonna need your revised budget By the end of today. 
I don't know, brad. 
Tgs is a complicated machine. 
 Every part's important. 
 Get it. 
You don't want to be the bad guy. 
But if you don't make the cuts, i will. 
And i don't give a crap about anyone here. 
Matthew, i know this isn't ea But the company's facing cutbacks. 
And you have to admit your boom box division Is a little bit behind the times. 
We're not behind the times, we're groovy! 
I can offer you two weeks severance. 
Mr. Donaghy, i know you said only 
interrupt you If it was very important, But tashonda from time warner cable Is on the phone And she's offering three free months of showtime. 
But we have to act now. 
Kenneth, this does not qualify As something important. 
I do not want showtime. 
Oh, okay. 
I'm sorry. 
I just didn't want you to miss out On this exciting opportunity Thank you, kenneth. 
Take your time. 
Hey, little guy. 
don't go in the bedroom. 
 Don't go in the bedroom. 
 I wasn't going to! 
I wa't going to! Bye! 
Hello, miss lemon. 
Are you here to see kenneth the page Or kenneth the mr. Donaghy's assistant? 
Well, i need to see jack. 
Hello, miss lemon. 
Mr. Donaghy is in an important meeting. 
And i've been told not to interrupt him. 
What is this pertaining to? 
The tgs budget. 
Oh, my. That sounds very important. 
 Mr. Donaghy. 
 Kenneth! 
i've worked here 20 years. 
I was wrong. 
That was not important enough. 
It's me, kenneth the page, this job is hard. 
Please have a seat. 
Mr. Donaghy will be right with you. 
Do you know what these meetings are about? 
I hear people are getting fired. 
Yeah. I don't know. 
 Do you know jack donaghy well? 
 Pretty well. 
Do you happen to know If he's a boob man or a butt man? 
 What? Why wouou ask that? 
 Because i don't want to get fired. 
So i'm gonna have to go in there And boink my way out of this I'm cheryl, by the way. 
You're gonna try to have sex with jack? 
I have to. 
I have 15 employees. 
I'm responsible for them. 
Do you have any idea what that's like? 
Well, yeah, i have 200 people under me, but Wow. Maybe we could team up, 
go in there together,  lez out, give him a show. 
 No. Cheryl, get a grip. 
Oh, boy. 
Miss lemon, mr. Donaghy 
will see you now. 
Make it quick, lemon. 
I'm in the middle of a very unpleasant day. 
Okay, well, so am i. 
I know this cutback stuff is difficult. 
I don't want to fire anyone. 
And i don't want to take anything away from my crew. 
And i want to keep making free, long-Distance prank calls To people like seattle's richard sacmuncher. 
And i think that's reasonable. 
So what do i do to get out of this? 
The only thing to do is make your cuts And live to fight another day. 
What? That's it? 
I thought you'd tell me to cook the numbers Or shred something or do some pelican brief stuff. 
Why is everyone talking about that movie? 
It's playing on showtime. 
Kenneth, get me showtime. 
What? Why now? 
I'm sorry. 
I know this is hard, but there's no way out of it. 
Well, little heads up, Your next meeting might disagree. 
She's planning to change your mind By hitting... 
 ...that. 
 Oh, no, not again. 
This last guy tried to take my belt off. 
But the sad thing is, it sometimes works. 
Sexual bartering pays off. 
Salome. Mata hari. 
Deborah norville. 
Well, good luck downstairs. 
I'm sure you'll figure it out. 
Oh, and one more thing, uh, don't cut the straw budget 'Cause i've already cut the exterminators. 
Jenna, something weird is going on. 
You mean this budget stuff? 
Don't worry about it, tracy. 
It's just gonna affect the non-Specials. 
No, it's not that. 
Jenna, you're the smartest person i know. 
You think kenneth could be a murderer? 
What? Why would you 
think that? 
Well, i might be crazy, But neither he nor his bird would let me into his bedroom. 
And why wouldn't you want to let tracy jordan Into your bedroom unless you got a bunch Of dead nurses in there? 
Well, i had to study serial killers To prepare for my role as criminal profiler Jill st. Ferrari 
in the lifetime original miniseries Hushed rapings. 
And all masked murderers share three characteristics: Cruelty to animals... 
 He grew up killing pigs! 
 Bedwetting. 
No wonder he's fascinated when i do that! 
And an inability to read human facial queues! 
I admonished him for that earlier! 
Three for three. 
He's a monster! 
Okay, we've gotta go tell jack. 
You know, if kenneth is actually a killer, We're gonna be heroes. 
Liz, our food is gone. 
They took it. 
It happened this morning. 
Do you have a cookie? 
Mommy's baby needs his yum-Yums. 
Oh, my god. 
Sid, did you get fired? 
Good-Bye, lerz. 
 Liz, it's a massacre! 
 What is going on? 
Brad came in this morning and started making cuts. 
I can't go back to teaching high school math. 
Those girls pretend they're not women yet, But they are. 
 Do something, liz. 
 You're our only hope. 
Halster, you look hot in those trousers.

He's ready for you now. 
I've got chills. 
He's evil.

It's so creepy! 
Jenna, i just want you to know that if we find Any human remains in there, I'm gonna throw up all over your face. 
Oh, no! 
Kenneth's a murderer and the riddler's coming!

 It's poisonous. Ah! 
 Ah! 
So thanks for dinner. 
 You sure know a lot about sushi. 
 Well, you gotta be careful. 
They try to up-Sell you the real crab. 
 So... 
 so... 
list, i gotta get going. 
i got a lotta work tomorrow. 
all right, listen, we're both adults here. 
We know the deal. 
Let's cut to the chase. 
That's certainly direct. 
We go upstairs.20 minutes. 
Open mouth.I will work your ears. 
I don't know, liz. What you're 
asking me to do is a big deal. 
If i go through with this, i need to know it's worth it. 
Fine. 30 minutes. 
I'll make some sounds. 
And you can say one weird thing to me. 
All right, hardball. 
30 minutes. sounds. 
Top front of my body is now in play. Deal? 
Deal. 
Lemon, i heard a rumor that you went out With one of the consultants last night. 
Well, i had no choice. 
I had to give him a little taste of the lemon. 
And it was not sour, my friend. Not sour. 
It's interesting you put it that way Because your writers' room is now the headquarters For telemundo's coverage of world cup soccer qualifying. 
Equador tiene que ganar o atar contra peru Para avanzar en los finales. 
 What the what?! 
 Ssh. 
Brad and i had a deal. 
I gave him top front. 
Top front? Good lord, lemon, 
that's your worst quadrant. 
Kenneth, you know how you told tracy Not to into your bedroom? 
Well, naturally, we assumed you were a serial killer. 
and as you can imagine, your bird is dead. 
yeah, but on the bright side, You've been downgraded From "suspect" to "person of interest." 
Some day, we're gonna look back on this and laugh. 
time does heal all wounds! 
now you wait just one minute. 
I am sorry to be using my barn voice In front of a lady, but i am riled up. 
it is not enough that you killed the bird I've had for almost 60 years. 
But the fact that you didn't trust me is unforgivable. 
But whd i expect? 
Look at you two walking around without a care in the world As budgets are slashed And people keep getting called into mr. Donaghy's office To be fired. 
I may just be a non-Special, But what you two did is inexcusable. 
Good day. 
I'm out of letters.I have to 
return my kids' braces. 
What did you do? 
We trusted you! 
You ruined it with your talking, didn't you? 
Hey! 
Why are you still messing with my show? 
What about last night? 
Liz, last night was what it was, But business is business. 
Right. And last night, 
i gave you the business. 
We had an agreement. 
Top front and some light ear work! 
You got your quid, halst where's my quo? 
Oh, my god. 
Last night was about the show? 
Oh, please, you know it was. 
You were all, oh, it's gotta be worth it And what you're asking me to do is such a big deal. 
It was a big deal. 
Being with a woman for the first time since my wife died. 
 Ah, snap. 
 It was just a transaction? 
What kind of person are you?! 
Does it help if i tell you I thought we were doing sexual espionage? 
Oh, god. 
Sharon! Angel! 
i swore to you the next one would be worthy, But she's not! 
she's a monster! 
Marissa, add dr. Walters 
to my sched. 
Let's go. Let's go. 
Let's go. 
Okay so mr. Halster has filed a complaint 
against you With human resources. 
Specifically, his claim suggests that you tried to barter sex In exchange for professional consideration. 
In the human resource world, We refer to that as "being a filthy prostitute." 
Now, since this is your first incident And, uh, mr. Donaghy has explained 
The mitigating circumstances... 
I'm convinced that this sexual outburst Was brought on by menopause. 
We are recommending only a two-Week suspension Without pay. 
Okay. That's fair. 
and obviously mr. halster cannot 
function In this hostile work environment. 
His company has reassigned him. 
And your budget review process will start over again Under my supervision. 
 Really. 
 Yes, really. 
I hope you've learned your lesson, miss lemon. 
When you harass sexually in the workplace, Things do not somehow just work out in the end. 
Mr. Donaghy, i thought you'd like to know 
That there's a spider on the printer. 
Oh, no. 
Am i interrupting? 
Is this another firing meeting? 
It is now. 
Kenneth, have a seat. 
Ken, we feel bad that we But mostly jenna--Gassed your bird. 
I agree. 
Not to name names, but it's so sad That a certain black individual Found it necessary to trick someone so pretty Into believing you were a murderer. 
I'm sorry, is there a point to all this? 
I've had a bad couple of days. 
Well, we feel terrible about what happened, So we did a little something to make it up to you. 
looks like i've got some naming to do. 
Pat. Balthazar. Donna. 
lorne. michael.
